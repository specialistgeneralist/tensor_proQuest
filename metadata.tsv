No pressure, Ashleigh, but …	The Australian	42 years since our last Australian champion is a long time
Playing in front of the home crowd at the Australian Open can be daunting even for tennis champions. The careers of Pat Cash, Lleyton Hewitt, Pat Rafter and Samantha Stosur, who won slam tournaments overseas but not in Melbourne, attest to that.
On Saturday night Ashleigh Barty, 23, from Springfield, west of Brisbane, experienced how good it is to win at home when she defeated Ukrainian teenager Dayana Yastremska to capture the Adelaide International, her first Women’s Tennis Association title in Australia. “I definitely feel the love out here,” Barty said. “I love playing in Australia, I love playing at home, and it’s been incredible for my team and I to enjoy this week.” Like all Australians, we hope she and they enjoy the coming fortnight at Melbourne Park even more, from Monday night’s opener to the end of the second week. The Open also marks the 50th anniversary of Margaret Court’s calendar grand slam.
Barty, the current French Open champion and winner of the 2019 WTA Finals in Shenzhen, China, starts the Open as the world’s No 1 player and top seed. It has been decades since an Australian woman was in that position. But the competition will be fierce, with rivals such as Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams having plenty to prove.Barty reportedly prefers toasting her big victories with beer instead of champagne. If she plays her best, plenty of both could be flowing for her and for Aussie tennis fans on Saturday week.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Testing time as we await the jab	The Australian	A breakout of the UK COVID variant would pose a new threat
The detection in Western Australia of another case of the new, more infectious coronavirus variant that has wreaked havoc in the UK underlines the need for all states and territories to enact effective precautions to prevent it escaping into the community from international quarantine hotels. These precautions must cover airline, airport, transport, hotel and medical staff. WA Premier Mark McGowan said the traveller had returned from Poland via Doha. Three people in quarantine in the west have been diagnosed with the UK variant, which has been found to be 50 to 70 per cent more contagious than the main strain. Four cases of the super strain also have been detected in Victoria’s hotel quarantine program, where health authorities reportedly are considering closing up to UK arrivals. Barring Australians from home would be a harsh barrier too far. But, as Scott Morrison said on Tuesday, the UK strain is a great concern. Health ministers, who are meeting this week, and medical officers, who meet every day, need to devise a strategy, and governments and stakeholders must implement it as soon as possible.
Britain, Jacquelin Magnay reported on Tuesday, has been “plunged into its darkest mood since the depths of World War II” following Boris Johnson’s announcement of its third severe lockdown, to last for at least seven weeks. Despite weeks of strict tier four lockdown, 58,784 new COVID-19 cases, a 42 per cent spike in a week, and another 407 deaths were recorded in Britain on Monday. The medical system is close to being overwhelmed, prompting the Johnson government to move to tier five restrictions, closing all schools, universities, cancelling exams, limiting sales of takeaway alcohol and returning citizens to virtual house arrest. As Magnay writes, people have been “worn down by the first 100-day lockdown in March, April, May and June, where everything bar a local supermarket and chemist was closed, and then since October a series of tiers and lockups … everyone is resigned to the most dire of winters and even spring”. Businesses and jobs are collapsing.
Recovery will hinge on a successful mass inoculation program. Its 1.39 per cent coverage is comparable to 1.38 per cent in the US. Those figures are dwarfed, however, by Israel vaccinating more than 14 per cent of its 10 million people. Israel has made vaccination a priority. As a nation that faces daily threats to its existence, it has shown its remarkable capacity to respond during an emergency. With Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration expected to approve the Pfizer vaccine this month, debate is turning to whether the Morrison government’s plan to roll it out from March is soon enough. The situation around the world is grim, but the move by Qantas to sell overseas flights from July is a welcome sign of hope. We also await World Health Organisation investigators’ findings about the origin of COVID in Wuhan with intense interest. The claim by US Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger that the most “credible” theory around the origin of the virus is that it escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology is too serious to be ignored.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Striking a balance on emissions	The Australian	A coherent national energy policy would boost investment
Only three countries — Marshall Islands, Suriname and Norway — met last Sunday’s Paris Agreement deadline to lodge new plans to boost action on climate change. Those nations account for 0.1 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, or what China produces in 30 hours. In 2015, 195 countries signed the agreement, so the poor response is disconcerting for UN officials. But like a lot of the fine print in climate policy, what countries put their names to is not legally binding as we understand it. The Morrison government is due to deliver a long-term emissions reduction strategy ahead of the 2020 UN Climate Change Conference, also known as COP 26, in Glasgow in November.
There is a lot of gassed-up talk on the road to Glasgow. Host Boris Johnson says he wants to get saving the planet done, pledging Britain will lead the way and calling on nations to accept zero emissions by 2050. He says he will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. According to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, 70 countries had committed to carbon neutrality by 2050. Here, the Business Council of Australia is plotting a new policy push to formally back a price on carbon and net-zero emissions by 2050, while states and territories are putting such targets in lights. Canberra also is considering a net zero by 2050 target.
But Scott Morrison is adamant he won’t do so if it leads to higher power prices and job losses. “What troubles me is that there are plenty of people at the moment who will go out and make a glib promise about that and they can’t look Australians in the eye and tell them what it will mean for their electricity prices, what it will mean for their jobs,” he said last month. What would it cost? Who knows, because 30 years is a long time and technological change is the great variable. Climate economist Brian Fisher says Australia will need to embrace electric and hydrogen-fuelled ­vehicles — and consider nuclear power to back up an electricity sector heavily dependent on solar and wind — if it is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. He also says technologies to reduce methane emissions and improve carbon capture and storage could be embraced to achieve the target. Yet as we, business groups and Dr Fisher have long argued, a price on carbon and an option to trade emission reductions across borders would offer least-cost abatement.
The Prime Minister utterly rejects pricing schemes, higher taxes and arbitrary targets. So we are in second-best policy territory here, given the toxic politics over a decade and within the Coalition right now. Yet he is right to identify the Paris model as defective. Many nations have the agreement on death watch. Mr Morrison argues he wants a better global approach and is sticking to the 2030 target of reducing emissions by between 26 and 28 per cent on 2005 levels. The Coalition is emphasising gas as a transition fuel, as the recent deal with NSW shows, and spending on renewables and storage, like Snowy 2.0.
For good or ill, the Coalition’s path to emission cuts, at home and abroad, is via new technologies. Its big set-piece is the technology investment road map, to be released soon for public ­debate. It will examine over 100 technologies including hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, biofuels, lithium production and advances in agriculture to reduce methane emissions. The road map will set the government’s technology investment priorities over three periods: to 2022, 2030 and 2050.Mr Morrison is cautiously seeking the political middle ground, spending on direct action measures and trying to change the narrative. On the extremes, there’s the coal-fired fury of Nationals’ populists and Adam Bandt’s alarmism about “destruction and death on a widespread scale” from fossil fuels. The Prime Minister must be mindful of the temperature and vibe of Glasgow. His practical instincts will be to keep arguing for a technological approach, one that is likely to find support in his partyroom and in the wider electorate. But to be successful in the long game of reducing emissions, Australia needs businesses to revamp their approach and to invest in technology. They’ll need incentives — like a price signal or taxpayer subsidy — to do that. Until we settle on a coherent national energy policy, business and investors will be left operating in a risky no man’s land.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics

Investment is the missing piece in economic puzzle	The Australian	A cut in the company tax rate would boost jobs and growth
The equities rally continues apace, with the local market hitting a record high at the close of trading on Monday. Someone should tell the Australian bourse to pull its head in: the market price to earnings ratio is at more than 18 times. Despite the less than bullish outlook for company profits and GDP growth, that won’t happen in a hurry. Frothy markets are being led by the US Federal Reserve’s easy money regime. At home, the Reserve Bank’s ultra-low interest rates — the official cash rate has been cut three times since June to be at 0.75 per cent — have not sparked a recovery in consumer spending or business investment. But Martin Place’s monetary easing has seen highly indebted households repair their balance sheets, as well as an escalation in asset prices, including for shares and homes in Sydney and Melbourne.
Another central bank rate cut is expected, possibly as early as next month, given the sluggishness of the economy, made worse by the drought and bushfire disaster. Wise heads, such as former RBA board member and economics professor Warwick McKibbin, have called for the central bank to hold fire on further reductions, warning lower rates would deepen fears about the prospects for growth. A reminder about the broader economy’s softness comes from the International Monetary Fund. As we report on Tuesday, the IMF has revised down its forecasts slightly for global output for this year and next, due in part to weakness in India, which is plagued by social unrest. Although the US-China trade dispute is being dismantled and the cloud over Brexit is lifting, there is uncertainty around exports and commodity prices.
Australia is meandering in the slow lane. The economy is expanding but growth is neither broadbased nor strong enough in those areas that will underpin our future prosperity. GDP growth is being driven by exports and Canberra’s social spending while being held back by weak consumer spending, the drought and slumps in housing construction and business investment. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, issued in the week before Christmas, revealed a huge writedown in projected budget surpluses off the back of weaker expectations for output, wages and export prices. Treasury has pared back its GDP forecast to 2.25 per cent this financial year, rising to 2.75 per cent in 2020-21. A collapse in business and consumer confidence will see the nation treading water, according to Deloitte Access Economics.
We need policies to break a mood of gloom and “can’t do”. Josh Frydenberg argues the sombre outlook confirms the importance of prudent management. If needed, the Treasurer says, “Australia can use fiscal firepower in a way few other nations can.” On Monday, Mr Frydenberg said it was too early to tell the effect of bushfires on the budget. In truth, the budget is in balance and claiming to be “back in black”, a goal we wholeheartedly endorse, is more a political branding exercise than a precise economic setting when the ensuing fiscal quantum is so meagre.
A possible circuit-breaker is a tax incentive for investment, which is being pushed by Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox. Writing for us on Tuesday, Mr Willox calls for a “generous investment allowance” to bring forward and increase business investment. “The government should act immediately to get private sector investment moving to stimulate the broader economy, reignite jobs growth and lift flatlining productivity,” he argues. The way Mr Willox sees it, the measure would allow businesses to deduct for tax purposes a larger proportion of their spending on capital equipment in the year of purchase rather than wait until later years to claw back the expenditure. He believes the government should not wait for the budget in May but should announce and implement the measure as soon as possible. Labor supports the move.
The proposal is in the same policy territory as one advocated by the Business Council of Australia. In its pre-budget submission, the lobby for big business called for a new permanent broadbased investment allowance, set as a bonus deduction of 10 per cent in an asset’s first year. In simple terms, the effect is to increase the after-tax return on an investment so projects that may not be viable now will get the go-ahead. We support this in principle but fear revenue will be lost on projects that would have gone ahead anyway. These ideas, variations on previous policies, are likely to find their way into Mr Frydenberg’s second budget in some form. They will improve the economy’s supply side, leading to innovation in products and productivity growth over time, as the capital base is enhanced.
Yet, like the business groups, we see such tax breaks as ad hoc, second-best policy measures. A better, enduring reform would be to lower the company tax rate for all enterprises. The BCA framed its investment allowance as an interim measure, before an across-the-board company tax rate of 25 per cent could be achieved. As Mr Willox has argued, the company tax rate needs to be simplified because it is “out of whack with our competitors”. Such a potent move is politically out of the question for a government with a wafer-thin majority, facing a fractious Senate crossbench and a Labor opposition that under its previous leader waged a war on the “top end of town”, capitalism in general, and refunds for excess franking credits in particular.The Coalition government over the past two budgets has cut taxes by more than $300bn but has ruled out revisiting tax cuts for big businesses. It is now relying on a modest productivity agenda, based on new infrastructure, better skills and tax breaks for smaller businesses. The government is moving quickly to help repair communities shattered by bushfires, with more than $500m in emergency funding already announced. But the economy needs game-changing moves. To restore confidence, the government must craft a fresh message on the economy and a few bold policy reforms to kickstart investment.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Killer who haunted the nation	The Australian	A deadly chapter in our criminal history is not quite closed The monster who has haunted Perth for more than two decades finally has been brought to justice. On Thursday, Bradley Robert Edwards was convicted on two counts of murder but acquitted of a third. His despicable rampage spanned at least eight years, terrifying and transfixing the nation, especially Western Australia. His killing spree bore the hallmarks of sexually depraved predators dramatised in crime fiction. To those whose loved ones’ lives were wantonly extinguished or who fortuitously escaped death, the trauma inflicted by the calculating pervert will haunt them forever.
For those not directly affected, it is easy to content ourselves with cliches such as “justice has been done” or that loved ones can now “achieve closure”. Such trite consolation will not afford comfort to the brave families who attended court to hear the depredations committed against their beloved girls. To the families of Jane Rimmer and Ciara Glennon, we extend our deepest condolences. No words can comfort the parent who has lost a child in such a ghastly manner. Even more distressing is the plight of the parents of Sarah Spiers, whose disappearance at the height of Edwards’s reign of terror strongly suggests that she, too, was murdered by him. In the absence of her remains, Justice Stephen Hall was unable to satisfy himself beyond reasonable doubt that Edwards had abducted and murdered her. Justice Hall did not dismiss the “possibility or even the probability” that she met the same fate as Rimmer and Glennon. If, as seems likely, Edwards is imprisoned for the rest of his life, it is to be hoped he will at least afford the Spiers family some degree of certainty by confessing his crime and assisting with the recovery of her remains to allow them to farewell their child. Nothing in his past suggests that he is capable of remorse, much less human empathy. Other women who survived his terrifying assaults when he was known as the Huntingdale Prowler also will bear the psychological scars of their brush with death.
At least this is a day for collective relief that this deviant can never strike again. It is not a day for recrimination. That would merely compound the misery of the bereaved families, especially the parents of Spiers.
Yet it is difficult not to ponder whether there may have been other, unreported victims. Likewise, how did Edwards remain at large for so long, given that his proclivities for violence were known as early as May 1990? He was forced to undertake a sex offenders treatment program after a spontaneous assault on a woman at Hollywood Hospital. His murderous rampage lay in the future. Could it have been avoided? It also is reasonable to ask how he escaped suspicion for the escalating wave of sexual violence by the “Claremont Killer” for so long. Even a quarter of a century on, those whose lives he tore asunder will never know freedom from the harm he inflicted.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Chinese immunity from truth	The Australian	A fake blame game will not foster COVID-19 co-operation
The world’s largest economies, the US and China, have a crucial role to play in sorting out the COVID-19 pandemic and its global consequences. But in spreading delusional claims about the origins of the virus, China is undermining the co-operation needed. As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a “prickly” meeting with a senior Chinese diplomat, this is no time to be spreading “disinformation and outlandish rumours” about responsibility for coronavirus. In a series of bizarre tweets, Lijian Zhao, a senior spokesman in Beijing’s foreign ministry, claimed the virus was spread by the US Army at the Military World Games in Wuhan last October.
“US Army brought the epidemic to Wuhan … US owe us an explanation!” Mr Zhao tweeted, in an attempt to deny China’s culpability and muddy the waters. Mr Zhao also tweeted a report from a wacky Canadian-based outfit aligned with Russian propaganda, which claimed the virus “escaped” from a US weapons laboratory and was planted in Wuhan. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang also lashed out at those seeking to “connect the coronavirus with China”. Donald Trump, in righteous albeit outspoken indignation, responded. He referred to “the Chinese virus” at a press conference, naming China as “the source” of the pandemic. China was “putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them”. Mr Pompeo rubbed in the salt, referring, not inaccurately, to the “Wuhan virus”.
Wuhan is unquestionably where the virus began, which makes it hard to fathom what Beijing wants to achieve. Trying to deflect the focus by implying a conspiracy is in line with the extreme sensitivity of Chinese officialdom from the start. China last month revoked the credentials of three Wall Street Journal correspondents, claiming a headline (which they had nothing to do with) referring to China as “the real sick man of Asia” was derogatory. The piece criticised Beijing’s handling of the outbreak. On Wednesday, Beijing expelled US citizens working for The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Voice of America and Time.Trusted reporting on China and level-headed analysis have never mattered more. Beijing is doing itself and the world a grave disservice in seeking to muddy the waters about the pandemic’s origins. As a key player in the community of nations, Beijing’s irrational theories are as unhelpful as it is possible to be in the crisis.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Saving lives and jobs both priorities amid pandemic	The Australian	A few positive signs are emerging in the COVID-19 battle
Two-thirds of the nation’s nearly 4000 cases of coronavirus were acquired overseas — a statistic that is guiding governments’ moves to minimise further spread of the disease. With thousands more Australians set to fly in this week, the risks of them spreading the disease underline the importance of quarantining all overseas arrivals in city hotels for 14 days, cut off from family, friends and the community. Thousands are already ensconced, which is also helping the embattled hotel industry. Most people, by their behaviour, have shown they understand and accept that no chances can be taken with quarantining and social distancing.
In stark contrast, it is difficult to comprehend the actions of a group of medical professionals who did not go into quarantine when they arrived from Chile on Friday night. The group had been attending a medical conference aboard a cruise liner off the South American coast. The 14-day hotel quarantine had not taken effect at that stage and one of the doctors said on Sunday NSW police officers had told her she could travel on to Melbourne. Even so, surely doctors are the very people who should know better. As Victorian Chief Medical Officer Brett Sutton said of the crowds at St Kilda beach who made a mockery of social-distancing, “really crap” behaviour could lead to “thousands of deaths”.
Compliance by the majority of people, thankfully, is starting to produce a glimmer of hope. Eight days ago, the rate of increase of COVID-19 cases was about 25 to 30 per cent a day. On Sunday morning Scott Morrison said the rate of increase had fallen to about 13 to 15 per cent. There is a long way to go. But the co-operation of the people, which Health Minister Greg Hunt described as “magnificent’’, was having an impact on the spread of the virus. There is no room for complacency. But in Queensland, Health Minister Steven Miles said he was heartened to see “we are flattening the curve’’, with the rate of growth last week half that of the week before, through social distancing and a drop in the number of people returning from overseas. In Sydney, the Berejiklian government has made a good move in asking Police Commissioner Mick Fuller to take charge of NSW’s response to the pandemic. He will co-ordinate the work of police, Australian Border Force and Defence personnel and manage those in quarantine. The crisis has also sparked innovation. A pin prick blood test which can identify if a patient is COVID-19 positive in less than 15 minutes will be rolled out this week by Australian biomedical research company, Cellmid.
On Sunday, Deputy Opposition Leader Richard Marles continued the opposition’s urging of the Morrison government to take even more stringent measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. “Whatever we’re thinking of doing a month from now, let’s do it today, and then that’s got to be the principle,’’ he told Sky News. Logic suggests it would make greater sense to get on top of the problem as quickly as possible rather than to be following the problem up the curve, “ which is what the language of a proportionate response necessarily implies’’, Mr Marles said. We disagree, while acknowledging co-operation between both sides of politics during the crisis.
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann’s defence of the government progressively implementing tighter restrictions, medical advice permitting, makes sense. The government will not “start gratuitously shutting down businesses because we are under political pressure”, he told the ABC on Sunday. Nor should it. Senator Cormann, who said “in the end we don’t believe we can stop the spread, we do want to slow the spread’’, posed three key questions for those demanding a more drastic shutdown. First, if the government were to shut the whole economy, when should it open again? Second, what would be the consequences? And third, if it were shut down to the point where nobody moves and the virus completely stops, what would happen when it reopened and the virus began spreading again? Such issues are not simple. Business and union leaders warned last week that Australia risks forever losing its steelmaking capacity and the permanent closure of smelters and refineries in the event of a total economic shutdown. It would be a mistake to think Australia has gone light and slow in the crisis. Dr Nick Coatsworth, one of the nation’s deputy chief medical officers and an infectious disease specialist, pointed out last week that Australia has “gone hard and fast” with unprecedented measures. If harsher strictures are to be avoided, compliance will be vital.The Morrison government is conscious it is not only managing a health crisis and an economic crisis brought on by the health crisis. It is aware that an economic crisis, the likes of which Australia has not experienced since the Depression, can also wreak havoc with health. “Every day someone is in a job, for just another day, is worth fighting for,’’ the Prime Minister said on Friday. “It matters to the person whose job it is, it matters to the business that has been built by someone over many years.’’ On Sunday, he announced $1.1bn to assist with the health effects — to boost Medicare-subsidised telehealth services and to support mental health and domestic violence services. The initiatives are part of a complex balancing act to ensure the coronavirus cure is not worse than the disease.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease

Most people, by their behaviour, have shown they understand and accept that no chances can be taken with quarantining and social distancing. In stark contrast, the irresponsibility of 33 medical professionals who disobeyed directions to go into quarantine when they arrived from Chile on Friday night beggars belief. The group had been attending a medical conference aboard a cruise liner off the South American coast. The 14-day hotel quarantine had not taken effect at that stage. But, despite being the very people who should know better, the 33 reportedly ducked away to the domestic terminal, from where 27 flew interstate. Police stopped the other six.

We say Level 2 — towards a safer ‘normal’	The New Zealand Herald	A fortnight ago, New Zealanders were waking up to the prospect of their last weekend in alert level 4 “lockdown” as the Government considered dropping the country to alert level 3.
After two weeks at that “restricted” contact level, we are now tantalisingly close to level 2 — the “reduced” contact phase, whereby the disease is considered contained, although the risk of community transmission remains.
There is perhaps even more anticipation this weekend after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday outlined the details of level 2 and the country awaits Cabinet’s decision on Monday about whether and when we will move down to that level.
Level 2 will make all the difference.
While the move to level 3 did allow some industries, retailers and education providers to resume operation, there were still significant limitations.
Socially, individuals were able to slightly expand their bubbles and extend their exercise perimeters, the message was still to stay at home and limit contact, and to continue to act as if everyone had Covid-19. For most people, it was lockdown-lite.
Level 2, however, will offer the biggest return to many of our freedoms of old and our “new normal” — or what the Prime Minister calls “a safer normal”.
The guiding principle of this stage will be “play it safe”, and physical distancing, hand hygiene, testing, contact tracing and staying home if sick will remain essential.
But level 2 will offer meaningful personal contact outside our bubbles for the first time.
Director general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield says “elbow bumps” still offer the best protection but it seems a quick hug, handshake or hongi — certainly between close friends and family — is likely to be okay. So too are social gatherings — of up to 100 people indoors and outdoors.
Those two things will allow friends and families to connect once again, to celebrate significant events, and also to gather for vital support in times of commiseration.
They cannot come soon enough for those who have struggled the most under the strict lockdown conditions.
Being able to get back to many sports and recreation activities will be welcome, for getting active again after our enforced hibernation, and offering further avenues for social connection.
A return to full schooling will be crucial for working parents, and to help provide a sense of normality and routine for children.
Much longer in lockdown and the potential academic, social and psychological scars could become more evident.
Clearing the healthcare and surgery backlog will be likewise vital.
And finally, for those industries and commercial operations that weren’t able to operate fully or at all under level 3, there is the opportunity to open properly for business. Seeing the likes of barbers, hairdressers and beauty salons; cafes, bars and restaurants; and movies and theatres attracting foot traffic (if they can adhere to the health and safety rules required) will be heartening.
Of course for some, particularly in the tourism and aviation sectors, the losses have already been significant and it will be a long, hard road to recovery as long as our borders remain closed and the pandemic continues to ravage the global economy.
The Government faces a critical period. Its bold, swift actions of the past weeks have undoubtedly helped the country dodge the initial Covid-19 bullet, but the economic fallout — and the wider health, social and psychological impacts — will become fully apparent only over the coming months and years.
The Government has been clear it will not risk squandering the health gains made and this is still not “business as usual”. It is waiting out the full two-week incubation period needed at level 3 before health officials can gauge its success and feel confident about signalling the move down a level. It may be phased in, in smaller steps, if necessary. But the recent days with no new cases or new cases in single digits and traced to current clusters, along with ramped up testing and tracing, all point promisingly towards level 2 this next week.
The health risks will remain. It will still be up to New Zealanders to adhere to the hygiene and social distancing rules, lest we stumble backwards.
Many will embrace the giant leap level 2 offers but it is important to remember this crisis has also taken a toll, and some people will emerge more fragile than others. It will be important to go easy on those who are doing it hard.
Some have lost loved ones during lockdown and have not been able to farewell them and grieve according to their customs and practices.
Some have lost their livelihoods and will have little or no income to splash out on the level 2 “treats” others may be able to enjoy.
Some will be trying to escape violent homes; some unsure of the stability of their current accommodation.
And many of us, as much as we may want the closer social contact, may simply find it difficult to engage with others and the world after all the messaging, stories and images of the past months that have entrenched fear and caution.
Courage, compassion and collaboration will be required as we emerge into this brave new world together — whatever the length of our stride.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease

Public interest served by exposure of state failings	The Australian	A full probe of child services in Victoria is warranted and overdue The reaction of state authorities to the publication of damning reports about child deaths in Victoria has again confirmed that secrecy, not children, is too often the main concern of bureaucrats and politicians. An urgent 2am court hearing brought by the state’s Commission for Children and Young People against Nationwide News (publisher of The Australian) and its Victorian editor, Damon Johnston, illustrates the point. The hearing before Supreme Court of Victoria Justice Croucher sought to stop further publication of details from a report detailing the tragic deaths of young people known to state welfare authorities. The state coroner confirmed to Johnston that 65 Victorian children and teenagers known to authorities had died in one year. A confidential report criticises Child Protection for being too slow dealing with six cases, all involving children under two when they died.
In response to Johnston’s articles, the commission sought an injunction restraining Nationwide News from publishing any details from the confidential report. The effect of the injunction would have killed off existing and future reporting on the report. The commission argued it was in the public interest for the report to be suppressed because it was important it do its work in private and because parliament had indicated an intention that this type of material remain confidential.
Counsel for Nationwide News said the reports were an important example of public interest journalism addressing serious government failings and that the court should be very slow to silence public discussion on such issues. The newspaper should be able to continue to discuss the failings of the conduct of the government relating to the safety of children. The identity of the children in the report was not disclosed by the newspaper and the families were not identified. No offence was committed under Section 55 of the Commission for Children and Young People Act as claimed because the secrecy regime in the provisions does not apply to journalists. After a 2½-hour hearing that finished at 4.30am on Tuesday, Justice Croucher did not grant an injunction, instead favouring a negotiated settlement between the parties. As a show of good faith, The Australian agreed not to publish further details from the report, “Child Death Inquiry – Inquiry into services provided to six children known to Child Protection who were less than two years old at the time of their death”, while discussions took place, and to remove details already published regarding one child in the report. As we editorialised on Saturday, Victoria’s child protection services are in crisis, exacerbated by last year’s prolonged COVID-19 lockdowns. Child Protection has focused on monitoring compliance rather than understanding and responding to underlying support needs of parents. These issues are not unique to Victoria. But the experience from other jurisdictions has been that public exposure of failings is essential to examine and improve child welfare agency performance. The Australian is sensitive to the delicate issues surrounding reporting of family issues and those relating to children. But we believe child services departments nationally need more public attention, not less. Serious public interest issues have been brought to light by our reporting of advice given to the Victorian government about shortcomings of its own system. The fact court suppression was the first response is a damning indictment of the Victorian government when it comes to accountability. Far too often a gag on open discussion is sought by authorities to protect themselves from scrutiny, rather than working to better protect minors. The issues raised by Johnston, and the authorities’ response, show a full public probe of child services in Victoria is warranted and overdue.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Covid-19 blame game kicks off	Wanganui Chronicle	A game of international political football is under way. The match-up mainly pits the United States Government, caught flat-footed in the pandemic and trying to pin blame on China, where Covid-19 emerged.
President Donald Trump, who refuses to shoulder any responsibility himself, thinks Beijing should. “It could have been stopped in China before it started, and it wasn’t.”
US criticism of Beijing’s secretive, authoritarian system is shared by two of the hardest-hit countries, Britain and France.
Trump’s presidential campaign is running ads on the blame-China theme. The New York Times reports that the Republican Party sees it as an election strategy. US officials have talked up a theory that the virus escaped a lab in Wuhan, although scientific analysis has pointed to wildlife being the source.
Trump accused the World Health Organisation of being “China-centric” as he cut US funding to the agency.
The WHO issued its first warning about the mystery virus in the first week of January. On January 14 a WHO official told reporters there was “the possibility of human-to-human transmission” and “ the possibility of super-spreading events”.
Last week, AP reported that between January 14 and 19, top Chinese officials knew they were facing a pandemic. President Xi Jinping warned the public on January 20 but by then, AP reported, “more than 3000 people had been infected during almost a week of public silence”.
In China, health workers and local officials are not allowed to release information on a disease emergency before the Ministry of Health, the ABC reports.
Can China’s actions be blamed for the damage caused in some countries or were there enough warnings and time to limit the fallout? Variations in outcomes appear to relate to how quickly and decisively countries reacted.
The Sars animal virus epidemic of 2002-03 originated in China and affected 26 countries. This time, even as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea quickly took protective action in January, nations farther afield failed to bolster their defences. An ability to manufacture protective health equipment in an emergency will surely be part of future national pandemic plans.
There’s little doubt that Chinese authorities were less transparent than they could have been, dithered early on as crowds still congregated, and have not fully accounted for all virus victims.
However, those charges can also be levelled at other countries. For instance, Trump said that China must have the most deaths from the virus of any country despite its official figures.
A clearer picture will emerge when data allows a comparison of this year’s figures with mortality averages. — NZ Herald	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Youth welfare demands clarity	The Australian	A gender clinic inquiry serves everyone, including trans kids
The coronavirus pandemic has been an all-consuming challenge, but other health issues also require vigilance. Earlier this month federal Health Minister Greg Hunt revived debate about medical treatments at children’s hospital gender clinics. Mr Hunt is right that this issue demands careful attention because it involves vulnerable minors. Unfortunately, his intervention has sown confusion. He has ruled out a national inquiry but would not explain why when asked by The Australian, and so the government’s position is unclear. This is a global debate, with official reviews and landmark litigation overseas, and it is not going away.
Cautious advocates for these “affirmative” medical treatments admit the supporting evidence is short-term and low quality at best. That is why this newspaper has reported professional concerns — and calls for an inquiry — since August last year. There has been a surge in teenagers, many mentally ill or with autism, wanting irreversible changes to the body that they may regret. Everyone is entitled to better information about these treatments and rival, less invasive responses such as psychotherapy. This is true not only for families wary of gender clinics but also for those who see them as saviours. Parents and clinicians wanting the best care for young people can disagree profoundly about this complex issue.
In August last year, Mr Hunt gave the job of vetting these trans youth treatments to a medical college that immediately protested it did not do inquiries. This newspaper’s reporting revealed the college had joined gender clinics in lobbying to extend these treatments with more public money and less judicial oversight. Last month, the college admitted to Mr Hunt there was only patchy evidence for these treatments, which include powerful hormone drugs and surgery. Yet the college focused not on the harm that might be done by the treatments but on the “further harm” that an inquiry supposedly would do to suicide-prone trans kids. The source of this harm, according to the college, is media and public interest. In a debate that ought to turn on evidence, the college failed to back up this claim, which clearly was targeted at the activist caricature of The Australian’s coverage. This was a worrying sign in a fraught issue marked by years of mostly uncritical pro-trans media coverage and often opaque policymaking involving lobby groups.
For seven months, in the face of questions from this newspaper, Mr Hunt had kept silent on the call for a broad parliamentary inquiry from a petition of 200-plus doctors. Then, 10 days ago, The Age quoted him saying he opposed an inquiry and repeating the college’s “further harm” warning. His stance on this important question of public policy remains unclear, despite our requests for clarification.The precise nature of an inquiry is open to debate but what’s vital is rigorous scrutiny of evidence with respect for all involved and no more smearing of informed critics as bigots. The Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne, home to Australia’s biggest gender clinic, claims our coverage is “inflammatory”. The articles are available for anyone who wants to test that claim, but where are RCH’s answers to multiple questions about medical ethics and evidence? The hospital pleads a “dignified silence” but does not disclose it refused requests for interviews with clinicians and detailed data before this newspaper published its first report last August. Every gender clinic in Australia knew that sooner or later local media would pick up the global medical debate raging overseas.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Prime Minister has time to reset and take control	The Australian	A new parliamentary year carries opportunities and risks
Although Scott Morrison has had a wicked summer he’d rather forget, it’s an experience he must learn from if he is to successfully reset his political and policy fortunes. The Prime Minister’s reputation as a skilled communicator, decisive leader and cheery man of the people has been battered. On Monday we reported the Coalition had taken an electoral hit from the bushfire crisis and the sports rorts controversy, with Mr Morrison’s popularity languishing in a post-Hawaii trough. Newspoll shows the Coalition’s primary vote tumbling to 38 per cent, from 42 per cent in early December. A new parliamentary year offers the Coalition a chance to break out of its rut and seize the moment.
The loss of political skin has largely been of Mr Morrison’s own making, given his dominance of the government’s sales pitch and decision-making. The government lost its way in three areas — bushfires, sports rorts and to an extent the coronavirus response — for different reasons. Mr Morrison’s pre-Christmas family vacation to Hawaii was a misstep with voters and poorly handled, end to end. The trip allowed critics to portray the Prime Minister as uncaring and missing in action as the bushfires crisis deepened. Certainly the obfuscation around Mr Morrison’s absence overseas was a mistake when the public needed clarity and reassurance. A chance to assert leadership was forfeited. Was there a touch of hubris after a triumphant year against expectations? Whether voters hold on to the gaffes and forget the good moves made hinges on what Mr Morrison does next. Since his return six weeks ago, Mr Morrison has been front and centre in the national media. He has held press conferences on every issue facing his government, visited bushfire zones and drought-affected areas, and kept up a stream of policy announcements. Yet critics have had a field day and Mr Morrison has been playing rhetorical catch-up. After the scathing Auditor-General’s report into the $100m Community Sport Infrastructure Program, the government was utterly immobilised, defending and dodging an episode of blatant pork barrelling. The principles were clear but, rather than confronting the breach and being open, Mr Morrison set in train an artificial process. Not releasing the report by Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary Phil Gaetjens only serves to raise more questions on a topic that should have put laid to rest a fortnight ago.
The response to the coronavirus also has been questionable. The government seems to have been, at best, a day behind the play. Precise details about the fast-moving international health crisis have been slow in coming, such is the tight central control by Beijing. But the confusion over who would bear the $1000 cost for the transfer of evacuees to Christmas Island — finally cleared up by Josh Frydenberg — is a sign of an inexplicable lack of co-ordination.
The government’s responses to these issues are mystifying, highlighting shortcomings in decision-making and transparency. Thinking back, for instance, to the way Labor handled the immediate response to the liquidity and spending infarction due to the global financial crisis in 2008 is sobering. Labor took quick action and used clear lines of communication. The subsequent waste and over-stimulus is a sorry story. But this government needs to get its crisis management in order. As parliament returns, the triumphant Coalition of 2019 is somehow in internal disarray. The Nationals have a chance to cauterise their bleeding due to the self-immolation of Bridget McKenzie. It is not clear what benefit a return to Barnaby Joyce as leader would bring but muddling along with a nice-guy leader who fails to cut through is also fraught.Mr Morrison cannot control his coalition partner, but he can reset his government’s fortunes. At the National Press Club last Wednesday the Prime Minister laid out an agenda, pledging to stay the course on delivering a strong economy, job growth, better services, practical ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhanced national security. The workbook is big enough, as long as it has at the forefront ambitions to make structural renovations for the long term — on taxation, retirement incomes, energy policy and red tape — rather than ad hoc moves that pander to the whims of the noisiest Australians. It is apparent Mr Morrison has lost some of his abundant confidence. He can be stubborn, which is both a virtue and a vice. He is also clearly a confidence player. He should channel those virtues. First, ignore the roving mob of post-fact social media whiners who change the policy menu daily. Second, concentrate on what he promised voters he would deliver: a budget surplus, no tax rises, best-practice social services, work skills, fresh investment and congestion-busting infrastructure. There’s a lot to do. The surplus may not eventuate because of the coronavirus-linked hit to tourism and education. If the economy tanks, the government’s budget is essentially in balance so a sensible and targeted fiscal hit could be justified. The government’s wobbles are not terminal. The nation’s fundamentals are sound. An election is at least two years away. Mr Morrison is a relatively new leader with good instincts. His ministers need to step up because he is carrying them; that may have worked in the sprint to the election, not now. The public demands two things: competence and honesty. Mr Morrison should keep that front of mind as he surveys the many opportunities and risks that come with leadership and incumbent power.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
ABC staff told to mince words	The Australian	A pedophile, defined by the Macquarie Dictionary, is “an adult who engages in sexual activities with children’’. The public understands the term — it could not be clearer. Unless you are a senior news producer at the national broadcaster in Tasmania. As Matthew Denholm wrote on Saturday, ABC reporters in the state have been told to avoid referring to child sex abusers as pedophiles, including those who serially abused children for many years.
“We should avoid it, unless we know he had a clinical diagnosis of pedophilia and instead use serial sexual offender / predator, or a sexual abuser of children and young people,” the senior producer’s email said in bold-face. ABC staff who do not want to pander to pedophiles are angry and concerned, understandably. So why use several words or a convoluted phrase such as “sexual abuser of children and young people’’ instead of a single, accurate word? The edict followed a discussion between a reporter and a local Sexual Assault Support Service about alleged pedophile nurse James (Jim) Geoffrey Griffin, who killed himself in October 2019. He was facing multiple charges relating to child sex abuse and producing child exploitation material.
“SASS says … there are a lot of pedophiles / people with pedophilia who do not act on those impulses, ­especially if they reach out for and receive professional psychological help … describing (perhaps technically inaccurately) Griffin as a pedophile could ­discourage those people from seeking help, making it more ­likely that they go on to abuse children,” the email said. The producer should be telling staff to use tight, accurate wording, not weasel words.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
The law can make mistakes	The Australian	A petition by leading scientists has pleaded a mother’s innocence A campaign by some of the nation’s top scientists to right what they say is a grave injustice against a woman accused of murdering her four infant children is too powerful to ignore. The case against Kathleen Folbigg, who is serving a 30-year jail term, has echoes of the Lindy Chamberlain affair in which a disbelieving public and legal process refused to accept the possibility a dingo had taken her baby. The 90 scientists who have signed the petition calling for Folbigg to be pardoned claim a serious miscarriage of justice has taken place. If they are correct, the suffering endured by a woman who has lost four children to sudden infant death syndrome and natural causes and has been wrongly sent to prison for their murder is almost beyond comprehension.
Eminent researchers who have signed the petition include two Nobel laureates and several Australians of the year. Among them is Australian Academy of Science president John Shine, Nobel laureate Peter Doherty, and Ian Frazer, co-inventor of the vaccine that prevents cervical cancer. They say new medical evidence about a mutant gene carried by two of the Folbigg children creates a “strong presumption” that they died from natural causes.
The case against Folbigg was circumstantial, with no forensic evidence she had smothered any of her children, let alone all four. Following Folbigg’s 2003 trial, the Victorian Clinical Genetics Service sequenced entire genomes from neonatal heel-prick blood cards that were more than 20 years old. It found a novel, never before reported mutation in two infants that had been inherited from the mother. The variant can cause sudden cardiac death.
The evidence was not sufficient to sway a 2019 inquiry into Folbigg’s conviction but the scientists say the hearings did not include a single expert in the genetics of cardiac arrhythmias. Nor was there an expert in calmodulin, the gene at the centre of the evidence challenging two of the deaths. Folbigg was convicted on the basis of ambiguous entries in her private diaries that the jury was told amounted to confessions of guilt, something she denied. The scientists argue the inquiry’s findings run “counter to the scientific and medical evidence that now exists”. New evidence and the strong support of top scientists demand that Folbigg’s case be reconsidered. The law can make mistakes. When new facts come to light they must properly be taken into account. Beyond reasonable doubt seems difficult to sustain in a case where scientific evidence suggesting innocence is pitted against a circumstantial case that rests on disputed entries in a personal diary.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Don’t push panic button, economy is not in toilet	The Australian	A poorly designed fiscal stimulus risks recession or waste
The good news, declares Scott Morrison, is Kimberly-Clark, which produces toilet paper, has opened up its factory line in South Australia. The nation’s panicky shoppers should be relieved. “That’s the economy in motion,” the Prime Minister said on Tuesday ahead of the Reserve Bank’s last-gasp cash rate cut brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. The Bureau of Statistics reported on Wednesday gross domestic product expanded in the December quarter before the worst of the Black Summer bushfires hit. The economy ambled along last year at a regular clip of 0.5 to 0.6 per cent a quarter, posting annual growth of 2.2 per cent. That’s hardly news to scream happy about but Josh Frydenberg says he’d take that any day given it’s just below US growth of 2.3 per cent and well ahead of other rich countries.
Looking in the rear-view mirror gives us a sense of which parts of the economy are pulling their weight and which areas are struggling. Across the year, GDP growth has been driven by the trade sector, especially mining, and public spending on social welfare, health, disability services and capital works. Job growth has been a tad under 2 per cent across the economy. Drought has slammed agriculture, but there are pockets of revival. Consumer spending, particularly on big-ticket items such as new cars, has been weak. Sales promotions ahead of Christmas, however, breathed some life into the retail industry.
But the world has given us a pay cut, with the price for our exports slipping back, while the cost of imports — such as computers, fuels, overseas holidays and heavy machinery — has risen off the back of a weaker dollar. GDP per capita, a proxy for living standards, grew last year by a measly 0.7 per cent, well below long-term averages. Profits fell in the December quarter. As we have bemoaned for some time, private investment is extremely weak, with construction and equipment spending falling during the course of last year. That bodes ill for productivity and our ability to sustain faster rates of growth down the track. Home building is in a deep hole but trade in second-hand housing assets has kicked up again, with transfer duties flooding into state treasuries. It’s hard to see where the central bank’s “gentle turning point” has been living, although the statistician has revised up GDP for previous quarters.
There is abundant stimulus flowing in the economy. But the RBA’s three cash rate cuts last year, as well as the Treasurer’s tax cuts for low and middle-income earners, saw households paying down debt or saving for a rainy day. Perhaps it has brought forward the time when consumers begin to spend and businesses start to invest. The evolving COVID-19 health crisis, however, has the potential to derail a slow-moving engine. The RBA says it is difficult to predict how large and long-lasting the economic effect will be; its 0.5 per cent cash rate is aimed at providing extra support to jobs and economic activity. But monetary policy has run its race and ultra-cheap money may simply set off another run of house-price mania. So Canberra is coming to the rescue.
Managing sentiment is art rather than science. The Prime Minister is taking the lead in calming nerves and preparing to unleash the fiscal hounds. Given this is a health shock, with severe supply-side consequences likely, the 2008-09 game plan to deal with the global financial crisis won’t cut it. Mr Morrison has made clear the initial response will be “targeted” and “scalable”; but the heft of the package has been upgraded from “modest” to “measured” in a sign both ambition and need are growing by the day. The risk is the Coalition — which mocks Labor’s GFC overkill on pinks batts, school halls and cheques to dead people — will underspend and the economy slips into recession. It’s likely the “back in the black” surplus is gone, but Mr Morrison wants to get “back on track”, fiscally speaking, as soon as possible.
In talking up the national accounts on Wednesday, the Treasurer said he was looking at changes to deeming rates for retirees struggling with ultra-low interest rates. Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack called on the states to propose construction projects that were ready to roll. But the government has brought forward $4bn in work already. Do we have the skills and materials capacity for it, given the bushfires recovery work? Probably not. The essence of the coming stimulus will be to protect jobs, boost investment and help companies with their cashflow.Business, which accepts company tax relief is not on the horizon, had been pushing for an investment allowance well before the virus crisis. A tax break is likely to figure in the package, which Mr Morrison promises will be delivered “well before” the May budget. With any plan hinging on scalability, we expect the fiscal response will come sooner rather than later. A temporary tax holiday for the worst-affected traders in tourism, education, farming and retail would provide valuable relief, as would a delay for small enterprises to lodge Business Activity Statements. Getting the stimulus design right — avoiding the extremes of recession and spending waste — will test officials and their political masters. Even though time is of the essence, pushing the panic button would send the wrong public signal.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
US isolationism carries risks	The Australian	A pragmatic Middle East policy is important to the West
Amid fears that Libya is close to becoming another Syria, with all that would entail in human suffering and migrants fleeing to Europe, Western nations have good reason to exert leadership to step in to help end the civil war. On Saturday, forces loyal to Libyan military strongman Khalifa Haftar blocked oil exports from the country’s main ports, raising the stakes at the Berlin summit aimed at bringing peace to the North African nation.
The move to cripple the country’s main income source was a protest against Turkey’s decision to send troops to shore up Field Marshal Haftar’s rival, the head of Tripoli’s UN-recognised government, Fayez al-Sarraj. Vladimir Putin has dispatched hundreds of mercenaries to help Marshal Haftar, who controls most of the country including its oilfields.
While European nations and the US attended the summit, their reluctance to get involved in another Middle East conflict is understandable. The US also is focused increasingly on the Indo-Pacific region. In a feature written for The Wall Street Journal and published in The Australian on Monday, Sydney-educated Martin Indyk, who was the Clinton administration’s Israel ambassador and who served as a special Middle East envoy for the Obama administration, argues: “Americans remain war-weary … we seem incapable of mustering a consensus or pursuing a consistent policy in the Middle East.” Evidence of this is most clear in Syria, where Washington’s reluctance to get involved beyond defeating Islamic State has played into the Soviet-era strategic ambitions of Russia, as well as those of Iran and Turkey. Middle East oil, as Mr Indyk argues, is no longer crucial to the US. And while supporting Israel’s security is in US interests, the survival of the Jewish state is no longer in doubt: “It is today’s nuclear-armed Israel that has the means to crush Iran, not the other way around … Israel enjoys stronger strategic relations with the leading Sunni Arab states — Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others — than they maintain with one another.” For all that, Mr Indyk concedes that “we cannot afford to turn our backs on the Middle East”. The US, he says, needs “a sustainable Middle East strategy based on a more realistic assessment of our interests”. President Hassan Rouhani’s boast on Thursday last week that Iran had begun enriching uranium faster than it did before the 2015 nuclear deal demonstrated why leaving the Middle East to Mr Putin, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and their Iranian allies is not the answer.At least for now, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran’s claim is mainly hyperbole. Donald Trump, while keen to scale down US involvement in the Middle East, recognised the need for involvement with his deadly strike against General Qassem Soleimani on January 3.

Rains stir familiar lament on lack of preparation	The Australian	A precious resource is wasted as floodwater flows freely out to sea
A return of flooding rains that have inundated towns and homes along the east coast of Australia demonstrates how poor planning can exacerbate the dangers and squander the opportunities that natural events can bring. Bad design, inadequate infrastructure and unchecked urban expansion increase the cost of disasters. A lack of foresight to prepare for events that occur on a regular if not totally predictable basis means that precious resources go to waste. It is a reasonable lament that when big rains come, billions of litres of water are left to flow out to sea, often causing great damage along the way. Too little effort is made to harvest floodwater for use at a later date. The quality of public infrastructure built in flood-prone regions often is not sufficient for the task. As Floodplain Management Australia president Ian Dinham writes on Tuesday, the current flooding in the Hawkesbury-Nepean area in western Sydney is not unexpected as various studies and reports have highlighted the extreme flood risks since the 1990s.
Nonetheless, the people of the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley will be left with the heartache and repairs when the television cameras and politicians move on as the threat from the latest flooding episode subsides. Thousands of households, businesses and livelihoods are at unnecessary risk because development has been allowed in areas known to flood. In the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley there are 5000 houses built below the one-in-100-year flood level and a further 7000 below the one-in-500-year flood level. Current flooding is estimated to be a one-in-50-year event in Sydney and a one-in-100-year event on the NSW mid-north coast. Flooding has been severe enough to spark the evacuation of more than 18,000 people and for 38 areas of the state to be declared disaster zones.
Before the floodwater had peaked, debate started about NSW government plans to allow about 134,000 more people to settle in Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley flood plain by 2050. This development is contingent on a plan to raise the Warragamba Dam wall to transform the dam from water storage only to flood mitigation as well. A report by Infrastructure NSW says the raised wall would mitigate floods by creating “airspace” in a dedicated flood mitigation zone around 14m above the current full water supply level. The flood mitigation zone behind the wall would be used to capture and temporarily hold back floodwater coming from the large Warragamba catchment. After the flood peak, floodwater would be released in a controlled way, reducing flood levels downstream and alleviating potentially devastating impacts on communities. The mitigation zone would be used only during floods. The current water supply level would not change. Engineering estimates are that increasing the dam wall would mitigate nearly 100 per cent of the risk to homes from the most serious floods estimated to happen once in 200 years.
Questions are being asked about why more water was not released from Warragamba Dam in anticipation of the most recent rains. The answer in NSW is that Warragamba Dam was not designed or approved to operate as a flood mitigation dam. Pre-releasing water ahead of a predicted flood inflow would have limited effectiveness, with minor benefits for small floods and none for larger floods. Lowering the dam wall by 5m would have limited benefits for larger floods and lowering the wall by 12m would provide moderate flood mitigation but have a significant impact on water security for Greater Sydney. Opponents of the plan to raise the dam wall are concerned about the impact it would have on some areas of the World Heritage-listed Blue Mountains National Park. They say raising the wall would not prevent flooding from smaller rivers and creeks below the dam. One option is to remove houses already located in the flood zone and return the draining system to its original state. Another is to trust that the calculated flood mitigation benefits of raising the dam wall make it a preferable option for existing houses as well as offering the potential to ease development congestion pressures in Australia’s biggest city. Whatever that decision may be, there is a demonstrated need to improve the quality and durability of urban and rural infrastructure to cope with the impacts of heavy weather. One recommendation of the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements was to establish a standing entity that would enhance national natural disaster resilience and recovery, focused on long-term disaster risk reduction. Scott Morrison announced in November last year that the new agency initially would incorporate the functions of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, established in response to the 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires, and would integrate the functions of the National Drought and North Queensland Flood Response and Recovery Agency, and the disaster recovery and risk reduction functions within the Department of Home Affairs. Disasters aside, efforts must be focused on building infrastructure that can withstand harsh conditions and harvest the abundance of water during periods of heavy rain and flood so it can be used when conditions inevitably turn to drought.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Revival road to a dynamic, more productive Australia	The Australian	A rare chance to reinvent engine of growth and prosperity
This week Mervyn King, one of the world’s leading economists and governor of the Bank of England during the global financial crisis, declared that governments were “doing enormous damage” by freezing their economies through lockdowns to suppress the spread of coronavirus. “This is necessary in the short run but we need to plan an exit route sooner rather than later,” Lord King, who now sits in the House of Lords, told economics editor Adam Creighton in an interview. Using words such as recession and depression to describe the sharp downturn this year was “unhelpful”, Lord King noted, because it was a “government-mandated shutdown … it isn’t resulting from decisions by the private sector”. This was a policy-induced economic catastrophe to control COVID-19 infection rates; the longer it lasted, the more harm it would do to the mental wellbeing of those generations whose income, job security and prospects had been disrupted, he said.
The destruction from putting our economy in suspended animation became clear on Tuesday when the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the shedding of 780,000 jobs in the three weeks to April 4, with one in four workers in the accommodation and food services industry losing employment. The ABS payroll figures show younger people have been hit particularly hard, with almost one in 10 of those under the age of 30 losing jobs. Not surprisingly, after the enforced shutdown of non-essential businesses late last month, huge job losses occurred in arts and recreation, but also in mining, real estate and professional services. Scott Morrison has revealed how income support machinery has swung into action. Since March 16, after a boost to payments, the government has processed 517,000 JobSeeker claims. By the end of the week Centrelink will have handled as many claims for payments in six weeks as it normally would in a year.
However it is designated, the coming economic calamity is expected to be a once-in-a-century contraction, according to Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe. In a speech on Tuesday, Dr Lowe said gross domestic product would fall by 10 per cent over the first half of this year, with the bulk of the decline in the June quarter. He warned the crisis would lead to a “staggering” 20 per cent plunge in the total hours worked by Australians in the first six months of the year, with the jobless rate reaching 10 per cent. As is his way, Dr Lowe said he was encouraged by the Prime Minister’s comments, a few hours before his own speech, that we had reached a “turning point” in the fight against COVID-19 and that the nation was on the “road to recovery”.
We often hear the political adage “never waste a crisis”; well, Australia can’t afford to botch the recovery. Before the pandemic hit, the nation was listless, meandering at sub-2 per cent GDP growth, with insipid business investment, and public spending and migration driving activity. Productivity went backwards; we were bludging, to put in bluntly, but the world was giving us a pay rise via solid export prices. Dr Lowe now sees a scenario where we could expect the economy to begin its bounce back in the September quarter, then to pick up strength: “If this is how things play out, the economy could be expected to grow very strongly next year, with GDP growth of perhaps 6-7 per cent, after a fall of around 6 per cent this year.” Companies are now learning, painfully, how much fat they’ve built into operations. Naturally, there will be a productivity surge in the upswing, as leaner businesses get more from their capital and labour. But across the economy’s supply side we need to do much better: work smarter, be flexible and become more competitive, rather than rely on a weak dollar to do so. Dr Lowe even dusted off his policy reform playlist. These are classic tracks, but the Morrison government may finally be tapping its feet as well as listening to the hits. The RBA chief said the reform task was to make Australia a great place to invest, where businesses could expand, innovate and hire people. All the thinking had been done, he added, riffing on five reform priorities: the way we tax income, consumption and land; how we build and price infrastructure; the way we train our workforce; the regulations that promote or hinder expansion; and the flexibility and complexity of our industrial relations.Mr Morrison acknowledges his economic brains trust has advised that to get the economy back on track “any sense of business as usual when it comes to the policy frameworks that we had prior to the election will need to be reconsidered”. If he is to build on his assured crisis stewardship and take voters on the path to higher living standards, the Prime Minister will need a revival plan that includes difficult and disruptive reforms. At the very least, we’ll need a more dynamic business sector, one that is not held back by ancient workplace rules, pointless regulation, uncompetitive tax imposts and government crowding out for capital. We will be carrying extra weight, in debt and deficits, for years. But we also have a rare chance as a nation to reinvent our world-beating engine for growth and prosperity.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
We were warned on aged care	The Australian	A rationale of lockdown was to protect the sick and elderly Victoria starts this week with almost 700 active cases of COVID-19 linked to staff and residents in aged care. State Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton has pointed out what we already knew: that Europe’s experience showed rapid spread of the virus and high mortality in aged-care facilities. These were deaths in circumstances of great suffering and emotional pain, including for extended families, with infection risk denying a proper farewell. Amid the rapidly shifting uncertainties of the pandemic, this serious risk to unwell and often lonely old people in institutions has been widely understood for months. On Saturday, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt announced a new multi-agency Victorian Aged Care Response Centre. Is this a hurried corrective following a sustained failure to take effective preventive measures not only by both levels of government but by the aged-care sector? That’s the question, and Scott Morrison’s response on Monday — “we’ve been taking action on this for weeks now, for weeks and weeks” — sounds confident but lacks convincing detail.
A central justification for the eye-watering cost, job losses and social pain of shutting down the economy and restricting movement was to protect elderly and chronically ill residents in aged care and to suppress community transmission more widely so as to reduce the risk of asymptomatic staff turning up for work in those facilities. To what degree have these sacrifices been wasted through the failure of those responsible in government, regulatory bodies and industry to seize the opportunity of lockdown to fortify aged care against the risk they so rightly and repeatedly broadcast to the community?
The full answer is not yet clear and requires more detailed news reporting under difficult conditions of garbled information and official platitudes. One key question is how much was learned from April’s virus outbreak at Newmarch House in western Sydney that led to 19 deaths. The response following the first infection reportedly was slow and inadequate, and it’s obvious infection control was not successful. Anglicare Sydney, which was in charge, waited six days before taking up a federal offer of fresh staff from a private company. Things reached a point where the regulator had to threaten to take away the facility’s licence to operate before there was decisive action.
Now, three months deeper into the pandemic, commonwealth teams have stepped in to try to control Victoria’s worst aged-care outbreak at St Basil’s in Melbourne, which is linked to more than 80 infections. It took until the middle of this month for the federal and Victorian governments to announce measures to reduce cross-infection between facilities by limiting staff to shifts at a single aged-care facility. It’s up to politicians and industry leaders to rebut the presumption they had not put in a serious enough effort to prepare for this long foreseen risk to the elderly.
Nobody is saying the job would have been easy. Although some visa restrictions have been relaxed, skilled staff were difficult to find even before the pandemic. Governments have not lived up to promises of more personal protective equipment for staff, according to industry figures. Access to testing and hospital admission arrangements have been inconsistent. The aged-care component of the commonwealth’s $289bn COVID response is $743m, with much of it opaque funding for bureaucracy. In the thick of the immediate crisis, some commentators have spun an opportunistic narrative that COVID-19 is simply the latest proof that the profit motive is the true disease in aged care, and one curable only by a multibillion-dollar public buyout of the sector. There’s no doubt aged care has shortcomings and needs reform. This is a global problem, especially in affluent ageing nations, and goes well beyond the funding model to psychological and cultural dilemmas. But these are complex questions for a post-pandemic future. And everyone knew the nature and state of aged care when we went into lockdown. It was the duty of all involved to take that flawed reality into account when doing their utmost to COVID-proof the sector. Will the record show this was done diligently enough? That is the question.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Beijing tests US in South China Sea	The Australian	A second stage of aggression around the Spratly Islands is under way Anger in The Philippines over China’s deployment of hundreds of maritime militia ships masquerading as fishing boats, which violates the country’s territorial integrity in defiance of international law, is well justified. So is Washington’s dispatch of the US 7th Fleet’s powerful USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group to the South China Sea amid rising tensions over the aggressive new attempt by Beijing to assert ownership over territory that does not belong to it. The US armada of warships includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill and guided-missile destroyer USS Russell.
As Amanda Hodge has reported, tensions between The Philippines and China are broiling over the presence of what was at its peak a flotilla of 220 Chinese maritime militia ships deep inside Philippine territorial waters, 300km off the mainland. The ships have been anchored close to the strategic Whitsun Reef in the South China Sea’s disputed Spratly Islands. As it entrenches itself around Whitsun Reef, China has claimed the flotilla consists of fishing boats innocently sheltering from bad weather. But though their numbers have been reduced, most of the maritime militia ships have been there for several weeks. The weather has been fine. And analysis by the US Naval War College has found “no evidence of fishing whatsoever, but every indication of trolling for territorial claims”.
Philippine Defence Minister Delfin Lorenzana has accused China of seeking “to occupy land forms inside Philippine waters”: “The continued presence of Chinese maritime militias in the area reveals their intent to further occupy (areas belonging to The Philippines). They have done this before,” he said, referring to Scarborough Shoal and Mischief Reef, which were seized by China in 2012 and 1995 in similar operations. Reports that “illegally constructed structures” have been sighted on what are known as the Union Banks, a group of reefs in the Spratlys, have added to fury in The Philippines. These are assumed to be another sign of China digging in.
To its credit, the Biden administration has been quick to pledge strong support for The Philippines in the stand-off. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has strongly reaffirmed “the applicability of the US-Philippines Mutual Defence Treaty” to the South China Sea and tensions surrounding Whitsun Reef. He is right to have done so. China’s lawless attempts to intimidate The Philippines and colonise more territory in the South China Sea, through which more than a third of the world’s trade passes, is a test for the Biden administration’s declared determination to stand up to Chinese bullying. The challenge must be met.
For more than a decade China has moved aggressively to establish dominance in waters surrounding The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan, building military installations and harassing and bullying other nations. Its aggression against The Philippines is the latest manifestation of Beijing’s disregard for a rules-based world order and the 2016 rejection by a UN arbitral tribunal of its claims to 90 per cent of the South China Sea.
All nations that rely on the right to freedom of navigation through the South China Sea must support The Philippines in its stand-off. China must not be allowed to get away with what is, in effect, a further stage in its drive to dominate the waterways of Southeast Asia. That objective, if it was achieved, would put China in an even stronger position to make good on its threats to overrun democratic Taiwan. Confronting China will require close collaboration involving the Quad nations (the US, Japan, Australia and India) and Southeast Asian nations whose sovereignty has been threatened or usurped by China’s unrelenting maritime aggression. President Joe Biden carries a heavy responsibility in dealing with Beijing’s aggression against The Philippines. China will be watching closely to see how he responds. A re-run of the Obama and Trump years, with tough talking but no more than warships cruising past disputed islands, is unlikely to deter China from its present aggressive course.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Asia-Pacific allies close ranks to secure the region	The Australian	A strategic plan is vital in the face of Chinese aggression After an absence of 13 years, Australia’s return to the annual Malabar naval exercise is significant and welcome. The exercise has assumed crucial importance for the security of the Indo-Pacific region at a time of unrelenting Chinese belligerence. Announcing Australia’s participation alongside fellow members of the Quad alliance, India, Japan and the US, in next month’s exercise in the Indian Ocean, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said Malabar 2020 would “showcase the deep trust that exists among the four major Indo-Pacific democracies and their will to work together on common security interests”.
Senator Reynolds avoided mentioning China by name but she left no doubt Beijing was uppermost in the minds of all the Quad nations’ leaders when she emphasised that Malabar, the region’s premier annual combined naval manoeuvre, would demonstrate “our collective resolve to support an open and prosperous Indo-Pacific”.
Beijing responded with restraint to the announcement, with a foreign affairs spokesman stating they had taken note of the development. “We always believe that military co-operation between countries should be conducive to regional peace and stability,” the spokesman said.
Earlier this month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi denounced the Quad as part of Washington’s strategic plan to build an “Indo-Pacific NATO”. The alliance was the product of a “Cold War mentality” aimed at “stirring up geopolitical competition”, he said. Beijing’s Global Times lambasted India for inviting Australia. Doing so, it said, was a sign New Delhi was trying to “expand its sphere of influence into the entire Indian Ocean and South Pacific”.
Beijing will surely recognise the powerful coalition of the four major Indo-Pacific democracies joining forces to sharpen and fine-tune their navies at a time of increasing Chinese aggression.
In recent years, governments in New Delhi have been skittish about inviting Australia back. They were nervous about provoking further Chinese aggression against India in the Himalayas, already a tinderbox.
But such reservations have now been superseded by strategic imperatives. In June, the People’s Liberation Army killed 20 Indian soldiers on the contested border, heightening New Delhi’s strategic anxiety about the rising super power on its eastern front.
The joint announcement by Senator Reynolds and Japanese Defence Minister Kishi Nobuo of closer bilateral military co-operation is also important. Declaring their “strong opposition” to “coercive unilateral actions” in the South and East China seas, they vowed to undertake bilateral and multilateral freedom-of-navigation operations “to maintain a free and open, secure, inclusive and prosperous region”. In strengthening bilateral military co-operation, Japan pledged that its Self-Defence Forces would “protect Australian Defence Force assets” if they came under threat. The two countries will enhance military interoperability through military exercises and joint operations. .	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Guard against march of Big Brother in virus crisis	The Australian	A temporary loss of liberties can quickly become permanent
As most of us find every day, Australians are working to a whole new set of rules, as Scott Morrison noted on Monday. The actions of government, the Prime Minister said, need to be well considered, well tempered, targeted and effective. They also must be “clear in their purpose and they must be efficient in their execution. It is never the time for rash and ill-conceived decisions”. Caution, fairness and good judgment are essential, especially in relation to the loss of basic freedoms as the states, in different ways, have toughened restrictions on what citizens may and may not do, where they are allowed to go, and with whom.
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has taken on a mammoth challenge in taking charge of the response to the pandemic in our largest state. Earlier mistakes, unfortunately, by NSW authorities in relation to the Ruby Princess cruise ship and by the thoughtless crowd on Bondi Beach 11 days ago have contributed to the caseload in NSW exceeding 2000. Mr Fuller is doing the job well. But he set alarm bells ringing when asked if people could drive to their own holiday homes at the coast. “No,” he said. “And if you do that, and you’ve done that, that’s where you’re staying.” Really? People with holiday homes in driving distance of their main residences were gobsmacked by the idea of being barred from driving between their own properties while still obeying the rules for isolating themselves from the community. That is why those with homes on both sides of the NSW-Queensland border at the southern end of the Gold Coast bristled at Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk closing the border and posting police on guard duty. Often, the tone and the language are as important as the message. Mr Fuller explained his reasoning on Tuesday when he said if too many Sydneysiders shifted to the south or north coast and the virus spread, local health systems were not designed to manage such an influx. The argument makes sense, although common sense on the part of property owners would avoid most problems. Queenslanders, stunned by their state’s clumsy, confusing ban on recreational boating, can see little point in the move when family fishing is still allowed.
Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. And to their credit, most Australians have been compliant with the new rules governing their lives. At the same time the public should be conscious of George Orwell’s observation in Nineteen Eighty-Four that “no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it”. Rather than becoming accustomed to their loss of liberties, governments and citizens need to remind themselves, frequently, that the newly introduced restrictions are temporary. Firm commitments as to their reversal as soon as COVID-19 is no longer a significant threat are vital. The sight of worshippers kneeling outside churches is a reminder that faith communities have complied overwhelmingly with the restrictions, sometimes going beyond what was asked. It will be a while before large gatherings such as sporting events and Sunday services can be resumed. But incremental steps, such as allowing places of worship to be unlocked on quiet weekdays, while insisting on health precautions, should be considered as soon as it is prudent.
Like government officials, retailers, too, should be mindful of when to be firm and when relaxing restrictions is in the public interest. Limitations to prevent panic buying and hoarding groceries and alcohol are helpful. But where plenty of stock of perishable essentials such as milk is available, limiting families, as some supermarkets do, to two containers of fresh milk can be counter-productive. It necessitates shoppers venturing out daily when it would be better if they were home.The curtailing of other freedoms, while less obvious, must also be monitored. The 700-page Biosecurity Act of 2015, we argued last week, has a “whatever-it-takes” clause giving the federal health minister unfettered power to take whatever action they deem necessary once a biosecurity emergency has been declared. It has been in the case of COVID-19. Such provisions, a necessary evil in the modern world, must be used sparingly and never abused. As Mr Morrison said on Monday, it is “our principles and values as Australians” that will guide us through uncharted waters to the other side. Federal and state governments have worked hard to minimise loss of life from this insidious virus. They must also ensure it does not kill our liberties.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
COMMENT Warm, dry homes a win for everyone	Hawkes Bay Today	A warm, dry, healthy, safe home. It is surely a basic desire for most people. In fact, it goes beyond that; it is a fundamental human right, spelled out in domestic legislation, international agreements and conventions to which New Zealand is a signatory, or with which it has agreed to comply.
The crux of them is the right of people to have adequate, affordable, accessible, habitable housing where they can live in security, peace and dignity.
In a country where the quality of life should be good, our old, cold and mouldy homes are a disgrace. More than a third still have winter temperatures below the World Health Organisation’s minimum healthy indoor temperature of 18C, according to Statistics NZ.
For decades it may have been seen as something of a “rite of passage” for hardy students to rent mould-infested, frigid flats for their university years, but the fact they and increasing numbers of families have been living for long periods in substandard rental accommodation, when the health and social effects of doing so are widely known, is inexcusable.
In extreme cases, “housing poverty”, in its various forms and with its various effects, is responsible for harming, sometimes fatally, our most vulnerable — namely children and the elderly, and those in our society often already struggling the most, those with less money, fewer options, and less power and ability to fight for their rights, particularly in a pressured property market.
The rules that came into effect in July last year started to right some of our housing wrongs. Most significantly, they obligated landlords of rental homes to fit ceiling and underfloor insulation “where reasonably practicable” in a bid to markedly improve the health of tenants. Conscious of what the changes would mean for those footing the bill, landlords were given three years’ warning to get their properties up to scratch.
It is a shame then — as revealed by the NZ Herald this week — the Tenancy Tribunal has heard more than 120 cases since July 1 in which landlords failed to insulate rentals or provide accurate insulation statements.
While it is pleasing the plaintiffs have won those cases, landlords fined and tenants compensated, there is still heated debate as to whether that is the tip of the iceberg or a rogue few. It is to be hoped it is the latter.
Tenants need to be protected and should not bear the costs of poor health — costs that in turn are borne by the taxpayer.
There are calls for harsher penalties for landlords — above the $4000 tenants can claim in damages from landlords under the new rules at present. Others say there needs to be a better mechanism by which to check whether landlords are complying with the legislation; the onus should not be on the tenant.
The carrot, not the stick, may be ideal, but without proper follow-up and enforcement, it makes mockery of the rules — and where is the incentive for all those who are complying?
There shouldn’t be resentment over a process that is improving the quality of New Zealand’s homes, for owners and tenants alike; improving people’s quality of life; and reducing the burden on the health system.
It should surely be a win-win.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
COMMENT Comply and it’s a win for everybody	Bay of Plenty Times	A warm, dry, healthy, safe home. It is surely a basic desire for most people.

Landlords, their respective industry bodies, housing advocates and the Government need to continue communicating to ensure the rules are having the desired effect for tenants, work out ways to break down the barriers for those landlords genuinely unable to make the cut, and ensure the system acknowledges the efforts of those who have made the changes. This is particularly vital given another round of Healthy Homes regulations is on the cards for the middle of next year.

Fresh strategy to close the gap	The Australian	Aborigines are entitled to step up and take responsibility
First the good news. The Closing the Gap process, launched by the Rudd government with Coalition support 12 years ago, is on track to have 95 per cent of indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025. The gap in Year 12 attainment is also narrowing, opening up better job and study opportunities. The number of indigenous Australians accessing higher education has more than doubled in a decade, with 20,000 Aborigines attending university, as Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt wrote on Wednesday.
While celebrating the improvements in education, the minister was frank in admitting that progress has been disappointingly slow in other areas. The process has fallen short of its goals on literacy and numeracy, school attendance and employment. The 49 per cent indigenous employment rate compares with 75 per cent for non-indigenous Australians. In 2018, the mortality rate of 141 per 100,000 among indigenous children was twice that of non-indigenous children. Nor is the target to close the life expectancy gap by 2031 on track. In 2015–17, life expectancy at birth for indigenous males was nine years lower than for non-indigenous males, with a similar gap for females.
Responsibility for those failures rests with federal, state and territory governments on all sides during the past 12 years, and in some cases with service providers. Closing the Gap, Scott Morrison said on Wednesday, has been a story of hope, frustration, disappointment, good intentions and good faith. But the results are not good enough. Mr Wyatt, who takes a pragmatic approach to his portfolio, says improving the living standards of indigenous Australians is more important to him than establishing a voice to government or securing constitutional recognition. He is right.Given the failure to make headway on key metrics and in view of the move to create an indigenous voice to government, the reforms to the process proposed by the government are broadly right. A new structure for Closing the Gap is expected by April, with the intention to draw greater input from indigenous Australians and local communities. The Prime Minister envisages a partnership “where we listen, work together and decide together how future policies are developed, especially at a regional and local level”. Replacing “independence with welfare” in trying to help Aborigines was a mistake: “We must restore the right to take responsibility, the right to make decisions, the right to step up, the opportunity to own and create Australians’ own futures. It is what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been saying for a long time.”	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
PM faces a double political problem-solving challenge	The Australian	Absences from cabinet distract from otherwise solid performance Defence Minister Linda Reynolds is doing the sensible thing in following medical advice and extending her sick leave. Accommodations are being made in her absence, as they would in any workplace, and all wish her a swift recovery of health. However, she is a cabinet minister in the eye of a political storm and, while her medical leave is perfectly proper, it has unfortunate and inescapable political consequences.
Obviously, the sexual assault allegations made by Senator Reynolds’ former staffer, Brittany Higgins, must be dealt with independently by the legal system. But the minister’s handling of this incident is bound to be the subject of further hostile questions from Labor and the Greens in the coming parliamentary sitting week. Senator Reynolds will be absent, and she will also miss the scrutiny of Senate estimates. It’s true that a good deal of this interrogation has been weaponised for partisan political purposes but, even so, there are legitimate questions for the minister. Delay may only intensify the pressure upon her return.
She has already been rebuked by Scott Morrison for failing to tell him in a timely manner about the alleged events in her ministerial office out of hours. In her initial round of cross-examination, she had to correct her evidence to the Senate twice. The fact that she referred to Ms Higgins as a “lying cow” when her former staffer went public with the allegations and complaints about a perceived lack of support — as revealed exclusively by this newspaper — has raised additional questions. Senator Reynolds has apologised, both to the staff who heard this inappropriate remark in an open space of her office, and also to Ms Higgins, following a legal letter threatening defamation proceedings. And the minister has made clear she was not commenting on Ms Higgins’ disturbing allegations but on her ex-staffer’s suggestion that she had not been given adequate support.
Even so, this goes beyond a question of temperament and workplace courtesy. The fact this incident leaked invites questions about whether or not there are broader or deeper problems to do with morale and operations in the minister’s office. The Prime Minister’s public characterisation of this explosive, overheard remark by Senator Reynolds as a lapse during a “period which was very traumatic and very stressful” may seem plausible. But Mr Morrison will not be oblivious to the possibility that the Reynolds office is suffering a more general dysfunction, which would be bad news for the carriage of a portfolio as sensitive and important as defence. Again, it is unfortunate that the minister herself will not be available to clarify these matters in parliament. Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne, herself a former defence minister, will have been intensively briefed in order to cover for her colleague, both in an administrative and parliamentary sense, but this situation is far from ideal.
It was Mr Morrison himself who drew a parallel between the dramatic recent deterioration in Australia’s strategic and security outlook, and the ominous and unstable 1930s that exploded into a world war. Our geographic location, and our status as a key ally of the US and major trading partner of China, have put us in a difficult and risky position at a time of militant self-assertion by Beijing and uncertain American leadership. Before Ms Higgins’ going public put Senator Reynolds under intense political pressure, the minister and the government had been at a very delicate point in the renegotiation of Australia’s troubled $90bn submarine program. Naval Group global CEO Pierre-Eric Pommellet recently left Australia after failing to meet the minister, who had to go into hospital with heart problems on the day they were scheduled to meet. A new contract, guaranteeing 60 per cent Australian content in the boats, is yet to be signed. The apprehension is that Senator Reynolds’ extended medical leave will further delay things. Also on the agenda are difficult and sensitive decisions flowing from the Brereton inquiry into alleged abuses by some elements within our special forces in Afghanistan. All these threads come together to present the Prime Minister with an acute problem of political management and crisis resolution. At the same time, Attorney-General Christian Porter is also on leave following the surfacing of allegations of sexual assault dating back 33 years, which he denies categorically. Friends and family of the complainant, who took her own life, have sought to do justice to her memory, but it also true that Mr Porter has been on the receiving end of a reckless campaign by sections of the media and non-government politicians indifferent to the rule of law and the presumption of innocence. Mr Porter’s brief absence may provide a circuit breaker, but the government still faces demands for a misconceived extrajudicial inquiry, which cannot resolve the matter following the inevitable conclusion by police that they could take it no further. A coronial inquiry into the complainant’s death, if one goes ahead, appears unlikely to encompass the sexual assault allegation, and yet it could well require some participation by the nation’s first law officer. Mr Porter’s predicament presents Mr Morrison with another thorny political problem, and one that he must solve as leader of a government that, were it not for these challenges, would rightly be seen as being in a strong position.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Ridding themselves of dissent	The Australian	Academics’ rights to criticise colleagues’ work is on the line The fragility of intellectual freedom, a cornerstone of universities for centuries, has been underlined by James Cook University’s pursuit of marine physicist Peter Ridd, whom it dismissed in 2018. The institution is appealing against a Federal Circuit Court decision in April last year that found JCU had contravened the Fair Work Act when it dismissed Dr Ridd for criticising colleagues for their research on the impact of global warming on the Great Barrier Reef. The university later was ordered to pay Dr Ridd more than $1.2m for lost income, lost future income and costs.
The appeal, being heard in the Federal Court, is a battle royale between leading barristers. It goes to the heart of what is at stake in terms of free speech and the right of scientists to argue beyond the bounds of institutional groupthink, especially on contentious issues such as climate change. Dr Ridd has been an outspoken critic of the quality of scientific research on the Great Barrier Reef, saying its health has often been misrepresented. He was sacked after 27 years at JCU after being censured three times for publicly criticising his colleagues and the university. JCU has always insisted he was not sacked because of his scientific views but for denigrating the university and its employees and for breaching confidentiality.
On Tuesday, Dr Ridd’s barrister, Stuart Wood QC, told the court JCU’s enterprise agreement protected employees’ “intellectual freedom”. That freedom gave staff the right to express unpopular or controversial views and to disagree with university decisions, he said. This was subject only to the limitation that they could not vilify, harass, bully or intimidate other people, which JCU accepted Dr Ridd had not done, Mr Wood said. But Bret Walker SC, for JCU, said the enterprise agreement incorporated the university’s code of conduct, which required that staff act in a respectful, collegiate manner towards colleagues. The Australian believes frank debate on issues surrounding climate science serves the public interest. On contentious issues, robust argument is inevitable and helpful in arriving at the truth. As judge Salvatore Vasta said in his findings last year: “In the search for truth, it is an unfortunate consequence that some people may feel denigrated, offended, hurt or upset. It may not always be possible to act collegiately when diametrically opposed views clash in the search for truth.”	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Biden tackles US gun violence	The Australian	Action against the worsening firearms crisis is decades overdue There is, as Joe Biden says, “a long way to go” before effective gun control is achieved in the US. But the series of “initial executive orders” he has signed are a start, and it will be unfortunate if the powerful US gun lobby fails to heed the President’s warning about the damaging “blemish on our character as a nation” being done by the “epidemic” of unrelenting gun violence.
The measures are modest. They include a crackdown on so-called “ghost guns”, assembled from kits ordered online. Other steps include a clampdown on arm braces, which turn handguns into short-barrelled weapons capable of mass killings. Another “red flag” measure will allow police or family to petition courts for weapons to be taken away from anyone showing signs of danger. As limited as they are, there can be no doubt about the importance of such steps amid the US’s deepening gun crisis. There was a sharp reminder of this only hours before Mr Biden’s announcement. Former NFL football star Phillip Adams, 32, shot dead a much-loved doctor in Rock Hill, South Carolina, the doctor’s wife and two grandchildren, and airconditioning technician James Lewis, and wounded another person, before killing himself. Like many mass murders in a country with a staggering 400 million lethal weapons in private hands, there is no rational explanation for such carnage. The easy availability of guns is a major factor, with firearms sales, some costing as little as $200, reaching a record 23 million in 2020. Lack of control over the manufacture, sale and possession of assault weapons responsible for some of the worst mass shootings is a major problem. The national Shooting Sports Federation believes more than 20 million such weapons are in private hands.
As Mr Biden said at the White House on Thursday, an average of 316 people are being shot every day in the US. About 40,000 people are dying from gun violence each year, with handguns used in 78 per cent of mass shootings. The “epidemic of violence” was an “international embarrassment”.
According to the Gun Violence Archive, the incidence of “mass shootings” in which more than four people, excluding the shooter, are killed, is intensifying. There have been 133 this year. In the week between the March 16 shootings in Atlanta spas that killed eight people and the shootings at a Boulder, Colorado supermarket that killed 10, there were 850 shootings in which more than 250 people died. Three days before Mr Biden’s announcement, a man went to his daughter’s ninth birthday party and shot and killed her mother and two sisters before turning the gun on himself. The extent of the crisis is also evident in 24,000 gun suicides a year. Successive White House incumbents, on both sides of the political divide, have failed to address the problem. The mayhem confronting Mr Biden has been accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hampered crime fighting and exacerbated stresses caused by unemployment. According to the Gun Violence Archive, 300 children were shot and killed in 2020, a 50 per cent increase on 2019.
However predictable, opposition from the National Rifle Association gun lobby and Republicans to even the small measures announced by Mr Biden is shortsighted and uncompromising. They have denounced them as a contravention of the Second Amendment to the US constitution that enshrines the right to bear arms. But, as Mr Biden pointed out, when the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791, “certain people weren’t allowed to have weapons”. And weapons then were mostly muskets or flintlock pistols. America’s founding fathers could have had no foresight about the killing machines that are now so easily obtained. At this stage, Mr Biden’s measures are well short of what is needed to meet the challenge the US faces. It will be a tragedy if gun control opponents among Republicans and some Democrats continue to blindly ignore the reality of 40,000 lives lost each year. They have much to learn from John Howard’s courage and foresight after the Port Arthur massacre 25 years ago.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Sloppy errors, single Covid case lock down two million	The Australian	After telling others what to do Mr McGowan must fix the WA mess Locked down for five days over a single case of a mutant variant of COVID-19 that infected a quarantine security guard in his 20s, the people of Perth and its surrounds are entitled to feel West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has commandeered them into an alternative universe. They deserve support, as do the state’s contact tracers and other quarantine security guards. The last thing people need at an anxious time is the sort of vociferous derision Mr McGowan heaped on the Berejiklian government during Sydney’s northern beaches outbreak in December. On that occasion Mr McGowan, despite the outstanding record of the NSW contact tracing team, claimed our largest state seemed “to be engaging in a sort of form of whack-a-mole, they try and step on a gym here or a restaurant there. Rather than playing whack-a-mole, they need to kill all the moles”. Mr McGowan also advised his NSW counterpart, Gladys Berejiklian, to “look outside of NSW (to) what other states and territories are doing in order to crush and kill the virus … The idea that you tick along with the virus, and somehow that is a better model, is wrong”.
He was wrong. The NSW approach proved successful. Without hard lockdowns, Sydneysiders co-operated, taking sensible precautions to protect themselves, their families and their communities. At the same time, the city’s economy and society were able to function, with businesses remaining open and workers staying in their jobs.
What is seriously wrong in WA is that the state has failed to learn from and act on the hard, deadly lessons of last year, especially in Victoria. Elementary, sloppy mistakes in the west have been rampant, regrettably. As of Monday night, the state still had just a single case of COVID-19 — a guard from the Four Points by Sheraton in the Perth CBD. While the contagious UK variant of the virus has wreaked havoc overseas, it did not prove unusually contagious, fortunately, in Brisbane, which had a three-day lockdown under similar circumstances last month.
But, despite Mr McGowan’s harsh rhetoric and months of absurd, domestic border closures against the rest of the nation, his own systems, once tested, have fallen well short of what is needed to protect his citizens. As Paul Garvey reports on Tuesday, WA officials took several hours to inform the commonwealth and other states that they had detected community COVID-19 transmission, a ­possible breach of pandemic ­protocols. Despite confirming a positive test result at 3am AEDT (midnight on Saturday, Perth time), WA health officials told an Australian Health Protection Principal Committee meeting on Sunday morning that the state had not recorded any community infections.
The time taken to disclose the transmission is a sign of further strain on WA’s public health system, along with the failure to introduce safety protocols already in place in other states. In October, the McGowan government delivered a $1.2bn surplus. It would do well to invest some of it in its health system, the shortcomings of which contributed to the guard moving around Perth undetected for several days. As Victoria Laurie wrote on Sunday: “How could the hotel guard have contracted COVID-19 in a hotel quarantine site? How was he able to move around before his test result was known? Other questions are being asked about why Western Australia, with 10 months’ COVID-free grace, has not learned from quarantine gaffes in Victoria and Queensland by banning security guards from moonlighting in other jobs, especially ones that expose them to large groups.” The guard also worked as a ride-share driver. Hotel guards holding second jobs, Mr McGowan said on Monday, was “a complex issue … we are nearing a resolution … in the course of next week”. Better late than never, the state looks set to ban hotel quarantine workers from having a second job, which is likely to involve additional payments for hotel quarantine work.
The fiasco, justifiably, has prompted Australian Medical Association WA president Andrew Miller to describe the state’s quarantine system as “amateur and ridiculous”. The guard, Dr Miller said, had been “ working in a system that I believe didn’t provide him with enough PPE to protect him from the virus, that did not provide him with adequate ventilation and he was not getting daily testing”.
The lack of daily testing of hotel guards — a move agreed by national cabinet on January 8 — showed negligence and incompetence. Such testing has been in place in Victoria since December 7 and for some guards in NSW since December 14, where it was rolled out across the system in January. South Australia introduced it on January 8, followed a few days later by Queensland. WA’s weekly testing regime — the infected guard last tested negative on January 23 — was upgraded to daily saliva testing on Friday, January 29, Mr McGowan said on Sunday; too late. Following his bombastic criticisms of NSW, Mr McGowan left himself little room to move in the event of an outbreak. In his hyperbolic style, Mr McGowan insisted “dramatic action immediately” was needed from the outset. It will come at a cost. Time will tell how far the virus has spread. But on the strength of a single case, confining Perth residents to their homes, apart from shopping for essentials and medicine, to access healthcare, to exercise for up to an hour a day or to go to work (wearing a mask) if they cannot work at home, amounts to extreme overkill. Other leaders have resisted emulating Mr McGowan’s penchant for doling out unwanted advice. In NSW, which is bearing the brunt of quarantining returning Australians, Ms Berejiklian said elimination was impossible while the nation was bringing Australians home. Zero community transmission needed to be the goal, risk had to be managed. Until effective vaccines bring the pandemic under control there is no room for complacency. More than 2.2 million people have died from among more than 103 million cases worldwide. But overreactions to a single case, or a handful of cases, do more harm than good.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
US faces grim times before it can build a better future	The Australian	After the pandemic, world will need America’s leadership
US Surgeon-General Jerome Adams, his country’s top public health official, has left no doubt about the enormity of the challenges now confronting the world’s most powerful nation over the coronavirus. “This is going to be the hardest and saddest week of most Americans’ lives,” he said on Sunday. “This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localised. It’s going to be happening all over the country.” After Donald Trump’s grim warning last week that the country faces between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths from the pandemic, neither the gravity nor the imminence of the crisis in the US can be overstated. “It’s going to be ugly,” Mr Trump conceded, as his top infectious diseases adviser, Anthony Fauci, said experts were struggling to get the virus under control.
As Henry Kissinger, with all his wisdom and insight, noted in our pages on Monday, there are surreal aspects to the COVID-19 pandemic. None is more surreal than seeing the US, the world’s biggest and most successful economy, at the epicentre of the crisis, battling uphill odds.
Life in New York, at the heart of American greatness, as Washington correspondent Cameron Stewart noted on Monday, has been rapidly transformed. He summed up what has happened to the US as a whole: “Just a few weeks ago, crowds flocked to see Broadway shows while bars and restaurants were pumping and tourists crowded into Times Square. Now the city is an eerie ghost town — a lone taxi driving down Fifth Avenue, shuttered-up shops, silent museums and grim-faced, frightened people.” Who would have thought that a virus spawned in a fetid “wet market” in faraway Wuhan, China, only weeks ago could have done this to one of the world’s greatest and most vibrant cities? And yet it has. Nothing is more indicative of what has befallen the US as it deals with a total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases surging towards 350,000, 123,000 of them in New York, which has already recorded 4160 deaths and is projected to suffer a death toll of at least 16,000. No one can be sure about where the pandemic is headed in the US, or anywhere else. Countries and cities everywhere are similarly afflicted. With more than 1.3 million cases globally so far, and 70,000 deaths, the outlook everywhere is grim.
But all eyes are on Mr Trump as the leader of the free world, and he must be unrelenting in providing the guidance that is needed to overcome the immediate challenge in America and ensure that, once the crisis has passed, the US continues to provide the strong global political and economic direction the world needs. Mr Trump has not been without critics over his responses to the pandemic. His early dismissal of warnings about a potential crisis, when he compared it to the flu, didn’t help.
“We have it totally under control, it’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine,” he said in January. As recently as February 28, he said: “It’s going to disappear. One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” Mr Trump has come a long way since then, and it is to his credit that as the imminence and full extent of the threat to the US has evolved, he has been showing the strong leadership that is needed, with Dr Kissinger talking of “a solid job” being done by the administration.Any administration, Republican or Democrat, would have been tested mightily by the COVID-19 pandemic. Having been convinced of the threat the US faced, Mr Trump has done well to lead from the front, working closely with New York’s Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo and leaders across the country to provide the back-up, including the thousands of ventilators, needed to meet the challenge. For the US and the world as it battles the deadly pandemic, the stakes could not be higher. Dr Adams clearly believes profoundly difficult days lie ahead. Mr Trump’s prospects for re-election in November depend in no small measure on how he navigates the US through this grave crisis. So do hopes for Mr Trump being able to realise his frequently expressed determination to get through the crisis and get the US economy back to work. As Dr Kissinger argued, when the crisis passes our leaders will have to “build the future”.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Plan to go soon, go hard, go business, go pensioners	The Australian	After the stimulus we had to have, bold reform must follow
A global pandemic has been declared, pockets of the nation are being shut down and the budget surplus, a rare plant that flowers in fecund eras, is gone. For how long? It depends on how well the Morrison government manages what was first diagnosed as a supply-side crunch but has quickly become a sharp shock to demand as well. The government’s $17.6bn fiscal response — which has ballooned rhetorically and physically in gestation — has several virtues, as well as risks. Payment systems are in place, so there’s no need to create new bureaucracies or whole industries from scratch, like the home insulation debacle of a decade ago. At this stage, the quantum appears proportionate. A potential flaw is the leap of faith required — that business, facing weaker orders and considering layoffs, can be enticed to spend big on plant and equipment after sitting for years on expansion plans. We shall see. Financial markets, however, were not persuaded by news of the package; the local bourse continued its steady spiral. Traders were even less impressed by US President Donald Trump’s $US50bn ($77bn) plan and his momentous decision to suspend all travel between Europe and the US.
Inevitably, Scott Morrison’s stimulus package will be compared to Kevin Rudd’s October 2008 $10.4bn cash splash in response to the financial infarction following the collapse of Lehman Brothers a month earlier. Treasury’s advice then was to “go early, go hard, go households”, putting money in the hands of consumers in the lead-up to Christmas. In this instance, a rolling health crisis is quickly knocking down the economy’s non-financial parts. First, education and tourism were whacked by the travel bans, which began on February 1. Then supply chains were disrupted for retailers and manufacturers; export sales of food and resources stalled. Now, plummeting confidence is hitting sales, hurting cash flow and imperilling employment.
The Coalition’s response reflects the immediate challenges. Before June 30, there’s a $5.9bn cashflow boost to business and $4.8bn in cheques to low-income households. The “front-loaded” strategy is to put money in the wallets of people who will spend it pronto, using established welfare and tax office delivery channels. At the end of this month, 6.5 million people — age and disability pensioners, veterans, students and eligible concession card holders — will get a one-off $750 payment. Why wait weeks to open the tap? The measures will be put before the parliament at the end of March, the last sitting week before the May 12 budget. It’s inconceivable that Labor would block the omnibus bill for the package.
All up, the government will pump almost $11bn into a sagging economy in the June quarter, a fillip after gross domestic product contracts by perhaps as much as 1 per cent this quarter. The optics are a no-brainer. By quarantining the drop in GDP to March, which was also affected by bushfires, the government is now likely to avoid a second negative GDP quarter in June and the electoral poison of a recession.
But wait, there’s more. Increasing the business instant asset write-off to $150,000 and accelerating depreciation deductions will cost the budget $9.2bn in the coming two financial years; Treasury then claws back $5.3bn in the following two years. In this way, the initial stimulus shot to June 2022 is $22.9bn. Josh Frydenberg argues the package is biased towards maintaining employment. To this end, the Treasurer is spending $6.7bn on helping about 700,000 small and medium-sized businesses cover the cost of wages and salaries. An enterprise will receive up to $25,000 and a minimum of $2000. As well, there’s a $1.3bn wage subsidy for employers to retain apprentices and trainees; the measure would cover half of a young worker’s wage in the nine months to September 30.
Overall, the package meets the tests the Prime Minister set for officials. He asked for measures that were targeted, scalable and up to the task at hand. A $1bn regional fund targets communities reliant on education, tourism and agriculture; fees and charges will be waived for national and marine parks. But to get even more traction on the ground, the states will have to step up their efforts. South Australia has been quick off the mark, but it needs to be. There isn’t much NSW and Victoria can do to speed up mega projects in road and rail, so the focus must be on public asset maintenance work and reducing imposts on employers — licence fees, payroll taxes, tolls and other charges. Like Canberra, state treasuries will be battered — but they start in a weaker, debt-heavy position.
Mercifully, the proposed measures have end dates. Mr Morrison argues this means the structure of the budget is not compromised. We shall see if his claim the budget will roar back into the black when the COVID-19 threat has passed is validated. It may well be that the health crisis imposes a new layer of bureaucracy and ongoing claims for handouts. Given traditional monetary policy is as accommodative as it gets, and printing money to buy bonds is the Reserve Bank’s only option if it cuts the official cash rate again, the weight falls on Mr Frydenberg’s shoulders.The budget is being framed in crisis. As a nation, we are creative, resilient and flexible; sacrifices are made for the greater good. Australians get change, as long as leaders are straight and explain the benefit of what they are doing. The parliamentary circus is another matter. In any case, the Treasurer must look beyond the horizon of contagion and red ink, slow growth and flagging competitiveness, and offer a path out of the economic mediocrity we are in. Riding mining price booms, scrambling like crazy when hit by shocks, is no way to lasting prosperity. The budget must not use COVID-19 as an excuse to delay or shirk reform. There’s a rare opportunity to reboot how we work, back innovation, invest and grow our economy. Rather than thinking small, leaning low in a defensive crouch, we need a bold government: to go early, go hard and go economy-wide on reform.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Best thing for Israel is a clear result	The Australian	After years of uncertainty, voters deserve a stable government
With so much at stake in the outcome, it will be a pity if voting on Tuesday in Israel’s fourth election in two years ends up with yet another inconclusive result. The genius of the Jewish state, demonstrated in recent weeks by its remarkable, world-leading success in delivering COVID-19 vaccinations to most of its 10 million people, enabling the reopening of the economy, is incontestable. So is its achievement in being the Middle East’s only functioning democracy where the rule of law prevails, despite facing bellicose daily threats to its existence from neighbours such Iran as well as the hostility of countries across the world trying to bring it down. But Israeli politics is another matter, and the challenge to Israeli voters is to learn from the messy political uncertainty of the past two years and elect a stable government that has at least a decent chance of serving a full four-year term.
Once again, as David Horovitz wrote in The Times of Israel, the election is “all about Bibi”. It is a referendum on whether the country’s longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, 71, should be allowed to form another governing coalition or whether the forces ranged against him should finally get their way and supplant him. As in the previous inconclusive elections, no opinion poll shows Mr Netanyahu or any of his opponents close to getting the 61 Knesset seats needed for government. Projections suggest his right-wing Likud party will win 30 seats. With ultra-Orthodox allies and a small far-right party, he could get 50 seats.
None of the parties determined to get rid of Mr Netanyahu does much better in the polls. In that lies his hope of doing a deal with former close ally and long-serving cabinet minister Naftali Bennett’s Yamina party, which is projected to win 10 to 12 seats. Mr Bennett has been adamant, however, that it’s time for Mr Netanyahu to go and, coincidentally, time for the Yamina leader to be prime minister.
Two years of political squabbling have shown that nothing is ever set in stone (much less in principle) in Israeli politics. In the election wash-up and protracted coalition-building that will follow, there is no certainty Mr Netanyahu will again emerge triumphant or will be replaced by Mr Bennett, Yesh Atid centrist leader Yair Lapid or New Hope party founder Gideon Sa’ar, the most recent Likud defector and an erstwhile close Netanyahu aide.
The Israeli Prime Minister remains a deeply divisive figure. Former cabinet colleagues insist they want him out. So, according to most polls, do at least 58 per cent of Israelis. Yet in a poll for preferred prime minister last week, Mr Netanyahu got 37 per cent, well ahead of Mr Lapid on 21 per cent, Mr Bennett on 10 per cent and Mr Sa’ar on 9 per cent.
Mr Netanyahu’s lead doubtless owes much to his success with vaccinations and peace deals with several Arab states, a diplomatic achievement long thought inconceivable. He remains the target, however, of damaging controversy surrounding his trial on fraud changes. There is no certainty that if he succeeds in again becoming prime minister he will be able to form a government that will last any longer than those he led in the past two years. What voters decide about him holds the key to the election and, in no small measure, Israel’s future. Without Donald Trump in the White House and with the new Biden administration seeking to rekindle the Iran nuclear deal, and hostile international pressure building up in support of recognising Palestinian statehood, the challenges facing Israel are immense. The stakes in the election could not be higher. Whoever becomes prime minister — be it Mr Netanyahu or those seeking to depose him — deserves to be allowed to govern uninhibited by the constant threat of political chaos. The Jewish state’s admirable democracy and the profound existential challenges it faces demand better than a return to yet more instability and an inevitable fifth election.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
EDITORIAL Covid-19 blame game kicks off	The Northern Advocate	Agame of international political football is under way. The match-up mainly pits the United States Government — caught flat-footed in the pandemic — against China, trying to pin blame on the nation where Covid-19 emerged.
President Donald Trump, who refuses to shoulder any responsibility himself, thinks Beijing should. “It could have been stopped in China before it started, and it wasn’t.”
US criticism of Beijing’s secretive, authoritarian system is shared by two of the hardest-hit countries, Britain and France.
Trump’s presidential campaign is running ads on the blame-China theme. The New York Times reports that the Republican Party sees it as an election strategy. US officials have talked up a theory that the virus escaped a lab in Wuhan, although scientific analysis has pointed to wildlife being the source.
Trump accused the World Health Organisation of being “China-centric” as he cut US funding to the agency.
The WHO issued its first warning about the mystery virus in the first week of January. On January 14 a WHO official told reporters there was “the possibility of human-to-human transmission” and “the possibility of super-spreading events”.
Last week, AP reported that between January 14 and 19, top Chinese officials knew they were facing a pandemic. President Xi Jinping warned the public on January 20 but by then, AP reported, “more than 3000 people had been infected during almost a week of public silence”.
Can China’s actions be blamed for the severe damage caused in some countries or were there enough warnings and time to limit the fallout? Variations in outcomes appear to relate to how quickly and decisively countries reacted.
The Sars animal virus epidemic of 2002-03 originated in China and affected 26 countries. This time, even as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea quickly took protective action in January, nations further afield failed to bolster their defences. An ability to manufacture protective health equipment in an emergency will surely be part of many future national pandemic plans.
There’s little doubt Chinese authorities were less transparent than they could have been, dithered early on as crowds still congregated, and have not fully accounted for all victims of the coronavirus.
However, those charges can also be levelled at other countries. —	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Plenty of refund turbulence for Air NZ	Wanganui Chronicle	Air New Zealand faces yet another challenge as its image takes a pasting over ticket refunds.
Deep in Covid-caused financial strife, the airline is now fighting a public relations battle as Consumer NZ and a number of its customers roast it over refunds.
The airline can hold the line on non-refundable tickets. They are just that, the fine print says so.
But then it gets complicated. Where does the moral obligation to pay those passengers who bought the usually less expensive tickets start and finish?
Consumer NZ had to push the airline along with a complaint to the Commerce Commission to ensure passengers got refunds they were legally entitled to under international rules covering flights to and through the United States.
Now Consumer is pushing further, arguing that Air NZ with access to a taxpayer loan of $900 million should repay the non-refundable fares as well. It argues that the airline is in a stronger financial position than those who booked non-refundable fares to bear the financial cost.
Air New Zealand argues that it not only has the law on its side but also the country’s greater good to hold on to the cash which could add up to close to $100m.
This at an airline whose annual revenue of $6 billion has almost totally collapsed and has so far laid off 4000 of its 12,500 staff.
It has already seen its cash reserves plunge from more than $1b at the start of the year to around $640m at the end of last month.
Frankly put, the airline is saying to holders of non-refundable fares it’s a case of “you or us” when it comes to wearing the cost.
The airline is 52 per cent taxpayer owned and is doing everything it can to avoid drawing on the Government loan which could result in a higher level of state ownership if debt is converted to equity.
Consumer Affairs Minister Kris Faafoi has indicated the law may be changed to bring New Zealand into line with not only the US but also Europe, but that will not help those caught in the current mess.
While the merits of the substantive argument can be argued, one thing is certain. Air New Zealand finds itself in the midst of a PR storm that didn’t have to be this bad.

EDITORIAL Plenty of refund turbulence for Air NZ	The Northern Advocate	Air New Zealand faces yet another challenge as its image takes a pasting over ticket refunds.
Deep in Covid-caused financial strife, the airline is now fighting a public relations battle as Consumer NZ and a number of its customers roast it over refunds.
The airline can hold the line on non-refundable tickets. They are just that, the fine print says so.
But then it gets complicated. Where does the moral obligation to pay those passengers who bought the usually less expensive tickets start and finish?
Consumer NZ had to push the airline along with a complaint to the Commerce Commission to ensure passengers got refunds they were legally entitled to under international rules covering flights to and through the United States.
Now Consumer is pushing further, arguing that Air NZ with access to a taxpayer loan of $900 million should repay the non-refundable fares as well. It argues that the airline is in a stronger financial position than those who booked non-refundable fares to bear the financial cost.
Air New Zealand says that it not only has the law on its side but also the country\u2019s greater good to hold on to the cash which could add up to close to $100m.
This at an airline whose annual revenue of $6 billion has almost totally collapsed and has so far laid off 4000 of its 12,500 staff.
It has already seen its cash reserves plunge from more than $1b at the start of the year to around $640m at the end of last month.
Frankly put, the airline is saying to holders of non-refundable fares it\u2019s a case of \u201Cyou or us\u201D when it comes to wearing the cost.
The airline is 52 per cent taxpayer owned and is doing everything it can to avoid drawing on the Government loan which could result in a higher level of state ownership if debt is converted to equity.
Air New Zealand finds itself in the midst of a PR storm that didn\u2019t have to be this bad.
It is going above and beyond with credits for those with non-refundable tickets but this has not been trumpeted. By its own admission, its systems have been overwhelmed by passengers inquiring about them or wanting to put them to use on a domestic network that is now growing with encouraging speed.

Defence equipment below par	The Australian	Air force planes must fly; naval vessels need to be at sea On July 1 Scott Morrison announced a major update to Australia’s defence strategy and capabilities. In his remarks at the Australian Defence Force Academy, the Prime Minister revealed an astute appreciation of the rapidly changing geo-strategic situation under way in our immediate region and the wider Indo-Pacific. He committed the government to significant enhancements of Australia’s maritime strike and cyber capabilities. The goals were commendable. Respected strategic thinkers are concerned about the growing assertiveness of China, particularly in the South China Sea and across our vital sea lines of communication. In committing the government to increased defence expenditure amid the worst economic crisis since the Depression, Mr Morrison showed sound judgment. We strongly supported the measures.
As Mr Morrison said, the crucial elements of his plan were not the hardware, equipment and state-of-the-art capabilities. Rather, he stressed that the efficient collaboration of defence industries and the Department of Defence was of critical importance: “There is an accountability to these plans … as I know the service chiefs and others are very well aware of, and the secretary, and that gives me a lot of confidence because the investments we’re making here today and for the longer term require the accountability of implementation.” That is why Ben Packham’s revelation, reported on Wednesday, that some of the most important platforms in our arsenal are failing to operate at the operational tempo forecast for them is disturbing. It is not good enough.
Australia has an unenviable history of incompetent defence design and procurement. The litany of cost overruns and unsuitable platforms forced numerous reviews during the past two decades. Defence has held so-called efficiency reviews and first principles reviews. Yet, as Packham writes, despite a colossal $4.2bn blowout in sustainment costs, several combat capabilities are offline for unacceptable periods. Of particular concern is the 15 per cent shortfall in flying hours for RAAF aircraft including the vital Growler, the electronic warfare version of the Hornet. Frontline naval platforms, such as the air warfare destroyer, the Collins-class subs and the Anzac frigates, were tied up for 1185 days when they should have been at sea.
Given that the government expects that air and naval assets will be the cornerstone of its updated strategic posture, this is of significant concern. Already there are serious concerns about the delays and cost blowouts of the replacement for the ageing Collins-class subs. It is the most expensive defence procurement in our history. The sorry saga exposed in the budget papers inspires little confidence that the unwieldy Russell Offices bureaucracy has learned its lessons from the interminable reviews and so-called reforms of the past. Further inertia cannot be tolerated. Many Australians have suffered financial hardship since the COVID-19 crisis began. Yet the Defence Department and its vast network of suppliers, consultants and change managers have been spared cuts. More important, our strategic situation has deteriorated markedly since the last defence white paper was released. The urgent remediation of our forces envisioned by the government was appropriate. Its implementation cannot be squandered. The stakes are too high to permit failure. Mr Morrison and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds must demand the accountability they insisted would underpin this plan back in July.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Teaching methods must add up	The Australian	Alan Tudge is correct to focus on curriculum and quality teaching More than $23bn in extra funding has been allocated, and millions of words printed, to improve the performance of Australian schools since 2013 — with too little to show for it. Yet again, new education targets are being set, as they were by Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, who announced an “education revolution’’ after winning office in 2007. Numerous ministers, from both sides, have expressed similar ambitions since.
On Thursday, Education Minister Alan Tudge will unveil his goal — to elevate Australia to the top of the global rankings for student academic achievement by 2030. It is a formidable challenge, but important to the national interest. Since 2000, in the OECD’s PISA testing of 15-year-olds, Australia’s performance in reading has declined sharply. In his speech to the Menzies Research Institute, Mr Tudge will present the alarming facts. Australian students are now, on average, about 1½ years behind Singaporean students when it comes to reading and science, and three years behind on maths, as Rebecca Urban reports.
The decline has been consistent. Australia’s top students are less likely to score in the highest achievement bands, and lower-performing students are falling below the proficient standard. As Mr Tudge will say: “The problem is not a growing divide in student results; it is a decline in performance across the board.’’ The minister brings 20 years of experience to the task of rectifying it. He was a co-founder of the Teach for Australia program, and he worked on education policy with Noel Pearson in the Cape York Partnership. His expectations are realistic. Australia will not bridge the gap between us and Singapore “overnight’’, but building on the initiatives of some of his predecessors and improvements under way in some states, he is on the right track.
Within the national curriculum, Mr Tudge wants a concentration on the fundamentals of reading, mathematics, civics and citizenship — the building blocks for further study. Decluttering the curriculum makes sense. A recent report by the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority comparing Australia with Singapore found our Asian neighbour recently reduced the volume of content in its curriculum by one-third, shifting its focus to “learning and teaching outcomes”.
Mr Tudge’s focus on teaching quality and his impending review of the teacher education sector are also vital. OECD data suggests teachers in Australia feel less well prepared than those across the OECD average in relation to curriculum content, pedagogy (teaching and learning methods), managing student behaviour, and monitoring student progress. As the minister has found, some teachers are still graduating from their courses insufficiently prepared to teach in a classroom. In some cases, the courses focused too much on theory; in others, evidence-based teaching methods were not taught. When La Trobe University recently offered a short course in teaching phonics — the tried and tested method of teaching young children to read — 1000 teachers signed up; an indictment, as Mr Tudge says, on education faculties that they were not taught it in the first place, given the weight of evidence that it works.
Curriculum reform will not be straightforward, however. As Urban wrote on Wednesday’s front page, the process is in disarray after ACARA twice rejected a draft maths curriculum, amid concerns it was based around vague and potentially confusing ideas and would be too complex for teachers, many of whom are not maths subject specialists.
Many parents paying $50 an hour and more to have their children coached through Year 11 and 12 maths know how problematic the subject is for many students. It is also a prerequisite for major university courses, yet the percentage of Year 11 and 12 students enrolling in it in recent years has declined. That trend, in turn, has left the nation short of STEM graduates, including engineers, specialist maths teachers and some medical professionals.
Robust discussion among professional educators in arriving at the best curriculum is no bad thing. What matters is that students learn maths well, a process that needs to start early in primary school and progress through to senior schooling. As Centre for Independent Studies research fellow Glenn Fahey says, there is much to learn from Singapore in terms of curriculum rigour and quality of teaching.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Another Putin critic poisoned	The Australian	Alexei Navalny is the latest Russian targeted for attack
Confirmation that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned has added his name to a sickening rollcall of President Vladimir Putin’s adversaries who have ended up dead or fighting for their lives. Toxicology tests on Mr Navalny, 44, who was flown from Omsk in Siberia last Saturday to Berlin’s Charite Hospital, concluded he was poisoned by cholinesterase inhibitors, found in pesticides, and by agents that damage the central nervous system. Adding to speculation of deep-state Kremlin dirty tricks, doctors disclosed that Russia’s most effective opposition leader since Mr Putin came to power was being treated with atropine. That is the same antidote used after the brazen attempt in the English town of Salisbury in 2018 to kill former Russian military intelligence defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia using novichok, a chemical weapon from the Soviet era.
Underlining the link with the Salisbury attack, which was the first use of a chemical weapon in Europe since World War II, Navalny ally Leonid Volkov said: “The world’s most famous cholinesterase inhibitor is called novichok.” That link — and the litany of similar attempts to wipe out Putin critics — shows the need for a strong Western response to the poisoning of Mr Navalny, whose internet videos documenting the corruption of Russia’s rulers have been viewed by millions.
Mr Navalny’s poisoning — and the way fearful Russian doctors were ordered to cover up evidence of it — show how iniquitous the Putin regimen is in oppressing its opponents. Those targeted previously include Vladimir Kara-Murza, an opposition activist who survived two poisonings; Boris Nemtsov, the opposition leader before Mr Navalny, who was gunned down near the Kremlin in 2015; and Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian secret agent and defector poisoned by polonium-210 in London in 2006. One of the chief suspects in Litvinenko’s assassination was given a seat in the Russian parliament a year later and in 2015 was awarded a special medal by Mr Putin.
To the shame of Western democracies, Mr Putin so far has suffered little blowback for the unscrupulous attacks on his opponents. Only a few dozen Russian diplomats have been expelled from Western capitals. It will be a travesty if the response to the outrageous attempt to kill Mr Navalny is another meaningless shrug of the shoulders. From the start of his presidency, Donald Trump has been bewilderingly indulgent towards Mr Putin. When asked in 2017 about the Russian despot’s record as a “killer”, he responded: “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?” In June, Mr Trump proffered a major new sign of friendship to the former KGB colonel, inviting him to the summit of G7 leaders at Camp David. As a foil against any criticism, he framed the invitation in the context of similar invitations to Scott Morrison, India’s Narendra Modi and South Korea’s Moon Jae-in, all leaders of vibrant democracies. The G7 summit has been delayed. Whenever it is held, Mr Trump’s invitation to Mr Putin should not be renewed. Following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Mr Putin was expelled from what was then the G8. He has been clawing to get back ever since. It would be unthinkable to allow him to re-enter an exclusive group of democratic nations that observes the rule of law.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

NATO leader right to look east	The Australian	Alliances of democracies are seeking to counter China’s aggression
As the West’s premier military alliance for 72 years, NATO’s focus has been primarily on its founding post-war mandate as “the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation”. But its 30 member nations should consider current Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg’s warning that, given the growing challenge posed by China, it is time for the organisation to embrace a significantly broader outlook and work “even more closely” with Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, India and Brazil.
China, as Mr Stoltenberg told a gathering at Chatham House in London last week, “does not share our values. It does not respect fundamental human rights and tries to intimidate other countries”. He made that observation in the context of the “evolving nature of the military threats” confronting NATO members. It was necessary, he said, to secure NATO members’ “infrastructure and supply lines so they are not dependent on countries with opposing outlooks”. Foreign investment and critical infrastructure needed to be controlled so “they are not vulnerable to hostile powers”. NATO members’ values of “freedom, democracy and the rule of law” had to be protected, Mr Stoltenberg said. The organisation’s strategic imperatives would be served best by “reaching out to potential new partners in the community of democracies’’.
Mr Stoltenberg’s speech coalesces with the view of US President Joe Biden, who has emphasised the need for the world’s democracies to get together to push back against Chinese and Russian malevolence.
The fact one-third of the world’s maritime trade passes through the South China Sea demonstrates why European NATO nations have a direct interest in helping to resist Chinese threats to freedom of navigation through the South China Sea. So do recent Chinese strategic moves, such as the establishment by the People’s Liberation Army of Beijing’s first overseas military base.
Thousands of Chinese troops are now stationed in Djibouti, a small nation of a million people in a highly strategic position on the northeast coast of the Horn of Africa, beside major trade routes. As Jacquelin Magnay reports on Monday a proposal by Boris Johnson, backed by Mr Biden, to expand the G7 to bring Australia, South Korea and India into a D10 of democratic nations, has been deferred. That does not diminish the importance, however, of achieving a broader group of democratic nations Mr Biden wants to see. Britain is also considering whether it should join the Quad, an informal alliance between Japan, India, Australia and the US. NATO was put under strain by Donald Trump’s ambivalence towards traditional alliances. But its central role in co-ordinating coalition forces in Afghanistan, including those from Australia, showed its effectiveness in confronting a major challenge far from its normal purview.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Trump needs to find his running game	The Northern Advocate	American elections tend to tighten sharply in the home stretch. But as the pandemic worsens in the United States it is quite possible that shift will be minor.
Covid-19 is accelerating in the US, having passed 138,000 deaths and 3.5 million cases. It took 80 days to reach its first 500,000 cases and just eight days to reach its last 500,000. Millions of people have lost their jobs.
Those conditions are reflected in polls that show President Donald Trump lagging nationally by 8 to 10 per cent. In the past 45 years, only Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan polled better than Democratic challenger Joe Biden is at this stage.
The trajectory of the outbreak — and Trump’s fortunes in November — are unlikely to greatly improve unless he drastically reverses his course.
There are actions Trump could take to help the situation and his own prospects, starting with a primetime address to the country.
He could hold an online meeting with all the governors to agree on a strategy, which could include a nationwide mask-wearing directive. Trump could wear a mask in public rather than as a one-off. Hard-hit states could be told to introduce border restrictions. He could outline jobs projects and more financial aid that directly helps families.
Leaving individual states to deal with the problem is a failure, practically and politically. It means he does not allow himself the option of taking action to improve the situation yet cannot absolve himself of responsibility because people expect national leadership in a crisis.
By trying to project a sense of normality when life is not normal, he risks being seen as callous, out of step and irrelevant. In trying to avoid tackling the pandemic, his White House speeches have become word stews with multiple ingredients. On Friday he spoke about lightbulbs, showerheads and dishwashers. Earlier, he ranged from China to illegal immigration, crime, taxes, trade and statues.
When focused on the virus, Trump has made controversial interventions. Now he is pushing for schools to reopen in the northern autumn. Before, he pushed for early economic reopening.
Biden leads in polling on every issue of importance to voters, except on who is best to handle the economy. With 15 weeks to go, Trump is on defence by his goal line.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses

Resilience key to survive Covid	The Australian	Amid isolation, human warmth matters more than ever Only those who have lost a loved one to suicide understand the raw pain. No matter how many anniversaries and birthdays pass, emptiness, regrets over what might have been and sometimes a dollop of guilt continue to flicker. R U OK? Day, on the second Thursday of September each year, encourages public discussion of social isolation and its consequences, including suicide. Amid COVID-19, it has rarely been as important. This year it coincides with World Suicide Prevention Day. Both have touched a chord. Time will tell if the fallout from the pandemic increases Australia’s suicide toll. In normal years that amounts to about 3000 lives lost. The devastating effects on those left behind will be felt years and decades after COVID-19 passes.
Politicians sometimes refer to “COVID creep” and the insidious nature of the disease. But its insidious effects on hearts and minds also need to be brought into the open. Amid job losses, isolation, lockdowns, businesses folding, anxiety over exams, fear of banks foreclosing, working parents struggling to homeschool children, adult children stranded overseas, hard borders, illness, medical treatments postponed and being unable to attend loved ones’ funerals, reports are surfacing of Australians taking their own lives. Some are dreading a lonely Christmas. Others miss the companionship of the village square, the cuppa and chat after church or a yarn and a drink at the 19th hole. In Melbourne, some people who live alone are popping out to the shops just to speak to another human being.
In terms of suicides, the most senseless losses are those of young lives. Two teenage boys with open, kind and seemingly happy faces died within weeks of each other recently at a bayside secondary college in Brisbane; nine Sydney students, mainly in years 11 and 12, from public and private north shore schools, have died since January. And as Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph reported last weekend, the NSW seaside community of Kiama has been devastated by the suicides of seven people in as many weeks. They include a 14-year-old schoolboy, a uni student and his mate, a pilates instructor in her 30s and the dad of two primary school students. Another seven have died across the wider Illawarra region. The University of Sydney’s Brain and Mind Centre recently forecast that even in a best-case scenario, Australia could see an increase in suicide deaths of at least 13.7 per cent across the next five years.
Help is available for those who seek it — or whose families, friends, doctors or teachers encourage them to seek it. When the first wave of COVID-19 was taking hold in March, University of Melbourne youth mental health professor Patrick McGorry said the pandemic would be a major threat to mental health. Its effects would be felt as people lost their sense of security, confronted their fear of COVID, were less able to exercise and to mix socially and professionally. Finding the resilience to cope would be vital. As Professor McGorry noted, many would need help and support. Being observant of other people as well as tolerant and understanding were vital. So was encouraging those who were struggling to seek help, and accepting help. Special days promoting good causes and symbolised by coloured ribbons, flowers, red noses and the like are almost routine. But the R U OK? Day organisers have a simple, worthwhile message — stay connected and reach out. In current circumstances, a stiff-upper-lip culture of silence is unhelpful. Given the pandemic and bushfires, many people, asked if they were OK, might be likely to answer no. As R U OK? chief executive Katherine Newton says, it is important to know what to say next. Making time to listen with an open mind, checking in regularly and encouraging people to seek support before they are in crisis make a difference.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Higher costs, smarter health	The Australian	An ageing population and new technology pose challenges
AMA president Tony Bartone warned on Wednesday of the “enormous strain” on our hospitals as the country ages. It’s true Australia has by global standards an enviable health system with pretty good outcomes relative to costs. Some of the issues adverted to by Dr Bartone are First World problems in the sense that we usually have the means to pay for costly medical technology. Even so, the pressure on hospitals is undeniable and will increase as the baby boomers age. For that reason, rising health costs are a powerful argument for building up budget surpluses, paying down debt, boosting productivity and improving the efficiency of health services.
In 1975, the number of people aged 15-64 for every person 65 and over was about seven. In 2015, it was less than five, and it’s projected to be just under three in 2055. Demography is leaving us with fewer people to earn and pay taxes, and more people to support and receive payments. Health costs spike rapidly with age, and the number of people 65 and over is expected to more than double between 2015 and 2055. New technology and drugs can reduce the unit-cost of treatment, and cut hospital stays, but the enabling of safer, more widespread use among the elderly can push up the total expense.
The latest Intergenerational Report from the federal Treasury noted the rise in healthcare spending per person, in constant dollars, from $670 in 1975 to $2830 in 2015 and an estimated $6460 in 2055. Most of this is driven not by demography but by rising incomes, wage costs, disease rates and technological change. Yet these factors interact with ageing, since much medical R&D targets the elderly, who are often the first and heaviest users of new treatments.
Dr Bartone makes the point that hospitals have to contend with rising demand for elective surgery, longer waiting lists and congested emergency departments. It’s never been easy but both levels of government have to do more to avoid wasteful cost-shifting. As paymasters, suppliers and employers they need to get a sharper focus on health sector areas where reform is especially in need and can pay sizeable dividends. Inflexible public sector arrangements and the stimulus of private competition both demand careful attention.
It’s a truism that with better primary care, the strain on hospitals can be eased. Advances in treatment can certainly assist, although the net effect on cost is hard to predict. Allowing private health insurers to offer comprehensive cover for treatment outside hospital would help rebalance the system towards primary and community care, as well as underpin overall financial viability.As for emergency rooms, excess demand in the regions may indeed reflect scarcity of GPs — hence the proposal to reward versatile bush GPs with specialist rebates. While costly, the move would improve doctor numbers in the country. In the cities, problems too often arise from misuse by patients. There is no substitute for personal responsibility, and well-designed co-payments can nurture this. Diseases of lifestyle can be averted, with good choices promoting a healthier future.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Traumatised staffer needed help	The Australian	An allegation of a serious crime, rape, was mishandled abysmally
Brittany Higgins, the former Liberal staff member who allegedly was raped in Parliament House in Canberra in 2019, is right when she says: “Everyone should feel safe to report sexual assault without fear of losing their job. These incidents shouldn’t have to play out in the media for change to happen.” Her decision to ask Australian Federal Police to investigate the incident is right. It allegedly occurred on the couch in then defence industry minister Linda Reynolds’s office in the early hours of Saturday, March 23, 2019, after a night out drinking on the Friday. For the sake of alleged victims and alleged perpetrators — who have a right to defend themselves — claims of rape, sexual assault, abuse and other crimes are best handled through the legal system. The decision of whether to report such incidents ultimately rests with alleged victims. And to be fair to Senator Reynolds, Ms Higgins told news.com.au that the minister encouraged her to go to the police. But as Senator Reynolds acknowledged in her unreserved apology to Ms Higgins on Tuesday, not enough was done to help and support her. The minister also confirmed the alleged perpetrator had been “terminated” from her office for a “security breach” shortly after the incident.
The treatment of Ms Higgins, who was 24 at the time of the alleged incident, also fell short in other areas. Senator Reynolds, rightly, “deeply, deeply” regrets speaking with her about the attack in the room where it allegedly took place. Under the circumstances, it was callous that Ms Higgins reportedly was given the option to go home to the Gold Coast during the 2019 election campaign but was told this would affect her ability to apply for a future Liberal Party job. Nor is it good enough that she was made to feel, she says, “like a political problem”. Senator Reynolds insists, however, that she never indicated to Ms Higgins that her job was at risk.
As reported on Wednesday, Parliament House security guards were so concerned about the handling of the allegations that they raised concerns in confidential submissions to an inquiry about the Department of Parliamentary Services. The whistleblowers claim that reports about the 2019 incident were altered to remove details and soften the graphic language describing how Ms Higgins was found. Questions need to be asked about why security guards who saw Ms Higgins after the alleged ­assault did not call for medical help. Nor was it good enough, as we reported on Tuesday, that after Ms Higgins asked “at least half a dozen times” to view CCTV footage, a staff member of Senator Reynolds told her she could not. Several Coalition and Labor senators reportedly have known about the allegations made in the inquiry, including the possibility that the Department of Parliamentary Services destroyed significant evidence by immediately steam cleaning the office.
Other serious matters need to be clarified. Senator Reynolds refused to say on Tuesday if and when she told Scott Morrison’s office about the alleged rape. The Prime Minister says he was advised that his office became aware of the allegations of a sexual assault last Friday, February 12, and that he personally did not know about them until Monday morning. Understandably, Mr Morrison said on Wednesday that he was not happy that Senator Reynolds failed to tell him for nearly two years. But The Australian understands a meeting occurred in early April 2019 in which a former Liberal staff member and colleague of Ms Higgins told a senior adviser to Mr Morrison about the alleged assault. As Mr Morrison told the Coalition partyroom on Tuesday, the alleged incident is a “wake-up call” about the treatment of women in federal parliament. Rape, a serious criminal offence, is in a different sphere to problems of workplace culture, bullying and bad behaviour, although respect for others and decency are at the heart of such matters. Many also would argue that a workplace culture hostile to women creates conditions that can increase the likelihood of sexual harassment, sexual assaults and rape. For that reason, the review by West Australian Liberal MP Celia Hammond, a former Notre Dame vice-chancellor, of the Coalition parties’ complaints handling processes and workplace culture will be worthwhile. So is the inquiry by Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet deputy secretary Stephanie Foster about how parliamentary staff can be better supported. The political ramifications of the drama are potentially enormous. But at its centre is the alleged rape of a young woman in the national parliament who has been brave to speak out. There is no justification for covering up allegedly serious crimes, regardless of where they occur.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
The grievance industry is making a dill of itself	The Australian	Another day, another epistle from the church of the perpetually aggrieved. Shaad D’Souza wants the word colonial abolished from commercial activity in the context of a hopelessly culturally unaware brewery operation even though he deems this campaign to be “stupid” (“Colonial ale deemed beyond the pale”, 17/6).
Will he extend his campaign to having the word disappear from social discourse entirely? Perhaps create a modern day puritanical version of an index of forbidden words and books? He will be a busy man as he travels through the jungle of decadent Western civilisation hunting for inappropriate, socially unaware wildlife.
I cannot wait for his next targets to be exposed — perhaps the name Australia itself will be in his righteous sights. Anyhow, I’m signing up for a case of beer before the management at Colonial caves in.
And the cancel culture warriors are devouring their own over Coon cheese. Delicious.
Ashley Georgeson, Adelaide, SA In regards to activists calling for the beer brand Colonial to be dumped after activists called for it, it’s sad to see businesses caving in to small groups of left extremists. When will it stop? We’re not living in those historic times. If people can’t accept history for what it was, a chance to learn and grow, without seeking to suppress or destroy it, then the coming generations have no hope.
Besides, you wipe history out and hey, it never happened. Ever think of that? If you destroy everything you don’t agree with, you destroy everything we know. What’s next? The Egyptian pyramids because they were made by slave labour?
People need to learn to function side-by-side in a world that is millions of years old in history, both good and bad. We need to respect each other — culture, history, opinions and ideas.
Angela Verdenius, Geraldton, WA The attack on Colonial ale is the latest example of Australia kowtowing to minority radicals that are destroying our culture.
Unless good people stand up now, as they do at election time, who knows where this growing idiocy will end; maybe like the US where a campaign to destroy the police is under way.
Melbourne’s leftist Darebin Council, having already cancelled its Australia Day, is now polling to remove historic statues. Where does it end?
Alan Chipp, Hawthorn East, Vic I realise this demonstrates my ignorance and bigotry, but what’s offensive in saying that blackface has no cultural­ relevance in Australia (“Been cancelled in culture wars? Tough cheese”, 17/6)? Is it the term blackface? Is it the claim that it has no cultural relevance? Has the comment committed the sin of culturally appropriating a discredited aspect of American culture?
It’s very challenging trying to keep up with the requirements of cultural purity; I’m not sure I’m up to it.
Susan Caughey, Glen Iris, Vic My European ancestors suffered thousands of years of invasions, wars, murder, rape, torture, pestilence, starvation from the likes of the Romans, Alexander the Great, Attila the Hun, the Vikings, Genghis Khan, the Mongols, the Christians, the Muslims, several crusades, warring kings, queens, popes, prophets and Nazis.
It seems the Aboriginal people of this country should revere the arrival of the British and be grateful they were only invaded once.
Ron Webb, Bentley Park, Qld Desecrating a symbol such as a statue of James Cook cannot destroy the history it represents. A defaced statue becomes a contemporary symbol with an entirely different meaning, hijacked by protesters to draw attention to themselves and discontent in an evolving culture. Defacing of monuments indicates a level of discontent that should be addressed in the interests of a cohesive society.
Roslyn Smith, Middle Park, Qld If we accept that we still live in a democracy, why are governments, corporations and councils allowing a minority of radical activists to shape how we view our history and how products are marketed?
In civilised society, change comes about through persuasive argument and the ballot box, not through a cancel culture. Activists who use these misguided methods should realise they are alienating quiet Australians who will, once again, make their presence felt at the next federal election.Randal Williams, Burnside, SA	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
ALP must trim sails on spending	The Australian	Anthony Albanese is right to ditch one of Labor’s big tax measures
It has taken 20 months. But, better late than never, Anthony Albanese has learned one of the big lessons of the 2019 May election. The Opposition Leader has killed off one of Bill Shorten’s most foolish policies and promised to make no changes to retired Australians’ franking credits refunds. If the pledge marks a shift away from the high tax-and-spend agenda Labor adopted in the lead-up to the last election, the nation will be better for it. Post-COVID, as Peter Costello said last week, it will be important to retire debt before interest rates rise, increasing the burden on taxpayers. We are already facing a post-COVID budget deficit of $197.7bn this financial year and gross debt of more than $1 trillion later in the decade.
If the opposition is to establish economic credibility, it will need to also curtail its massive spending promises on health and education. Labor’s franking credits overhaul, which the Parliamentary Budget Office found could impact on more than 200,000 self-managed super funds, was expected to recoup about $6bn annually in revenue. That is a big gap to fill. In the lead-up to the next election, which could be held later this year, as Dennis Shanahan writes on Monday, it will not be good enough for either side to hide behind cheap credit to buy votes by promising fresh spending sprees.
Mr Albanese will be hoping to blunt any attempts by Scott Morrison and the Coalition to rerun their successful campaign claiming the franking credits policy was a “Labor retirees’ tax”. That is good politics. But it remains to be seen whether Labor MPs back Mr Albanese by working with him to trim Labor’s extravagant spending promises as well as its taste for higher taxes.
Two days ago, frontbencher Tanya Plibersek tweeted that 2020 had shown “what’s possible, like wage subsidies, childcare, increased jobseeker support and housing the homeless’’.
She called for “a better, stronger, fairer Australia’’ in the wake of the COVID crisis. However appealing the sentiment to fans of big government, the Morrison team’s COVID measures were a once-in-a-century response to a once-in-a-century health crisis. After the pandemic, the continuation of borrowing and spending for major recurrent social programs would be unaffordable and irresponsible.
Mr Albanese has promised that after the March ALP national conference, he will begin a bigger rollout of economic policies focused on job creation and lifting productivity. That is the part of the debate on economic reform that the nation needs.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Partisan politics slips out of temporary self-isolation	The Australian	Anthony Albanese would have blown up national cabinet
No matter social-distancing rules or restrictions on gatherings, politicians revert to type. In our robust democracy, they accentuate differences, bicker and form factions. It’s in their DNA: Do Not Agree. We wish leaders would set aside cudgels and look to the common good. The coronavirus pandemic provides an opportunity for politicians to do so; if they can’t be better, they should try to be different, if only temporarily. On Monday, at a subdued and efficient sitting of parliament, Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese eloquently addressed the scale of the health, social and economic turmoil of COVID-19. The Prime Minister and Opposition Leader pledged a ceasefire, if only to pass mammoth fiscal rescue measures.
But the truce did not hold. Labor voted for the package, then launched a critique of the Morrison government’s pandemic response. It argued measures were too slow, had too many holes; they needed to be implemented faster, with guarantees for workers. In subsequent days Mr Albanese stepped up criticism, opening new battlefronts. This is his role: to probe, call out inconsistencies, highlight problems, convey the public’s concerns. He should not be shy about offering alternative approaches based on evidence and the advice of experts. On Thursday, Mr Albanese outlined a patchwork plan for post-pandemic Australia. It did not go viral. Labor is focused on the next election — putting down markers, setting traps, running interference. This is a delicate time for political professionals, requiring care, nuance and clarity. Yet Mr Albanese is struggling to find a winning balance between “opposition” and “leader”.
Of course, you can fuse those two words so it’s politics as usual. Or Mr Albanese could find inspiration in a former Labor leader’s calling card: “I’m Anthony, I’m from NSW, the epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, and I’m here to help.” Mr Albanese has raised the temperature by breaking ranks with the national response and personally targeting Mr Morrison. He claims Australia has got it wrong on the key platforms to fight COVID-19: health, economic rescue and messaging. Nonsensically, Mr Albanese said the government had to ensure there was not a tension “between dealing with the health issues and dealing with the economic issues”. But that’s the wicked problem here. He also demanded Mr Morrison listen to experts; the response has been based entirely on advice of top medicos, official family of Treasury and Reserve Bank brains, and discussion within national cabinet. Mr Albanese needs to keep up with the play.
Labor accuses the government of prioritising the economy over health. It should be the other way around, says health spokesman Chris Bowen. “The best economic plan for the country is to beat this virus quickly,” he claims. We should be wary of Mr Bowen’s advice on economic plans; voters rejected his revolutionary schema last May. What is Labor’s prescription for shutdown? Like it or not, doctors are in the vanguard, with advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee at the forefront. There is a mischievous, if not dangerous, view that a short, sharp shutdown of two to four weeks would beat COVID-19. Mr Morrison has flatly rejected a scorched-earth approach. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy describes such daft restrictions as “destroying life as we know it”.
Officials concede there are “two schools of thought” on how to respond to the outbreak. The AHPPC has opted for a scaleable model of increasing restrictions through stages. Others, including Victorian advisers, are in favour of a so-called “go hard and go fast” approach. But as deputy CMO Nick Coatsworth said on Thursday, it was all about degrees. “We’ve gone hard and fast,” he said. “To say that we’ve gone light and slow would be completely inaccurate. The measures that we’ve got in at the moment are unprecedented.” Mr Albanese and egotist pundits are aware harsher restrictions are on the way; they are craving limelight and relevance.
Labor also accuses Mr Morrison of confused messaging. The amended restrictions on hairdressers and funerals, announced on Thursday, gave that impression. It is policy on the run to some extent. But these are matters for national cabinet; Mr Morrison is the frontman who explains an expanding array of cascading rules signed off by premiers and chief ministers. Given states and territories are moving to different settings, including likely lockdowns of specific locales, there will be times when there is new information overload. Making matters worse is a lack of compliance and individuals stirring up sediment on rules, schools and services; businesses are creating bespoke restrictions, passing them off to customers and staff as “the law”. Amid this turbidity, Labor pounces.Mr Morrison was right to exclude the Labor leader from the nine-member national cabinet. Imagine the solidarity, already frayed on some issues, if an interloper — with grievances and no direct responsibility — were in the tent. If it keeps this up, federal Labor can’t be part of the COVID-19 solution. Yet the more turmoil and carnage, the better its chances of winning an election. It’s a brutal calculus, but that’s power politics. The Coalition faced a similar equation during the global financial crisis; this calamity has no comparator. Labor’s new manifesto touts a Boris Johnson-style wage subsidy, workplace changes, much more social housing and a bigger welfare state. So, while the national cabinet is in a life-and-death struggle with a pandemic, Mr Albanese is still fighting local Tories while mixing the pop and policies of British ones.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
The lessons of Auschwitz must never be forgotten	The Australian	Anti-Semitism is rapidly on the rise, from left and right
Seventy-five years ago the world slowly awakened to the horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau as Soviet troops liberated the largest Nazi death camp in occupied southwestern Poland. In Australia, the gruesome discovery was marked in our newspapers via a snippet from Reuters, understated and naive in retrospect. It noted a “terrible concentration camp” had been captured at Oswiecim, where “tens of thousands of people were tortured” and “thousands more were shot”. In reality, as Henry Ergas wrote on Monday, 1.1 million people were killed at Auschwitz, of whom 960,000 were Jews. Here, a world away, the scale of the crimes against humanity only began to become apparent months later as other camps were liberated and newsreels were released, showing images of piled corpses, gaunt survivors, gas chambers, and rooms full of human hair and books bound in human skin.
The Shoah is passing from living memory. About half the remaining Holocaust survivors have died in just the past five years. Fiona Harari has interviewed Australian survivors, including twin sisters Annetta Able and Stephanie Heller. At Auschwitz they were forced to load naked corpses on to trucks and were subjected to Josef Mengele’s barbaric medical experiments. Life was measured in minutes. “You hoped to get out alive,” Mrs Able said. Ergas wrote of “the morning hangings, the specially designed benches on which inmates were whipped until every bone was broken, the cages in which prisoners were starved to death, the operating theatres where children were deliberately infected with disease, the gas chambers and crematoriums”.
Auschwitz must inform the world today as it confronts signs of a revival in anti-Semitism, with even the guides at the Bergen-Belsen camp reporting being heckled by Holocaust deniers. There is, as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned, “a global crisis of anti-Semitic hatred, a constant stream of attacks targeting Jews, their institutions and property”. Last year there was a 21 per cent increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes in New York, of all places, with its large Jewish population. In France there was a 74 per cent rise in anti-Semitic attacks. In Britain they rose by 16 per cent to a record high as anti-Semitism gained traction within the heart of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour. Incredibly, after a spate of attacks on synagogues, a German government minister was so alarmed he warned Jews not to go out on to the streets wearing a kippah (religious cap). In Australia, intolerance and ignorance are behind a rising number of anti-Semitic incidents.
A UN report on anti-Semitism warned the resurgence was being fuelled by both the extreme right and extreme left — typically under the cover of anti-Israel rhetoric — and violent Islamist extremism. As former Israeli minister Natan Sharansky pointed out, global anti-Semitism from both left and right has morphed from targeting Jews simply because they are Jews, to targeting Israel and all the Jewish state stands for as it seeks to survive as the only democracy amid the hostility and hatred of the Middle East.
Yet the world collectively does little. As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pointed out at the World Holocaust Forum: “We have yet to see a unified and resolute stance against the most anti-Semitic regime on the planet — a regime that openly seeks to develop nuclear weapons and annihilate the one and only Jewish state.” He was, of course, referring to Iran, and he called on the world to join in “confronting the tyrants of Tehran”. The world, however, has remained largely unmoved by his pleas, with Europe, in particular, more than happy to go on dealing with Tehran. In her book How to Fight Anti-Semitism, Bari Weiss, a writer from Pittsburgh, where 11 Jews were gunned down while praying at the Tree of Life Synagogue in October 2018, warns “the world’s oldest hatred” is “migrating towards the mainstream, amplified by social media and a culture of conspiracy”.
In January 1945, Soviet soldiers on the spot were revolted by the “crime without precedent” at Auschwitz. But the Holocaust was not an aberration. Tragically, we have again witnessed genocide, with hundreds of thousands of people killed in Rwanda, Darfur and Myanmar. Ergas wondered what evils mankind reserves for the future. “What we do know is that the moral strength to think for ourselves remains as precious and as threatened as ever,” he wrote, noting the growing pressures to bow to mass opinion and the hysteria assailing those who dare question the self-images of the age.Auschwitz is not only a symbol of monstrous inhumanity, the miserable epitome of what Hannah Arendt termed the “banality of evil”, but must also remain a rallying point to prevent genocide. As the number of survivors dwindles by the day, ritual is replacing memory on such anniversaries. To honour them and those exterminated by Nazis not so long ago, for the sake of our common humanity and peace among peoples the lessons of the Shoah must never fade.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Reopen borders for prosperity	The Australian	Any easing of restrictions is welcome but we need far more
The limited easing of border restrictions for rural workers in NSW and Queensland is a welcome acknowledgment that rigid, city-focused COVID-19 rules are unwise and unworkable. Much remains to be done, however, to avoid the creation of a mishmash of different rules between various jurisdictions that might look good to bureaucrats but make no sense out bush. Rather than small-picture exemptions, the focus must be on how to lift border restrictions safely everywhere to allow the economy to operate unrestricted across the federation. Government declarations that jobs are the top priority must be more than lip service given the dire warnings being offered by business.
Flight Centre managing director Graham Turner has added his voice to concerns in these pages, pointing out Queensland and Tasmania have economies and workforces heavily reliant on tourism, travel events and hospitality. As we learn to live with COVID-19, he argues, these states desperately need borders open.
There has been a big difference in approaches taken by Victoria and Queensland on cross-border movement related to agriculture. Victoria’s border bubble allows farmers and critical agricultural workers who reside outside the border region zone in Victoria to travel up to 100km within NSW. They must provide a highly specialised critical agricultural service and self-isolate when not doing this work.
Farmers along the NSW and Queensland border will fare slightly better under new, somewhat relaxed rules. They will not be limited to operating within 100km of the border but will face limits on time and the actions they are permitted to undertake. The limited travel approvals will not apply to seasonal workers. Farmers and agribusiness workers must travel directly to and from the relevant farm or premises without stopping.
As the Business Council of Australia has warned, the rapid and piecemeal implementation of complex and inconsistent domestic border restrictions is affecting families, destroying jobs and crippling the Australian economy’s ability to recover from the pandemic. The BCA correctly emphasises that inconsistent state- and territory-based rules ignore the reality of the way small and large businesses operate across borders and how we live our lives.
Following the national cabinet get-together on Friday, Scott Morrison said an agricultural workers code was being prepared to be considered at the next meeting. The code will provide for a nationally consistent approach covering individuals with occupations deemed critical to ensure the continuity of the agricultural sector. It is to be hoped the framework will reverse the approach taken so far by Victoria and Queensland. Rather than focus on the sorts of limited technical exceptions outlined in those jurisdictions, the national code must work from the position of maximum flexibility for border communities and the agriculture sector as a whole. As advocated by the BCA, the national cabinet needs to agree to a nationwide framework that clearly sets out the thresholds for when internal border controls can be implemented and how they would apply. The goal should be to free up movement to capitalise on welcome winter rains and get the economy back on track.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
We say Towards level 3 and the ‘recovery room’	The New Zealand Herald	Any move to the lower level would be about consolidating the gains made in alert level 4, not risking reversing them.
New Zealanders wake up this morning to another weekend in lockdown. Another weekend that has come to look remarkably similar to the rest of the week — and the weeks and weekends before it — for the house-bound majority. But this weekend there is a difference; this weekend could be the country’s last in alert level 4.
On Monday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her Cabinet will make a decision about whether to lift or extend the nationwide lockdown from this Thursday — a month after it was implemented in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19 and eradicate it from our shores.
On Thursday, a week ahead of that teasing, possible new-dawn horizon, the Prime Minister broadly outlined what life after lockdown would look like — for individuals, the education sector, businesses and industry.
It seems clear, however — and both Ardern and Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield were at pains to emphasise — alert level 3 will still look a lot like lockdown.
Any move to the lower alert level — and it is certainly not a fait accompli by any means — would be about consolidating the gains made in alert level 4, not risking reversing them. Any changes would not mean tolerating an increase in Covid-19 cases or more deaths from the virus.
Ardern said “level 3 is a progression, not a rush to normality”.
So, in large part, the same or similar measures of the past month will continue to apply.
In some ways it might be the hardest level for the country to sit at. There will be the feeling among the general public that things should be different, yet the reality many frustrating and upsetting restrictions remain in place, and the risk of transmission of the virus still high.
While indicating the importance of getting some businesses and education facilities back in operation, the message remains: while we are “over the peak”, we are by no means “out of the woods”.
Bloomfield says the lower alert level actually means “increased vigilance” is needed by everyone.
To this effect, we will need to dampen down expectations somewhat.
On an individual level, while we may now be able to go for a swim, surf, mountain bike or day walk, we still need to do these things alone or only with people from our bubble. Any signs of public “congregating” will be clamped down on, and activities that carry risk — such as hunting and boating or anything “motorised” — are still banned.
While we may be able to expand our “bubble” slightly in some cases, it is clearly too soon for heartfelt reunions with friends, loved ones and the extended whānau. The message is still to keep our bubbles “small and exclusive”.
This may offer more contact for the elderly, for whom it is acknowledged loneliness may be taking a toll, but there is still clearly a need to protect them and people with compromised immunity, so maintaining strict hygiene and social distancing will still be vital.
There is partial relaxation around life events such as funerals/tangi and weddings, but they must be restricted to no more than 10 people, services only, and no associated functions.
While children up to year 10 can go back to early childhood centres and schools if necessary, the message is still for parents to keep kids online learning at home if possible. Those who do make it into the classroom will find new bubble rules will apply, playtimes will look different, and parents are likely to be dissuaded from gas-bagging at the school gates as social isolating rules still apply — 2m in general, 1m for settings where contacts can be easily traced.
Public playgrounds are still a no-no, as there is still a high risk of transmitting the virus on frequently-touched equipment.
Businesses and industry will get the much-needed green light to resume operations in an cautious effort to open up the economy, but again only in some cases and only if operators can adhere to safety, hygiene and social-distancing measures.
While this will be welcome relief for tradespeople, and those in the likes of the forestry and construction sectors, there will still be severe limitations for retail and hospitality. So, while we can now grab a drive-through takeaway, it will still be some time before we can go out with a group of mates to a bar, cafe or restaurant, or to the mall.
When it comes to travel, the message would change from “stay local” to “stay regional”.
Overall, the message is still one of “staying home” if possible, of social distancing, and of using our judgment.
The messages from both Bloomfield and Ardern are: “Don’t push things to the maximum of what you can do, keep contact to a minimum.” “Fundamentally, the more distance, the better.” “Continue to act like you have Covid and to act like those around you or near you have Covid.”
Cabinet won’t make the decision to move the country down to alert level 3 lightly. If it does opt for level 3, there will be a high level of trust, responsibility and common sense placed on all New Zealanders. We must “use our judgment”, continue to be precautionary, and rise to the occasion. We need to hang in there — in what the PM calls the “waiting room” or the “recovery room” — in order to get back out there — into normal life — as soon as possible.
If we can do that, if we can be patient for just a while longer, if we can continue to reduce the number of cases and community transmission, retain confidence in our testing, contact tracing and quarantine measures, there is much to be (cautiously) optimistic about.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
China’s ominous media purge	The Australian	Apple Daily readers are voting with their feet and wallets Beijing’s inflammatory propaganda machine regards Jimmy Lai, the 71-year-old billionaire Hong Kong media tycoon arrested on Monday, as a “dangerous traitor” hellbent on inciting a “colour revolution” in the territory. In reality, he is a rags-to-riches businessman and newspaper publisher who is Hong Kong’s most effective pro-democracy advocate on the world stage. His humiliating arrest and incarceration on Monday confirms the Chinese Communist Party’s desperation to snuff out what few vestiges remain of free expression and democratic dissent in the disaffected former British colony.
Mr Lai was taken from his home in handcuffs, then paraded through the Apple Daily newsroom as more than 200 armed police stormed through the building, searching reporters’ desks and carting away dozens of files. Mr Lai eventually was taken away with his sons and seven others. He faces vaguely defined charges under Hong Kong’s draconian new security law involving alleged “collusion with foreign powers”. He could face life in prison after a trial by judges appointed by the CCP. Of all the developments in Hong Kong since the CCP cancelled elections for a new legislative assembly, few deserve greater international condemnation than Mr Lai’s arrest. It was no surprise given his influence over the pro-democracy movement.
With polls continuing to show unfailing support among most people in Hong Kong for the democracy movement, Beijing sees it as crucial to put an end to his publishing enterprises, which have done so much to uphold the traditions of press freedom against the communist juggernaut.
Beijing has never disguised its fury over the access Mr Lai enjoyed to leaders such as US Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But in a sign of how out of touch President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders are in their attempts to subjugate Hong Kong, Tuesday’s front page of the tabloid Apple Daily recommitted the paper firmly to the struggle for democracy, declaring “Apple Daily Must Fight On”.
Readers were undaunted. They queued in the early hours to buy copies of the paper, which increased its daily print run from 100,000 to 500,000. Shares in Mr Lai’s media company, Next Digital, which publishes Apple Daily, soared as investors responded to calls on pro-democracy online forums for them to invest as a show of support. Mr Lai’s arrest is further confirmation of how far Beijing has strayed from the “one-country, two-systems” arrangement it committed itself to at the time of the British handover in 1997. It is imperative the world does not abandon the people of Hong Kong in the face of an escalating drive by Beijing to ride roughshod over freedoms they were promised. Difficult days lie ahead of Mr Lai and Hong Kong’s democrats. As the CCP silences them, it is all the more important for the world to speak out for them.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
RBG’s death sparks battle royal	The Australian	Appointing a new judge will now be a major campaign issue
Donald Trump wants “no delay” in replacing the influential liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the nine-member bench of the powerful US Supreme Court. Her death from cancer at the age of 87 has unleashed a titanic battle, with big implications for November’s election, especially if the court has to rule on any dispute, as it did in 2000 between George W Bush and Al Gore over Florida ballots.
Before she died Justice Ginsburg said: “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.” But Mr Trump has the constitutional power to nominate a replacement whenever he likes. Doing so now offers an opportunity to fulfil his promise to enshrine a conservative majority on the bench for a generation. That prospect fired up his support base in 2016. His reported frontrunner is Amy Coney Barrett, 48, a Catholic mother of seven who is reportedly anti-abortion and anti-same-sex marriage.
With a conservative majority, Cameron Stewart reports, the Supreme Court would be more supportive of Mr Trump on gun rights, religious freedom, and free speech and more hostile to abortion, anti-discrimination laws and immigration. But he needs to be cautious. As much as enshrining a 6-3 majority would energise his base, it is also likely to energise Democrat voters at a time he is trailing Joe Biden by 7 per cent in most polls. At seven million US cases and 200,000 deaths, Mr Trump’s handling of COVID-19 weighs heavily on his chances. Campaigning on the court could divert attention. Democrats are claiming “gross hypocrisy” over the rush. Republican senators in 2016 refused a vote on Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland, insisting it be left to whoever won the election. This time, some Senate Republicans also want a replacement left to the winner in November, and note Mr Trump’s 2018 nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh took three months to pass the Senate.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
The Earth breathed again with a reset EDITORIAL	Wanganui Chronicle	Are we there yet?
No, but you could be forgiven for thinking coming down a rung was Level free.
People were really disappointed because we’re all doing our bit, but there were cracks.
There was a rush on takeaways and some just left their rubbish out — granted it was on top of a public bin.
But here’s something we could all do, and that’s take our rubbish home. Your rubbish, your responsibility.
For many, this has been a time of reflection, of reset.
We were reminded of the important lessons of this time. One is hygiene — wash your hands. I’m amazed that a simple action learned in early childhood has to be reminded. It’s always the first thing I do when I enter my home. And remove your damned footwear at the door.
I went to the supermarket on Sunday, yes, for more cat food. I chose not to wear my Vietnamese cloth mask for the first time in lockdown. I’ve been reading that the open space of a supermarket and the length of time one spends indoors is likely to not be where you can pick up Covid-19. However, it felt like another free-for-all so I’ll be wearing my full kit next visit.
Five weeks in lockdown I’ve managed to ‘clean the corners’ in my home, Zoom in to Pilates online with my niece in Bali, and catch up on music I listened to in my teens — Yvonne Elliman who was in Jesus Christ Superstar, Herbie Mann and Duane Allman — and dance. Dancing chases away any blues. However, playing my music to a danceable level irked Puddy. It was a day when I thought lockdown wasn’t going so well. It was the death-stare, if I understood Puddy’s countenance.
I know this has been a difficult time for many people but I’ve enjoyed the creativity of how people connected over the internet. Others have relished the time to tackle those unfinished jobs. Judging by the queues at some of the stores prior to lockdown, a lot of painting was on the agenda for households. But through all the mayhem, I was heartened that the Earth was given a lifeline. Pollution levels decreased on the planet and animals returned to spaces. NZME’s Go Local! campaign is an opportunity for our collective reset, to truly support local businesses and Made in New Zealand. By doing so we are also ensuring the Earth continues to breathe.

Time will tell	Herald on Sunday	As New Zealand prepares to exit alert level 4 lockdown and take its first tentative steps towards a new normal, it is timely to reflect on the tests, trials and triumphs of the past unprecedented month.
It seems likely history will judge New Zealand’s initial response to the pandemic favourably. The Government’s decision to “go hard and go early”, backed by a largely impressive public health response and Kiwis’ strength and determination to stay the course, appears to have paid off — at least in terms of the human cost of the virus.
Our low death toll, while undeniably sad, and our low number of cases, must be considered remarkable in the circumstances, and credit should be given where it is due. Most would surely concur we have had the right leader at the right time in Jacinda Ardern — whom the Atlantic praised as being “possibly the most effective leader on the planet” and a Government whose approach of elimination not just containment has meant “New Zealand isn’t just flattening the curve. It’s squashing it”, as the Washington Post gushed.
The Government’s decisive action and Ardern’s clear, consistent communication and empathy have helped New Zealanders remain calm, comforted and confident. Director general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield has provided a similar level of quiet and informed assurance.
Which other prime minister thought about kids in lockdown and designated the Easter Bunny an essential worker? What other governments will be remembered as instructing citizens to “be kind” as part of their official messaging?
There have been glitches and in terms of the longer-term impact of the crisis, it is early days. We may later look back and feel fortunate in our leadership at crunch time but the long months and years ahead, when strategic thinking and decision making will be vital and a likely global food crisis and severe economic recession await, may prove a far harder row to hoe.
Only time will tell the full story.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Stimulus reaches out to save jobs in real economy	The Australian	As PM says, the hardships ahead must not break our spirit
The new stimulus package announced by Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg on Sunday takes the government’s total economic response to COVID-19 to $189bn so far. Other fiscal measures are likely to follow in coming months, as Finance Minister Mathias Cormann flagged. The government is tackling the challenge with a clear sense of direction and purpose. Several key features of its response are clear. First, it is enormous and generous, edging close to 10 per cent of the nation’s GDP. It is more than double what similar economies such as Canada and South Korea have rolled out so far, catering for expectations that the shock will be “deeper, wider and longer’’ than anticipated originally, as the Treasurer said. Second, the strength of the government’s approach is that it will be delivered within existing structures, in the real economy. Wage subsidies for businesses and underwriting loan guarantees for small and medium enterprises will improve their chances of picking up the pieces and re-employing workers as soon as possible after the coronavirus crisis passes. Third, the package is well structured, to alleviate financial difficulties our most vulnerable Australians are likely to face in the isolation of their own homes. As the Prime Minister said, nobody should have to go through this crisis alone. That is especially important for the elderly, the sick, indigenous people and others in remote areas, the unemployed and those who will lose their jobs as major sectors shut down.
In economic terms, Sunday’s $66bn rescue package, put together at rapid speed given its complexity, addresses the needs of pensioners, the jobless, families whose breadwinners lose their jobs and others on welfare. It makes sense that jobseekers, casual workers and sole traders who experience hardship should be able to access up to $20,000 of their superannuation savings in coming months. The $27bn of super to be put back into workers’ pockets will amount to less than 1 per cent of the $3 trillion in super savings. It is their money as Mr Frydenberg said; they need it now. In line with interest rate cuts, lowering the deeming rate for pensioners was vital. About 900,000 pensioners will be better off as a result. A second one-off payment of $750 to welfare recipients and veterans will make their spartan existences more comfortable at home, as will the effective doubling of the dole. Jobseekers eligible for the maximum welfare payment will now receive more than $1100 a fortnight. Such generous taxpayer-funded support will see vastly more cash afloat. Its impact on demand is likely to be limited, however, as opportunities to shop or go out become severely limited.
As events unfold, the government will need to be agile in adjusting its economic response as conditions demand. Federal departments, accustomed to minimising welfare fraud, must adjust to the new environment to guard against rorting at taxpayers’ expense. The flexibility of the package will allow it to be scaled down as the economy approaches “the other side’’ of the crisis. It also complements the RBA’s move last week to inject $105bn of liquidity to help banks meet customers’ demands.
Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures, which are being provided. Beyond this emergency, however, the last thing Australia will need will be a more government-dependent culture. The intervention takes the nation, temporarily, closer to a command-and-control economy. The deficits and debt that will flow from such a substantial stimulus are likely to take a decade or more to pay down, creating sustained pressures on government revenue and spending, on business, on households and on jobseekers. The experience is a salutary lesson in the value of building strong budgets in good times.
Depending on the availability of ventilators, medical authorities and governments need to turn their attention to increasing the number available to cater for an anticipated surge of critically ill patients. As Brad Norington and Natasha Robinson report on Monday, if the spread of infection is limited to 20 per cent of the population, regarded as a best-case scenario, even a doubling of the estimated 2023 intensive care beds across the nation fitted with ventilators could fail to meet demand. Increasing the supply is one of the vital measure governments can take to protect those most at risk of the disease, especially the elderly, who have been left to die in overseas nations due to chronic shortages. That scenario would be anathema to Australians. The national cabinet, and its medical advisers must do all their power to avoid it.For the foreseeable future, including the years beyond coronavirus as the economy rebuilds, living standards will depend heavily on the productive economy. The Morrison government’s pitch to business, through wage subsidies, cash injections, loan guarantees and changes to insolvency and bankruptcy rules, is designed to keep businesses — especially small and medium businesses — afloat as much of the economy, including the busiest centres of our largest cities, is shut down. Business groups endorsed the package, as did the welfare lobby. Mr Morrison was frank and upfront with Australians on Sunday. Sacrifices and hardships are upon us. His announcement fostered a sense of direction, leadership and hope.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Stimulus reaches out to save jobs in real economy	The Australian	As PM says, the hardships ahead must not break our spirit
The new stimulus package announced by Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg on Sunday takes the government’s total economic response to COVID-19 to $189bn so far. Other fiscal measures are likely to follow in coming months, as Finance Minister Mathias Cormann flagged. The government is tackling the challenge with a clear sense of direction and purpose. Several key features of its response are clear. First, it is enormous and generous, edging close to 10 per cent of the nation’s GDP. It is more than double what similar economies such as Canada and South Korea have rolled out so far, catering for expectations that the shock will be “deeper, wider and longer’’ than anticipated originally, as the Treasurer said. Second, the strength of the government’s approach is that it will be delivered within existing structures, in the real economy. Wage subsidies for businesses and underwriting loan guarantees for small and medium enterprises will improve their chances of picking up the pieces and re-employing workers as soon as possible after the coronavirus crisis passes. Third, the package is well structured, to alleviate financial difficulties our must vulnerable Australians are likely to face in the isolation of their own homes. As the Prime Minister said, nobody should have to go through this crisis alone. That is especially important for the elderly, the sick, indigenous people and others in remote areas, the unemployed and those who will lose their jobs as major sectors shut down.
The government should now turn its attention to a different kind of spending issue — increasing the number of ventilators for an anticipated surge of critically ill patients in intensive care units. Even if the spread of infection is limited to 20 per cent of the population, regarded as a best-case scenario, even a doubling of the estimated 2023 intensive care beds across the nation fitted with ventilators could fail to meet demand. At this stage, increasing the availability of ventilators is the most important measure governments can take to protect those most at risk of the disease, especially the elderly, who have been left to die in overseas nations such as Italy due to chronic shortages. That scenario would be anathema to Australians. The national cabinet, which is co-ordinating medical supplies at state and federal level, must do all in its power to avoid it.

Universities’ challenging era with less ‘Kool-Aid’	The Australian	As Professor Craven says, vice-chancellors need to ‘speak Coalition’
If retiring Australian Catholic University vice-chancellor Greg Craven does not resume his career as a distinguished constitutional lawyer, he might consider auditioning for a role as a talking head. In a provocative interview on Monday with Richard Ferguson, Professor Craven, master of the pithy phrase, says that without foreign students to feed their “drug addiction” (to revenue), elite Group of 8 institutions might have to accept they are “no longer going to be Manchester United on a good day, you’re going to be Wolverhampton Wanderers’’. His biggest concern, he says, is that Go8 vice-chancellors will want to “cannibalise’’ the student cohort of “good, mid-tier universities’’ and “decide Year 12s with ATARS of 65 are now splendid chaps’’. We hope not. For the sake of scholarship, academic rigour and the calibre of the nation’s future professionals, especially classroom teachers, the Go8 should keep the entry bar high. And other institutions, especially those with entry scores languishing in the 50s, would do well to lift it. Not everybody who aspires to a university degree is well suited to tertiary study. Trades training, apprenticeships and on-the-job-experience are better preparation for many people for life in the real economy.
However splendid the students of “good mid-tier universities’’, the average ATAR entry scores in 2020 for ACU (63) and Southern Cross University (66) were far removed from the averages of universities such as Melbourne (92.23), Sydney (85.45) NSW (83.67) and ANU (82). With or without high numbers of international students, the hallmark of Australian universities must be academic quality. Given limited taxpayer resources and the reluctance of politicians, universities and students to lift HECS, it would make sense, if cuts are needed, to limit research to those universities with the strongest research records.
Beneath the bravado, Professor Craven has a serious message that some of Australia’s universities could be set to drop out of the world’s top 100 higher education rankings. He believes the “old system of relying on international students is over, it’s finished”. That remains to be seen. Post-COVID-19, assuming the vaccines being rolled out are safe and effective, students will want to study abroad again. And Australia has more to offer than most nations, provided our tertiary sector retains its reputation for excellence. Pandering to the market or lowering the bar in terms of English proficiency in order to rebuild the numbers of overseas students quickly would undermine the sector. Maintaining academic freedom, including the rights of scholars to question or reject prevailing norms of political correctness in contentious areas, also matters. The blinkered, narrow approach of some universities has been clear in recent years in controversies over Chinese-backed Confucius Institutes, Danish economist Bjorn Lomborg’s futile efforts to set up a centre in Australia, James Cook University’s sacking of outspoken physicist Peter Ridd and problems encountered by the Ramsay Centre on various campuses. To Professor Craven’s credit, ACU is offering a new Ramsay-backed BA degree in Western Civilisation. ACU has also spread its footprint during his tenure, to Bankstown, Adelaide and Rome. Professor Craven is right when he says the Chinese market for student places in Australia is collapsing. Universities have become overly reliant on it. In 2018 the University of Sydney, for example, drew 39 per cent of its students from overseas. And of those, 69 per cent were from China. Others have recognised the same concern about over-reliance on the Chinese market — or “drinking the Kool-Aid’’, as another experienced vice-chancellor describes it. Like other export sectors, universities will need to diversify their markets this year.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Selfish call on grim Covid day	The Australian	As Victoria struggles, upping the risk in NSW is dangerous On Australia’s deadliest day of the coronavirus pandemic so far, it was a selfish, unconscionable call by a group supposedly dedicated to improving human rights and the lives of black, disadvantaged Australians. In the context of the news of the day, the NSW Supreme Court’s ruling in favour of the bid by the state’s police to stop the planned Black Lives Matter rally in Sydney’s CBD on Tuesday was eminently sensible. But protest organiser Padraic Gibson’s pledge to push ahead with the event, regardless of the outcome of the movement’s court appeal, was grossly irresponsible. Had the movement suspended street demonstrations until the COVID-19 crisis was over, it might have won new respect. Now, its credibility is in tatters.
In Victoria on Sunday, Premier Daniel Andrews announced 10 more deaths from coronavirus, including a man in his 40s and seven nursing home residents. There were 459 new cases, 228 people in hospital and 42 in intensive care. Of those in intensive care, 10 people are under 50; two in their 20s, two in their 30s and six in their 40s. As Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos says: “This is not an older person’s disease.’’ Sydney, which recorded 14 new cases, has no room for complacency either, with Premier Gladys Berejiklian conceding NSW could be on a “similar path to Victoria”. Against that background, if Tuesday’s Black Lives Matter protest proceeds, attendees who break social distancing rules, and the organisers, should be fined. Such events are not risk-free. As we reported 12 days ago, Victorian health authorities confirmed a link between two cases in people who attended the BLM protest in Melbourne’s CBD in June and a cluster of 240 cases in public housing towers in the city’s inner northwest.
After almost three weeks’ lockdown across metropolitan Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire — costing the national economy about $1bn a week — Victorians potentially face an extension of the lockdown beyond the scheduled end date, August 19. The second outbreak of the virus is an “unfolding tragedy that is hard to get your head around”, as Victoria’s Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, says. At least, as Mr Andrews says, the caseload is not doubling and redoubling every few days, as it has in some places overseas.
The Andrews government needed to reboot its messaging and has done so. Dramatic as it is, the multi-language campaign launched on Saturday, in which a virus survivor says his experience was “like drowning’’, has potential to cut through. Last week, Mr Andrews lamented the failure of many Victorians to follow basic instructions on isolating after taking a coronavirus test and waiting for results. At the same time, delays reported by some people in receiving COVID-19 test results — more than a week in some cases — are not conducive to people following best practice. Challenging as the outbreak is, with more than 40,000 tests carried out a day, health authorities, backed up by ADF and interstate assistance, need to concentrate on speeding up testing and further improving contact tracing.
Victoria’s second surge has struck 40 nursing homes, including residents of St Basil’s Homes for the Aged in the northern Melbourne suburb of Fawkner. So far, the facility has seen 78 cases. As Remy Varga reports on Monday, families of residents are desperate for information about loved ones, after the operator was forced to relinquish control of the facility to the federal government last week. That frustrating lack of information must be remedied immediately. The elderly are acutely vulnerable to the virus. And Victoria’s second wave has shown up many of the problems in the neglected aged-care sector, in which poorly paid, largely casual staff are believed to be responsible for spreading the virus. As Josh Frydenberg says, Victoria’s COVID fight is crucial to the national economy, of which the state comprises a quarter. The problem belongs not only to our second-largest state, but also to the nation. It is crucial that others take reasonable steps to avoid outbreaks in their jurisdictions. For a start, Sydney’s BLM demonstrators need to stay home on Tuesday.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Higher hill to climb after virus battle	The New Zealand Herald	As any tramper knows, few things are more dispiriting than slogging up what should be the final slope, only to discover there’s a higher ridge still to climb.
So it is with the fight against Covid-19. While we’re working our way uphill, hoping the skyline ahead really is the summit, when we get there we’re going to face another uphill battle — against climate change and environmental degradation.
Given what the world is going through, it would be tempting to ignore that next struggle. After all, we’re spending all our money right now, coping with the immediate danger. What resources will we have left to fight another risk that, so far, is mostly over the horizon? And anyway, haven’t businesses, farmers and ordinary taxpayers suffered enough, without incurring the extra cost of averting climate calamity?
But while the coronavirus battle is right here and right now, nothing has changed about the need to reduce the harm humankind is doing to the environment. Shutdowns have delivered a brief respite in greenhouse gas emissions, but it’s only a blip in a rising trend. And the more successful economic stimulus packages are, the more likely it is that emissions will rise again.
Costly as coronavirus is, the danger is that decades from now that cost could seem insignificant compared with the cost of climate change — in deaths caused by heatwaves, the spread of tropical diseases, famine resulting from changing weather patterns, and rising sea levels.
If some of those dangers can seem remote from NZ, the economic costs of climate change are less easy to ignore. It’s easy for city dwellers to forget, but we’ve just had a reminder of those risks, in the drought which disrupted farming in many regions.
Past droughts have cost this country billions of dollars a year. That’s not in the same league as the cost of the coronavirus battle, but it doesn’t take a vivid imagination to fear the impact of a succession of severe droughts. Or a string of major storms. Or Australian-scale bushfires. Or new agricultural pests, making themselves at home as the country gets warmer.
While it’s never possible to say with certainty that this drought or that storm was the result of man-made climate change, it is possible to say that climate change makes more unseasonal weather more likely. As a nation that relies on agriculture — suddenly, even more than we already did — the danger is obvious.
In 2014, the World Health Organisation estimated climate change would lead to about 250,000 extra deaths globally per year between 2030 and 2050.
Individuals can make a difference, and maybe some habits learned in lockdown — working from home, flying less — will help. But in the end, government action is the only thing that will get us up that next slope. Whatever the scale of the current crisis, governments can’t escape the need to boost efforts to combat climate change, keep exhorting others to do the same, and make sure stimulus-funded projects don’t lock us into an even higher-emissions future.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics

Low productivity, meat pies, kangaroos, not Holden cars	The Australian	As one era ends, we need to set our sights for higher growth
The decision by General Motors to retire the Holden name from sales is a sad occasion. With its roots in an 1850s Adelaide saddlery, then production of carriages, motorcycle sidecars and, eventually, a Port Melbourne factory turning out “Australia’s own car”, Holden will perhaps be the most iconic local brand to disappear. Our vehicle industry was sheltered behind the tariff wall for decades. Once Bob Hawke and Paul Keating started dismantling industry protection in the 1980s, the writing was on the proverbial wall for Holden, Ford, Toyota and Mitsubishi. The adjustment was not easy for the manufacturers or workers, especially out of the early 90s recession. But taxpayers softened the blow, funding assistance packages worth $30bn in the 15 years to the time Canberra blew the whistle. In 2017 Holden’s last vehicle factory, in Elizabeth, South Australia, was closed, leaving behind a design and engineering centre at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne that will close next year.
It was money down the drain. As taxpayers have come to learn the hard way, industry assistance delays the day of reckoning. Handouts stop capital and labour going to their most productive uses, which holds back GDP, wages growth and profits. As the Productivity Commission found in its sharp 2014 review of the automotive manufacturing industry, protection “dulls the incentives for firms to improve productivity, seek export opportunities, cease unsuccessful investments and diversify into other industries”. The economy-wide costs do not justify the benefits, it concluded.
We can trace today’s weak growth in wages and slowdown in productivity back to failures of policy to make our economy more flexible. There has been a lack of urgency to improve the economy’s supply side. But it is now catching up with us. Wage growth has stalled since 2012. According to the commission, weak productivity is the main driver, as well as the falling labour share of income. The commission looked at the contribution different industries in the market sector made to the labour productivity slowdown — comparing the 30 years before 2005 and the 14 years after — and found manufacturing alone was responsible for half of the slide. Rather than workers getting skills in sectors that pay better (such as in mining) or companies moving into new areas that produce higher returns for shareholders, industry assistance locked in workers and investment to failing car factories.
It’s unsettling to admit, but low productivity has become a part of our national brand, now replacing Holden cars at the end of the jingle “football, meat pies, kangaroos”. Over 20 years, the strong terms of trade — the world giving us a pay rise simply because we’re Aussies — allowed us to sustain solid income growth despite weak productivity. But that model of sky-high export prices is broken. Labour productivity fell by 0.2 per cent last financial year, the first lapse since the peak of the mining boom. Commission chairman Michael Brennan has called for a new national focus from business and political leaders to combat this underperformance. Ideally, it could lead to a new wave of micro-economic reform and innovation.
The productivity debacle has not escaped the preternaturally optimistic Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, who habitually talks up the nation’s “fantastic” economic fundamentals. We have “significant issues” over the longer term, Dr Lowe told the House of Representatives economics committee earlier this month. “The one that worries me most is weak productivity growth,” he said. “I fear that our economy is becoming less dynamic. We have lower rates of investment, lower rates of business formation and lower rate of people switching jobs.” The good doctor reminded MPs that productivity growth was the fountain of sustainable increases in “living standards, real wages, and real asset prices”.
One voice we should listen to is NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet, who on Monday called on Canberra to get on the “tax reform bus” and fix the federation. In a speech at a forum examining the Federal Financial Relations Review — a high-powered independent panel announced last August to help NSW reach financial autonomy — Mr Perrottet put pressure on his federal counterpart to help abolish annoying, counter-productive state taxes. Yet if NSW got rid of property stamp duty and opted for a more efficient land tax, the state would lose $1bn in federal GST revenue.A “grand bargain” among states and the commonwealth that shifts the tax burden towards a broader-based GST or land tax would boost economic growth. But neither Josh Frydenberg nor Labor’s leadership has shown the slightest interest. Better housekeeping on federal-state agreements, increasing states’ incentives to manage funds efficiently and take responsibility for their own policies, would yield huge dividends. As Mr Perrottet argues, we need a national reform agenda. The structural changes of the 80s and 90s have worked their magic, to a point. Getting there required bold policies and strong leadership. As Mr Frydenberg shapes the May budget, we’d like to see more than one-off tax breaks and extra spending on infrastructure. The nation needs business investment, better ideas, skilled workers, less red tape and new icons to replace those on the exit ramp.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
EDITORIALComparing lockdown experiences is unfair	Hawkes Bay Today	As parents, teachers and children come to grips with a new way of school life this week it’s important to acknowledge no family can be living the same experience right now.
Term two starts tomorrow, nearly three weeks after New Zealand went into alert level 4 lockdown in a bid to fight Covid-19. We have just over a week of that initial four-week lockdown period left, with a decision on whether it will be extended due April 20.
Until then, there is no way of knowing how long children will be learning from home or what life after lockdown really looks like and the thought that some schools could open to some students in just a few weeks seems surreal.
Schooling will be different to anything anyone has experienced from this week and we’d be silly not to expect a few teething problems.
But the key thing to remember is that no family can be living the same experience during this lockdown so there can’t be a blanket approach to education at this time.
Family situations are different. Some families are dealing with the stresses of uncertainty around employment, some are using the level 4 lockdown as some downtime and a chance to enjoy quality time together, some families have expanded to include grandparents and extended family members in their bubbles and some parents are doing it all alone, while working or not.
But lockdown experiences go beyond the number of people in your family and the support you do or don’t have. The amount of space you have in your home and outside it has to be a factor as well.
This is why parents can’t be hard on themselves. When schooling starts they can’t compare themselves to other parents or expect the same result, and they can’t approach their “home school” in the same way. Each household will be different and families need to adjust to what suits them best.
And just as students and their parents are facing challenges, it’s important to acknowledge that teachers and staff will be dealing with some of the same issues as the rest of us.
We can’t expect them to give us the same level of engagement in a virtual environment as they would in a normal setting. Everyone’s wellbeing needs to be taken into account.
This school term is an unconventional one. It will be a term of adapting — and that alone provides plenty of learning opportunities for everyone.
Learning at home is not the same as learning at school. If the biggest lesson children and families take away from this learning from home experience is one of adjusting to a different situation, that can’t be a bad thing.

Term two starts tomorrow, nearly three weeks after New Zealand went into alert level 4 lockdown in a bid to fight Covid-19. We have just over a week of that initial four-week lockdown period left, with a decision on whether it will be extended due on April 20.
Until then, there is no way of knowing how long children will be learning from home or what life after lockdown really looks like and the thought that some schools could open to some students in just a few weeks seems surreal.
Schooling will obviously be different to anything anyone has experienced from this week and we’d be silly not to expect a few teething problems along the way.
But the key thing to remember is that no family can be living the same experience during this lockdown so there can’t be a blanket approach to education at this time.
Family situations are different. Some families are dealing with the stresses of uncertainty around employment, some are using the level 4 lockdown as some downtime and a chance to enjoy quality time together, some families have expanded to include grandparents and extended family members in their bubbles and some parents are doing it all alone, while working or not.
But lockdown experiences go beyond the number of people in your family and the support you do or don’t have. The amount of space you have in your home and outside it has to be a factor as well.
This is why parents can’t be hard on themselves. When schooling starts they can’t compare themselves to other parents or expect the same result, and they can’t approach their “home school” in the same way. Each household will be different and families need to adjust to what suits them best.
And just as students and their parents are facing challenges, it’s important to acknowledge that teachers and staff will be dealing with some of the same issues as the rest of us.
We can’t expect them to give us the same level of engagement in a virtual environment as they would in a normal setting. Everyone’s wellbeing needs to be taken into account.
This school term is an unconventional one. It will be a term of adapting — and that alone provides plenty of learning opportunities for everyone.
Learning at home is not the same as learning at school. If the biggest lesson that children and families take away from this learning from home experience is one of adjusting to a different situation, that can’t be a bad thing.

Markets give ammo for higher taxes	The New Zealand Herald	As stock markets soared back to where they were at the start of the year, opinion writers tried to make sense of the nonsensical.
For equity investors “it’s like the pandemic never happened”, wrote Matt Phillips in the New York Times, noting the S&P 500, a leading stock market index, on Tuesday was up nearly 45 per cent since March 23.
This despite plummeting corporate earnings, tens of millions of people unemployed and industries such as tourism, retail and entertainment shattered and facing an uncertain future.
Clearly, factors other than the usual fundamentals have driven the rally — not least the actions of central banks and their relentless money printing policies to inject trillions of dollars into markets in an attempt to hasten the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis.
Through it all, though, an even bigger question is bubbling to the surface.
How does one reconcile the increasing disconnect between the stock markets and what’s happening in the real world?
Roger Armstrong in the Financial Times put it best when he wrote that Covid-19 “has put working and middle-class people under immense strain, while the asset-owning classes have felt relatively little pain”. And let’s not forget the big equity drops in March came after a decade of historic increases in asset values.
In short, it’s the old ‘the rich get richer’ sort of story and even though everyday workers get to participate to some extent through pension schemes such as KiwiSaver, the imbalance or inequality gap grows ever wider.
Armstrong cites research that shows the richest 11 per cent of the world population holds more than 80 per cent of its wealth and in the US, almost 90 per cent of equities are owned by the wealthiest 10 per cent of households.
Those figures may not be new but the picture has been painted a lot brighter by the fallout from Covid. And, how do governments respond and develop policies to pay back the money borrowed to pay for the recovery?
It’s worth repeating some of what former Prime Minister Sir Bill English said in a presentation in late March as Finance Minister Grant Robertson was preparing the start of what would become a $50 billion-plus rescue package for the economy.
If markets shrug off the major threat to the wider economy, English said, the public will realise something is amiss and wealth or capital gains taxes could follow.
“If the equity market falls 30 per cent, coughs and then recovers, the Government would likely have no hesitation in pushing through a capital gains tax (CGT),” he said.
The problem is the obvious solutions of higher taxes on wealth, capital gains and even redistribution run counter to what economies need right now. But if the current Government ever needed a plank for a tax policy, the stock market is offering an increasingly sturdy one.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Changing to deal with pandemic	The Northern Advocate	As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to sweep across New Zealand and the world, we are all being forced to make changes to the way we do things. The current nationwide lockdown is a prime example of the adaptations we have had to make — often with little notice, or time to prepare.
At the Northern Advocate, we are also being forced to make alterations to the way we do things as we cover the everyday events that have been our bread and butter.
Of course, there is nothing everyday about any of this.
While we will continue to provide all the news and information you need each day, there will be a few changes to the way that information appears in your Advocate.
With sport, both national and international, currently on hold, our sports coverage will inevitably be reduced. Many of our regular features, such as Our Treasures and Good Life and some of our other columnists will make less regular appearances.
You’ll also notice changes in the paper, too, with some sections moved around and other sections, such as puzzles, being expanded.
You will also often see more local, national and international news.
We don’t take our role as news media lightly, and we understand the importance of keeping you informed in these testing times. We are an essential service and we will continue to be your trusted source of news and information.
We value your support, so thank you for sticking with us. We’re in this together and together we can do this.

Marking high-flyers’ centenary	The Australian	As the RAAF marks its centenary, it is increasingly vital to the nation’s security. And it is looking to the future. A new “Space Command”, to be established within the Australian Defence Force next year, is likely to be jointly staffed by air force, army and navy personnel, Ben Packham reports. Amid a growing military space race, its role will be to operate and protect the ADF’s satellite-based capabilities, Chief of Air Force Mel Hupfeld revealed in an interview to mark the RAAF centenary. Unlike China and Russia, he said, Australia would not seek technologies to attack enemy satellites. But the nation needed “space domain awareness capabilities”, to monitor threats so satellites could be moved to protect them from orbiting debris and enemy attack.
The RAAF is also sharpening its focus on “grey zone” threats below the threshold of war. “The division between peace and war is not a binary one and is no longer applicable,’’ Air Marshal Hupfeld says. “We need to operate all day, every day, noting there is this challenge of actions below the threshold of conflict.’’ Reflecting a worsening strategic environment, the Morrison government will spend $1bn to fast-track the creation of an Australian sovereign guided-weapons enterprise, Greg Sheridan writes. This will be a new military manufacturing industry, for missiles and guided weapons.
Current imperatives are far from those of March 31, 1921 when the RAAF was formed and the move was opposed by some generals who did not comprehend that the air was not merely an adjunct to surface forces but a revolutionary means of warfare. The RAAF’s formation, and its contribution to the nation over a century, are set out in Command of the Skies, a 64-page magazine included in Wednesday’s newspaper. More than 350,000 Australians have served in the Air Force since 1921, including 11,191 who gave their lives for our country. They are buried in cemeteries as far afield as the UK, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, North America, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands and across Australia. As editor Steve Waterson writes: “The 27,000 Australian airmen who served in Europe paid a terrible price in young lives; but had they not resisted Hitler’s tide of genocidal tyranny, the world we would be living in today does not bear thinking about.’’ From the Women’s Auxiliary Australian Air Force, to the heroes among heroes who won the Victoria Cross, the magazine captures a vital, living part of our national heritage — one that we need more than ever.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Stepping up to more active role	The Australian	As the US retreats, Canberra must work with other nations
It is no surprise a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade audit ordered by Scott Morrison has called on Australia to pursue a strengthened and more active role in multilateral bodies including the UN. With the US turning inward and China’s ambition to dominate the global agenda, the recommendation makes sense not only for us but also other medium powers. Last month’s World Health Assembly, at which 137 nations unanimously supported our lead advocacy for an independent inquiry into COVID-19 despite China’s fierce initial opposition, was a show of what can be achieved. Beijing was left to throw in the towel.
Similar involvement is needed in other key UN agencies. Some are run by Chinese nationals, such as the International Telecommunication Union, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the UN Industrial Development Organisation. The strategically important ITU, headed by Chinese official Houlin Zhao, is considering a Beijing-Huawei proposal for a radical reinvention of the internet. Critics say it would “bake in authoritarianism”, allowing states to control how and who uses the web. The anger that led Donald Trump to pull the US out of the World Health Organisation last month was understandable. But it may have been better for the US to stay inside and fight with other democracies for reform. The WHO would be diminished if it fell completely under Chinese domination. The Prime Minister was right, in announcing the audit of “global institutions and rule-making processes” during a Lowy Institute address last October, to warn against “negative globalism”. Australia’s interests, he insisted, “are not served by isolationism and protectionism”, adding he was determined to see the country play a more active role than it had in the past in the bodies that set international standards. As the WHA showed, outcomes are likely to be far better when democracies seize the initiative and become involved more actively in contentious global issues.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
EDITORIAL Time to take the pulse of Northland health	The Northern Advocate	As the saying goes, the “greatest wealth is health” and anyone who has been ill or supported others, know this to be true.
Covid-19 has thrust healthcare abruptly into the spotlight in 2020 and in the first months of the pandemic healthcare workers, in particular, were regularly — and rightfully — lauded as heroes.
We all remember “Jenny from New Zealand”, whom British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke of so fondly, and gratefully, after he contracted the virus.
When compared with countries such as the US, where even basic healthcare can be prohibitively expensive, Kiwis are lucky to have access to decent, affordable medical services.
This, of course, is exactly as it should be in any developed country.
But that doesn’t mean our healthcare industry should not have a physical every now and then. Over the next week, the Advocate will take the pulse of Northland.
We have gone from Te Hapua to Dargaville speaking with the people hard at work in the sector, and meeting those who use the system regularly.
Beginning today, we look at the impact of Covid-19. We meet a couple who battled it, and learn a little about their life-changing experiences.
We also take you inside Whangārei Hospital, where the very real threat of Covid meant they had to rethink how they worked, and how they would deal with a worst-case scenario.
The impact of the virus has been widespread and its effects are a thread throughout the series.
Tomorrow, we look at inequities in the health system and what they mean for our communities — especially our most vulnerable.
The rest of the week, we cover the services available, mental health and addiction, community-based healthcare. We round out our series on Saturday with an in-depth discussion with Northland DHB chief executive Nick Chamberlain about the future of the region’s healthcare.
As with any large, complex organisation, there are good and bad aspects. But one thing became clear — those who work in the health sector in Northland are dedicated and passionate about what they do.
As always, we’d love to hear what you think so email us at editor@northernadvocate.co.nz.

Ridiculous mistakes leave public vulnerable to Covid	The Australian	As vaccines reach 750,000 the nation will soon be safer from the virus We have a vaccine, with sufficient supplies to protect doctors and nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. But Queensland Health and the state’s second-largest teaching hospital, the Princess Alexandra, lacked the common sense to put those workers first in the queue. Instead, unvaccinated health workers caught the virus and it has spread.
The situation beggars belief and inspires little confidence. Australians are paying a high price for gross stupidity. Easter plans are in chaos and staff have been stood down, without JobKeeper to fall back on. Small business owners watch in desperation as their stock goes bad. The tourism industry stands to lose $1.7bn as two-thirds of Australians declare they will not travel over Easter. Locking down Brisbane will cost the economy at least $100m a day. And the accommodation sector calculates that booking cancellations over the 10-day Easter period already amount to $40m in Queensland and $9m in Brisbane alone.
Much will depend on Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s announcement on Thursday morning as to whether almost three million people in Greater Brisbane will spend Easter under lockdown. Over the NSW border, businesses and residents in the Byron area are on tenterhooks. Bluesfest 2021 has been cancelled, the day before its scheduled start.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles, eager to shift the blame, says federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud should “give himself an uppercut”. Most of the public shares the sentiment — but they’d choose a different punching bag. Mr Miles complained on Wednesday that Queensland has held back the Pfizer vaccine for second doses because it had no certainty of supply from the commonwealth. That furphy won’t wash. As Health Editor Natasha Robinson wrote: “It is difficult to understand why Queensland should need to hold back any vaccine doses at all. The commonwealth has been clear from the start it was holding back 50 per cent of the vaccine doses it received from Pfizer, AstraZeneca and CSL to account for second doses. There is absolutely no need for states to stockpile.’’ Health Minister Greg Hunt’s office says state and territory governments and health ministers were given 12-week vaccination plans several weeks ago to support planning.
That said, there is a communication gap between Canberra and the states. It must be fixed, by senior bureaucrats or national cabinet. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the problem is that the states barely receive any notice of how much vaccine they are being supplied until a couple of days before delivery, putting extra pressure on state health systems. Her Health Minister, Brad Hazzard, complained: “You get 45,000 items dumped on your front door at night and told ‘Now you should have it out by the next morning’. No one would be able to do that.” Federalism is far from perfect but logistical problems can and must be remedied for the sake of frontline medical staff and the public, whose health and livelihoods depend on it. Excuses, blame games and wars of words undermine management of the pandemic. Mr Hazzard’s demand for an apology from the federal government was puerile. And AMA president Omar Khorshid is right. It is unacceptable there are still unvaccinated doctors and nurses in public hospitals caring for COVID-19 patients or potential patients.
On the positive side, the vaccination program is gathering pace after a slow start. By Friday, 750,000 Australians will be vaccinated, three times as many as at the start of last week. At this rate, the public can only hope the Brisbane lockdown is the last of its kind the nation needs to endure. Only two new locally acquired cases were reported in Queensland, both linked to a nurse infected at the PA hospital. The low number of new cases was “encouraging”, Ms Palaszczuk said. Building on that, we hope the Premier treats the mini-outbreak in the way it deserves, by lifting the lockdown and focusing on testing and contact tracing while the region is allowed to get on with its business and enjoy Easter. A protracted lockdown at the start of school holidays is the last thing the state or nation needs. As soon as the lockdown is lifted, other states should do their part by lifting border restrictions. This week’s harsh misuse of Victoria’s traffic light entry permit system was unacceptable. Planeloads of travellers who arrived in Melbourne from Brisbane on Monday night were detained in hotel quarantine for more than 36 hours. They were told before they boarded flights they could quarantine at home before returning a negative COVID-19 test. Amid 2.8 million deaths from 127 million infections globally, we have much to be proud of in our management of the pandemic. But this week’s setbacks show the margin for error is negligible. With a health system spanning two tiers of government, co-operation and competence, not blame shifting and playing politics, are the way to success.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
EDITORIAL Unenviable role of the Opposition	Wanganui Chronicle	Asocial media post by Opposition leader Simon Bridges this week went (yes, we’ll say it) viral for all the wrong reasons.
In the April 20 comment, Bridges pointed out “the entire country has made huge sacrifices to ensure the four-week lockdown was effective”.
However, his ensuing criticism of the Government drew a swift and damning reaction. Comments on the post piled on. Many of the 29,000-plus, if not most, attacked Bridges for daring to criticise the Government during a crisis. It’s impossible to know how many commenters were genuine; it appears many had not even read his post.
For the record, the 342-word post does not include “the medicine is worse than the cure”. Bridges stated this shortly after his Facebook post, at an April 20 press conference following the Government announcing its plan to move to level 3. He did voice a similar concern in his post, however, noting “the harm of staying in lockdown will be greater than if we were to come out”. “We will no doubt see a rise in mental health problems and stress-related illnesses,” he elaborated. “I also have real concerns about the delay in healthcare ... like cancer treatment, screening, and thousands of operations.”
There may well be some validity in Bridges’ points, which have been raised elsewhere without such backlash. He said New Zealand was being held back because the Government had not used the lockdown period to fine-tune testing and tracing, and the availability of PPE hadn’t been at the standard it should have been.
“The rate of testing for the first half of lockdown was low, work has only just begun on surveillance testing to confirm whether community transmission is occurring. Tracing is the biggest challenge and experts have identified major shortcomings in the methods being used by the Government.”
The Opposition’s main role is to question the government of the day and hold it accountable, no matter the circumstances.
Bridges has been criticised for choosing to commute between his home in Tauranga and Wellington to chair the Epidemic Response Committee. Whether one agrees with his transit or not, few would disagree the committee has raised highly pertinent issues.
Walter Lippman is credited with saying: “In a democracy, the Opposition is not only tolerated as constitutional, but must be maintained because it is indispensable.” We now reprise Evelyn Beatrice Hall, who first wrote: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”
Bridges is right to question the Government on its preparedness and response to this pandemic. To criticise him for speaking out is amiss. More to the point is whether any of his criticisms are valid.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Magnificent men and their flying machines	The New Zealand Herald	At the risk of showing my not-quite-a-boomer age, a couple of my favourite sporting memories came almost back-to-back in 1983 and had the same “impossible dream” feel to them.
Many will remember Kiwi winning the 1983 Melbourne Cup “from nowhere” as jockey Jim Cassidy rode the most patiently daring and well-timed race and Kiwi came home with a wet sail.
It was a similar situation two months earlier when Australia II, with its daring winged keel, took Dennis Conner’s Liberty to a seventh and deciding race off the coast of Newport, Rhode Island.
Australian skipper John Bertrand was trailing by a significant margin but took a gamble on looking for the extra pressure and Conner failed to cover him and coughed up the lead in a race that seemed unwinnable for the Aussies.
It’s odd now looking back on YouTube and watching those old 12-metre boats — with their huge spinnakers — slug it out like a couple of tired turtles swimming through honey on a course that measured more than 40km from start to finish.
It’s easy to see why people would complain about preferring to watch paint dry — not something you can say about these modern foiling monohulls.
The difference between today’s AC75 “flying boats” and those old 12-metres is like the difference between an e-bike and a penny farthing.
But the irony is that the technological evolution of the America’s Cup owes so much to that event in 1983.
Ben Lexcen’s radical keel design was arguably the difference between the two teams and the secrecy that surrounded it helped generate public interest.
In 1987, we had the “Plastic Fantastic” fibreglass design of KZ7 — another creative technological leap that got people talking. Through various tweaks and quantum leaps — including rogue catamarans (1988) and trimarans (2010) — we ended up with the spectacular foiling catamarans used in 2013 in San Francisco and the smaller, faster versions used in Bermuda in 2017.
Back in 1983, you could literally have watched paint dry before the races finished — they took that long — but there’s no chance that would happen now, these races are over before you could get the lid off the can.
So, as we settle in for what we hope will be a spectacular show over the next couple of weeks, we hope you enjoy this special preview magazine that sets the scene for what’s ahead, pays homage to where we’ve been and explains how these modern boats fly.
We have columns from qualified insiders such as Dean Barker and Mark Orams, as well as our own Secret Sailor. Dylan Cleaver looks back at all the controversy, drama and scandal that seem to go hand-in-hand with this contest, while Michael Burgess celebrates the six most memorable moments in the history of the Cup — with a little Kiwi bias thrown in.

Aucklanders are not the only ones fond of reviving history, [... ] [Derived headline ]	The New Zealand Herald	Aucklanders are not the only ones fond of reviving history, as is shown in our cover house. The sharp renovation was a joint effort between a local architect, an American-based interior designer and the owners who work globally, all of whom appreciated bringing 1910s design sensitively into the 21st century. The result is heritage meets cool Scandi that will last another century at least.
The same could be said of the art-filled city fringe apartment, a 1930s gem that is only one of a handful of heritage city fringe apartments. It does demonstrate the longevity of density when it is well-designed, as does the 1905 Epsom villa where traditional front switches to mdern pool out the back.
Good new density is appearing, as we show in The Hadlow, a new neighbourhood in Grey Lynn of stylish town houses with gardens that are close to the action, yet still affordable - as indeed Grey Lynn was, back before it gentrified.
Lifestyle properties really come into their own in the summer, so the stylish modern take on a rural barn might tempt you to escape to the country and feel like you’re on holiday all year around.

Auckland’s houses are all about 21st century living, but we’ [... ] [Derived headline ]	The New Zealand Herald	Auckland’s houses are all about 21st century living, but we’re still fond of our heritage buildings that date from when the city was a smaller, gentler place and its population was in the hundreds of thousands, not a million and a half-plus.
Clever home builders are creating modern homes that challenge what’s old and what’s new: look at the photos of the Coxs Bay house on page 5 and you’d think “1880s charmer”. Think again: it was built only a few years ago.
The grandparents of our OneRoof interview this week, Kiri Barfoot, would recognise some of our other properties — bungalows and arts and crafts villas with modern interiors, Italian-style villas with all the mod-cons, and an apartment in one of the city’s earliest blocks, Westminster Court. Kiri, whose name is above the door of the family business that now numbers 2400 people, still had to apply for management jobs and would like to see more women reach the top of the business. Read our interview with her on page 86.

Travel to boost economy, jobs	The Australian	Aussies and Kiwis are well placed to help each other
It’s a tempting thought. After weeks of isolation at home, juggling work and homeschooling, the prospect of a holiday break to the winter sun of Port Douglas or the New Zealand snowfields would lift the spirits of many people on both sides of the ditch. Don’t book yet. Scott Morrison and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern made clear, after the latter joined the national cabinet on Tuesday, that a “trans-Tasman bubble” permitting two-way travel between Australia and New Zealand would not be happening in the next week or two. It is likely to happen in coming months, however, long before Australians and New Zealanders have the opportunity to spread their wings to Europe, North America or Asia. As Mr Morrison said, trans-Tasman travel should be possible by the time Melburnians were free to fly to Cairns. And he floated the possibility of families being free to holiday interstate by the end of the school term. The winter vacation in most states is in early July. It was important to flag trans-Tasman travel, the Prime Minister said, as “part of the road back’’.
That road will involve supporting the return of a million Australians to jobs lost in March and last month. It is time to arrest the impact of the pandemic on jobs and productivity. About 440,000 of the jobs lost have been in the accommodation and food services sectors. And as Robin Ironside reports, employees stood down at Qantas and Jetstar will remain without work through to the end of next month, with flight cancellations extended until then. International flights are not expected to resume before August, possibly much later. In the absence of visitors from around the globe, a flurry of holidaying within states, between states and across the Tasman would be a shot in the arm to employment, profits and government revenue. Workers in the airline, hospitality, accommodation, car hire, cafe and restaurant and theme park industries in both countries, who have been among those hardest hit by the economic effects of coronavirus, would benefit.
New Zealand, which faces an election in September, has imposed an even stricter lockdown than Australia, which is why its economic effects are likely to be even more severe. Calls are growing across the Tasman to fire up economic activity as soon as possible. Both countries have excelled at containing the coronavirus. Much will depend on that success continuing. On Tuesday, New Zealand recorded its second day in a row of no new COVID-19 cases. The time to move, as Ms Ardern said after the national cabinet meeting, will be when New Zealand is comfortable and confident that it would not receive new cases of COVID-19 from Australia and that it would not export new cases. Australians feel the same way. The scheme would work only when the states were ready to lift border restrictions. One attraction of the safe “bubble”, as Ms Ardern said, would be no need for quarantining at either end.In a normal year, about 1.2 million Australians holiday across the Tasman, with 1.6 million Kiwis holidaying here. Ms Ardern’s attendance at Tuesday’s meeting was the first time a New Zealand prime minister has joined a meeting of Australia’s federal, state and territory leaders since John Curtin was prime minister. The “safe bubble” would be a sensible extension of the close, strong ties between Australia and New Zealand.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
A relationship full of promise	The Australian	Australia and India are natural partners in the Indo-Pacific
From Vegemite, Weet-Bix and minerals to university degrees and idyllic holidays, Australia has much to offer India’s rapidly growing middle class. And India has much to offer Australia by way of investment, skilled immigration and entrepreneurial flair, exemplified by Indian contractors building homes and new infrastructure in western Sydney and farther afield.
Scott Morrison, understandably, postponed his January visit to India due to the bushfire emergency and will travel to the subcontinent later this year. In the interim, Trade Minister Simon Birmingham and more than 100 Australian businesses and organisations have used their trade mission well. The mission has forged closer economic ties with India, the world’s sixth largest economy, which is set to grow into the third largest by 2035. Beyond trade and investment, as this newspaper has pointed out for years, Australia and India are natural allies, sharing strategic interests, a democratic Westminster heritage and the English language. Strong as the existing ties are, it is in the interests of both nations to develop them further.
The economic impact of COVID-19 on Australia, especially the tourism and education sectors, has highlighted the need for more diversification in our trade relations. The coronavirus is set to subtract $6bn from national output this year, modelling by Deloitte Access Economics suggests. While the crisis will pass, Australia should use it as a wake-up call to reduce our heavy economic dependence on China. Trade is not a zero-sum game, however. And when China’s economy and Chinese demand for Australian goods and services roar back, we should continue strengthening our broader economic relationships. Australia’s two-way trade with India was worth $30bn last year, while two-way trade with China, by comparison, totalled more than $200bn. India is Australia’s eighth largest trading partner and fifth largest export destination. But the rise of a prosperous Indian middle class affords new opportunities for Indians to travel, to educate their children in overseas universities and to enjoy the best of Australian produce. Tourism Australia’s drive, backed by the Morrison government, to attract Indian tourists to the T20 cricket World Cup in October, is well targeted. And in a market of 1.3 billion, online sales of Australian goods in India promises to be a game changer for exporters.
The downside of pursuing trade ties with India is its unfortunate inclination towards protectionism. In Mumbai on Wednesday, Senator Birmingham urged India to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, egged on by Indian manufacturers, opted last year to remain outside the 15-nation RCEP pact, which includes the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations members, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.
Frustration with Indian protectionism prompted Donald Trump to brand India a “tariff king” last year. But this week, conscious of the three-million-strong Indian diaspora in the US who will vote in November, the President has been in India in pursuit of a trade deal. More important, Mr Trump has forged agreements with Mr Modi on military co-operation and intelligence sharing, with India firmly committed to freedom of navigation through the South China Sea. India’s purchase of $3bn of advanced military equipment from the US showed the importance Mr Modi places on the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between the Indo-­Pacific’s four most strategically significant democracies: the US, India, Japan and ­Australia. After decades in which New Delhi’s main military alliance was with the old Soviet Union, it is firmly focused on a strong alliance with the US and other Western nations, including Australia.That is one reason Australia and India are “more complementary than competitive” as Senator Birmingham said in Mumbai. Australia’s aim was to encourage India to look outwards, not inward, because it is “through global markets and inter­national trade that the world has lifted hundreds of millions of ­people out of poverty”.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Striking right balance on vital foreign investment	The Australian	Australia can be open for business and enhance its security Ten weeks ago, a day before launching the JobKeeper rescue, Josh Frydenberg set out temporary and precautionary changes to foreign investment laws. The Treasurer declared all proposed foreign investments subject to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act would require approval, regardless of value or nature of the investor. He argued these were extraordinary times, with the value of companies and assets severely diminished here and around the world because of the coronavirus pandemic. “This is not an investment freeze,” Mr Frydenberg insisted. “Australia is open for business.” At the time the Treasurer stressed this was not aimed at any country, but the public sighed in relief because an expansionist, cashed-up China is on the prowl. As we report, Mr Frydenberg is beefing up resources and compliance to give the Foreign Investment Review Board better “eyes and ears”, as well as introducing a robust national security test. The aim is to keep our pro-foreign investment stance, via streamlining measures, but improve capacity to identify proposals that contain security risks. It’s a difficult balance to get right, especially in a turbulent geopolitical setting and when capital spending is in a hole, even before COVID-19. If we raise the bar too high, we limit options for expansion and jobs in a shrinking economy. If the barrier is set too low, we expose the nation to danger.
Mr Frydenberg claims the reforms are the most significant since the act was introduced in 1975. All foreign investments in sensitive national security businesses will be subject to a zero “monetary screening threshold”; before the emergency, only foreign governments were subject to that level. There will be a new “last resort” power, allowing the Treasurer to apply or vary conditions or order disposal where security risks emerge post-approval. The FIRB and Australian Taxation Office will get a funding boost for the added scrutiny; there will be higher penalties for breaches. The government aims to introduce legislation in October so the measures can take effect at the start of next year. The crisis screening measures will stay in place until then.
There has been a push from so-called hawks within the foreign policy and security establishment, including key Coalition MPs, to give more weight to security risks due to the predatory nature of state-owned enterprises. In our pages, Australian Strategic Policy Institute executive director Peter Jennings has led calls for a new national security strategy that “includes health and biosecurity, climate, human security, critical infrastructure, security of supply of petrol, oils and lubricants, the ever-expanding range of cyber-security challenges, university and industry R&D, and more traditional defence, intelligence and foreign policy concerns”. He argues the FIRB be moved from Treasury, reporting to the Prime Minister via an all-powerful national security adviser.
For hawks, ultra-wary of China’s moves and motives, the logical step is to reverse past FIRB decisions, including the ill-considered leasing of the Port of Darwin and deals on electricity, gas, medical facilities and farmland. Such steps would raise red flags, so to speak, about the nation as an investment risk. The proposed “last resort” powers will not be retrospective. Australia was built by foreign capital, from Britain’s Vestey empire in the rural sector through to the US, Japanese and Dutch money behind our minerals and resources industries. The US is still the largest foreign investor here, with holdings four times the value of China’s stake, which is fifth. One in 10 businesses has benefited from foreign capital. Yet only 1 per cent of FIRB approvals have a national security implication.
But China’s rise, and its aggressive, debt-trap push with the Belt and Road Initiative, demands a better-equipped screening apparatus. The Morrison government is wisely seeking a middle path that promotes an open foreign investment regime while drawing on the economic expertise of Treasury. FIRB chairman David Irvine is a former ASIO chief and diplomat. After 2015 changes, the agency has been enhanced to identify and deal with security issues. It has often meant conditions have been placed on FIRB approvals; half of all approvals, or 80 per cent by value, now have provisos attached. As the Treasurer argues, there are several lenses through which proposals need to be assessed, such as tax, competition and the character of the investor. The narrow prescription of the hawks would be counter-productive and place severe limits on growth, industrial development and living standards. In any case, Mr Frydenberg says the proposed reforms mean the government will be able to “call in” an investment before, during or after acquisition for review if it raises security concerns. That’s a big step. He points out the US, Britain, New Zealand, Canada, Japan and EU have updated foreign investment rules in response to new security challenges. That reflects a changing global order, in a financial, trade and military sense. Right now, in the midst of an economic calamity and tensions with China rising, the last thing we need is a predator scooping up companies in distress or assets vital for our national security and prosperity.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Investment, technology to drive cleaner energy	The Australian	Australia has comparative advantages in renewable power
In late 2017, Australia’s competition regulator, Rod Sims, described energy affordability as “Australia’s largest economic challenge”. It remains a major issue, despite progress on gas exploration and development and in renewable energy generation. Australian National University research shows the nation is on track, between 2018 and this year, to invest in wind and solar power three times faster per capita than Germany, four to five times faster than China, the EU, Japan and the US, and 10 times faster than the global average. That trend, however, is stuttering. On Wednesday, Perry Williams reported that congestion woes in the power grid threaten to hike electricity bills, according to numbers crunched by the Queensland government’s investment giant, QIC.
The fund, with clients including Australia’s largest superannuation funds controlling $730bn of retirement savings, noted the number of committed new energy projects has plummeted this financial year. The problem has arisen because of lack of transmission capacity to transfer renewable energy to the grid, especially from remote locations. The fall-off in renewables investment also threatens to derail Australia’s efforts to achieve deeper cuts to carbon emissions. According to the Clean Energy Regulator, 600MW of new generation from renewables has been committed in the current financial year so far and another 1500MW is forecast before July. Last financial year more than 3300MW was committed. To put the numbers in perspective, however, Australia requires at least 30,000MW of solar and wind power if it is to replace coal generation by 2040, and 47,000MW if more aggressive pollution cuts are required. The knock-on effect of the fall-off in new projects is likely to be higher power bills, creating further uncertainty among domestic and commercial users. For entrepreneurs the basic lesson, given current technology, is to situate viable projects within easier reach of the grid.
The problems will exacerbate the concerns of business leaders, which were revealed last month in The Weekend Australian’s annual survey of CEOs. John Durie, who surveyed 73 business leaders, found they were almost unanimous in demanding a clear energy policy as the priority for the country. “In more than two decades polling big business leaders, there has not been a single issue so clearly enunciated,” Durie wrote. The survey reflected the experiences many businesses have faced in getting an ­affordable energy supply. High energy costs — as Mr Sims, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission’s chief executive, said two years ago — can result in plant ­closures, reduced investment and job losses, The Morrison government’s plan to consider more than 100 new technologies with a view to doubling renewable energy in the grid within a decade and modernising high-­polluting industries will be vital. As reported this month, the plan will involve input from industry, the finance sector and researchers. Opportunities for short, medium and long-term investment will be identified in a range of technologies. These will cover carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lithium production, biofuels, waste-to-energy technology and feed supplements to reduce methane emissions in farming.
In the wake of scathing criticism during the bushfire emergency, the Morrison government is challenging perceptions that it is falling short on energy policy and climate change. On Wednesday Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the key to ensuring power prices continued to fall and that renewable capacity increased was to cut the cost of storage, backup and grid upgrades. The government’s $1bn Grid Reliability Fund, he said, had joined with NSW to underwrite the Queensland-NSW Interconnector to unlock energy generated in Queensland.
In Davos at the World Economic Forum, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann argued perceptions that Australia was not taking climate change seriously were false: “There is a global demand for coal and if it’s not met by cleaner Australian coal it will be met by comparatively dirtier coal from other sources and the world environment will be worse off.”Josh Frydenberg has dismissed an alarmist warning from the Bank of International Settlements that the Reserve Bank of Australia may have to purchase coalmines and fossil-fuel power stations to save the economy from the financial impact of climate change. As the Treasurer said, the BIS also advocated a balanced approach involving “not only emissions reduction but adaptation, mitigation and resilience measures put in place without compromising the strength of the economy”. Australia’s comparative advantages in fossil fuels such as coal and gas and in solar generation make the economy well positioned to transition to cleaner energy. But steady, incremental action, based on science, has more to offer than hot air.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
A rebuke for Myanmar’s military	The Australian	Australia may have to sharpen sanctions against the rogue regime Myanmar’s generals would be foolish to ignore the significance of Foreign Minister Marise Payne’s announcement that Australian military aid to the country is being suspended. It may be, as Senator Payne said, that our bilateral Defence Cooperation Program has been “limited”. With a longstanding embargo on the supply of Australian weapons firmly in place, the program has been restricted to non-combat areas such as English-language training. It was worth $360,000 in 2020-21 and $330,000 the previous year.
But even that has been deemed to be beyond the pale because of the unacceptable conduct of Myanmar’s ruthless military towards the democratic potential of the country and its long-suffering citizenry.
Australia has had diplomatic relations with what was previously known as Burma since 1952, 10 years before the original coup by General Ne Win that first brought the military to power. Since then, few countries in the region have done more to help Myanmar, especially in assisting it along the tortuous path towards its temporary return to democracy in 2011.
The jackbooted oppression the generals have unleashed since their February 1 putsch has, however, left democracies like Australia with no alternative but to sever ties with the Tatmadaw, as the military is known.
When, amid Myanmar’s democratic political and economic reforms of 2013, the Gillard government lifted some Australian restrictions on defence ties, the stated objective was “to encourage the development of a modern, professional defence force that continues to support democratisation”. The military’s appalling conduct has left no doubt about its failure to fulfil that optimism.
More than 50 pro-democracy protesters have died, some shot in the head by military snipers; some children in their teens, and some women. A leader of Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy died while being brutally tortured by the army.
More than 1500 people, including Suu Kyi, the country’s leader elected in a landslide last November, and her Australian economic adviser, Professor Sean Turnell, remain incarcerated, with their fate uncertain. Despite the rampant oppression, however, there is no sign of the popular resistance to the military flagging. That, too, should be a reality check for the generals.
Close military ties with China, which the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute says is providing the generals with 50 per cent of their arms and military equipment, have raised speculation about growing Beijing influence in one of Southeast Asia’s most strategic nations.
So have rapidly intensifying military ties with Moscow, with reports that Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was in Naypyitaw days before the February coup to finalise a deal for weapons supplies. In a move that could have far-reaching strategic implications, China and Russia joined together at the UN to insulate the Myanmar junta from an international rebuke by blocking UN Security Council condemnation of the coup.
Australia’s non-military aid budget for Myanmar in 2020-21 totals $42.1m. It is focused strongly on helping the country battle the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Payne announced that it will also be directed largely towards helping the oppressed Rohingyas and other ethnic minorities.
The government is right to keep the humanitarian program in place. Senator Payne was correct, however, to serve notice that Australia is continuing to review its sanctions against Myanmar. These currently include the arms embargo as well as targeted sanctions against individual junta figures and their corrupt business cronies. With other Western democracies including the US, UK, EU, Canada and New Zealand taking a similar stand, the generals should be in no doubt about the potential consequences if they continue with their brutal destruction of Myanmar’s democratic hopes.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Course correction for Andrews	The Australian	Australia needs Victoria’s Premier to prevail over the virus
Our special Newspoll on Tuesday showed a dive in popularity for Victorian Premier Dan Andrews. His net satisfaction rating has fallen from 58 per cent in April to 20 per cent last week. And the share of those who believe he has handled the coronavirus badly has jumped from 11 per cent to 36 per cent. This is not surprising. His administration has made serious errors; on Tuesday there were 374 new cases of COVID-19. The Newspoll result is worrying, not so much in a traditional political sense for Mr Andrews but as a mark of the fragility of the confidence in effective leadership necessary during a crisis that imperils lives and livelihoods. The pandemic is a severe test of a government’s basic duty to protect citizens, and not just in Victoria. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has acknowledged the risks facing NSW with its own infection clusters and said, understandably, that she felt “stressed and worried” about the outlook.
In April, Mr Andrews was among premiers recording remarkably high levels of bipartisan political support in Newspoll. At its best, the national cabinet symbolises this cross-party spirit of practical co-operation to tackle an emergency. People seem to be thinking more as citizens than voters; many Victorians not fond of Labor have wished their Premier success in grappling with a rapidly unfolding and uncertain crisis. Australians realise their leaders are having to make difficult decisions under great pressure. But this attenuation of tribal hostilities comes with a caveat: governments are expected to be competent, clear and candid, and to not play politics. High levels of trust entail high expectations. It is also true that policymakers can do only so much if citizens lack common sense, goodwill and responsibility.
Tuesday’s Newspoll is a danger sign for Mr Andrews. It represents understandable popular dismay with a series of missteps. These have a common theme: big-stick talk from the Premier with erratic enforcement and, to some eyes, signs of political motives distorting what should be pragmatic decisions. There was lax contact tracing with the Cedar Meats infection outbreak. The excuse of privacy was odd coming from a government that had tried to shame separated lovers into staying home alone. In the same way, the government’s golf ban was hard to reconcile with Mr Andrews’s tepid attempt to prevent last month’s Black Lives Matter rally from making a mockery of months of public compliance with social distancing. Then there was the backflip on help from the Australian Defence Force, an issue allied with a wider failing in thorough and timely contact tracing. And potentially the most serious blunder was entrusting hotel quarantine to private security firms without proper oversight by police or military personnel. That’s quite a catalogue of shortcomings, even allowing for the difficulty of the collective effort to be orchestrated by government, plus some sheer bad luck.
So, it’s fair enough that Mr Andrews pays a political price, but it is far more important to get Victoria’s virus outbreak under control. The risk is that the understandably angry reaction to his stumbles morphs into hyperpartisan politics that distracts from more effective coronavirus policy.
Of course, the opposition and media must continue to hold government accountable through tough yet fair scrutiny. But it is in everybody’s interests that Mr Andrews rises to the challenge that he faces as the elected leader. This is not the time for opportunistic score-settling by his enemies, and the attempt by his more ardent supporters to portray any criticism of the Premier as fake news is equally misplaced. We need to concentrate efforts on fending off the pandemic, especially now when people are weary of the social strain. Scott Morrison has tried to avoid taking potshots at Mr Andrews, and this is because Victorians need our help right now, and Australia needs Victoria to prevail against the coronavirus. An explosion of cases in any state, especially in the populous southeast, is a potential threat beyond its borders. And deeper economic damage from lockdown in Victoria would add only more misery to the national accounts. It’s not an empty slogan to say we’re all in this together.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Vaccine diplomacy a challenge in the Pacific	The Australian	Australia needs to step up efforts or risk losing influence to China Standing up to brazen Chinese attempts to bribe him could not have been easy for Daniel Suidani, the premier of remote and impoverished Malaita, Solomon Islands’ most populous province with 160,000 people. But in displaying the courage and foresight needed to do so, he has delivered a lesson on dealing with Beijing’s notorious debt-trap diplomacy that should resonate among leaders across the Pacific and beyond. It is a lesson as relevant to China’s use of its Belt and Road Initiative to suborn leaders as it is to the way it is employing COVID-19 “vaccine diplomacy” and the supply of millions of doses of its Sinovac, Sinopharm and CanSino to further its strategic interests in countries desperate for help. Doing so is a perverse contradiction of the responsibility China bears for the pandemic. But that has not stopped it cynically seeking to exploit the crisis for its strategic advantage by pledging vaccine supplies to at least 53 countries.
With Australia urgently trying to get 200,000 vaccine doses to help in the deepening COVID-19 crisis in Papua New Guinea, where estimates are there could already be a million infections, Ben Packham reported on Monday that “Australia is in a race against time to secure millions of jabs for the Pacific in the next four weeks or risk a Chinese vaccine diplomacy victory that would push regional partners closer to Beijing”. Much is at stake in Australia succeeding. As Labor’s Pacific spokesman, Pat Conroy, said, Australia needs to deliver on its commitment or risk ceding influence to China: “It is vital Australia remains the partner of choice for Pacific Island nations. If Australia does not step up and provide adequate and timely assistance, this will create a vacuum that will be filled by other nations such as China.” Mr Suidani’s experience on far-flung Malaita shows that even leaders in the most remote parts of the South Pacific are targets when Beijing sees an opportunity to gain a strategic advantage. For 36 years the Solomons maintained diplomatic ties with Taiwan, not Beijing. In 2019 the central government in Honiara succumbed to Chinese pressure and terminated relations with Taiwan. But Mr Suidani decided Malaita would stick with democratic Taiwan and reject any Chinese attempts to gain a toehold on the island. He says he was then approached by agents acting on behalf of Beijing and scandalously offered a bribe of $SI1m ($165,000) to change sides and opt for China. But, as he told Steve Jackson: “What we have seen with the PRC’s involvement in other countries in the region is that everything looks quite good at the start but, at the end of the day, the countries eventually find it difficult to handle the problems that come with dealing with China.” Mr Suidani deserves support for his refusal to submit to China’s blatant attempts at coercion aimed at ensnaring the leading elected official on one of the region’s most strategic islands. Small nations across the world have suffered immeasurable damage from Beijing’s oppressive “creditor imperialism” and the shameless debt-trap diplomacy that gives effect to it. The race to supply vaccines has opened up new opportunities for Beijing to double down on its strategy aimed at establishing influence over nations desperate for help with COVID-19. Mr Suidani’s experience underlines the need for extreme caution about what invariably purports to be Beijing’s no-strings-attached largesse but turns out very differently. After Beijing’s disgraceful conduct over the pandemic, the last thing the world needs is for China to gain a strategic victory by emerging as the white knight when it comes to the supply of vaccines.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Beijing’s virus deceit and bullying must be resisted	The Australian	Australia wants to shape a safer world and feel safe at home
Foreign Minister Marise Payne’s bold and thoughtful speech on Tuesday could hardly have been more important for our troubled relationship with China. Yet Beijing’s trumpeting “wolf warrior” official spokesmen have dismissed it as “rubbish”. Nothing more clearly shows up China’s overwhelming culpability for the problems that have arisen and its failure to learn from the heavy defeat inflicted on it by countries from across the world — not Australia alone — in last month’s vote on a coronavirus inquiry at the World Health Assembly. Ms Payne made it abundantly clear Australia is not going to submit to Chinese bullying or back down over the differences sparked by the inquiry. Beijing would be wise not to underestimate the level of global support Australia has in the standoff.
It would do well, too, not to overlook the strategic significance of Australia’s participation during the next few months in military exercises and maritime surveillance operations by Western allies in the Indo-Pacific, led by the US. With no fewer than three US aircraft carriers already deployed in the Pacific region, Rim of the Pacific exercises, or RIMPAC, off Hawaii in August will see scores of allied warships from dozens of nations, hundreds of combat aircraft and tens of thousands of military personnel join together in a major show of strategic force. Similarly, as we reported on Thursday, Australia is likely to take part in the big Malabar naval exercises in the Bay of Bengal later this year, joining India, the US and Japan in another display of military strength in the Indo-Pacific. Australia also is set to take part in other naval and aircraft exercises off the US Pacific island territory of Guam.
The importance of these exercises and Australia’s participation in them cannot be overstated. They underline the strength of Australia’s alliances at a time of deepening tensions with China and show the depth of concern that exists in the region and beyond over China’s gratuitous bullying tactics against not only Australia but also other countries. The extent of that global concern was seen clearly at the WHA. Despite China’s fierce initial opposition to any investigation, Australia’s demand for the inquiry into the COVID-19 pandemic was backed unanimously by 145 countries. Even China was left with no alternative but to support the motion. In that defeat lies a stark lesson for China as it seeks to bully Australia by harming our barley and beef exports and issuing concocted and manifestly crazy claims about the potential for violence against Chinese students and tourists in Australia.
Ms Payne warned of a systematic campaign of disinformation by China and Russia in using the pandemic to “undermine democracy and create a climate of fear”. As with the vote at the WHA, Ms Payne was able to cite strong backing for Australia’s position, with a report last week by all 27 nations of the EU having reached a similar conclusion about a vast Chinese and Russian campaign of disinformation in Europe. This, the EU said, was targeted at using the pandemic to “exacerbate social polarisation”. Yet a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman wrongly claims “disinformation is Australia’s expertise, not China’s” and is all about Australia. It’s not: no country in the Indo-Pacific region, in particular, is immune to China’s aggression. In recent weeks, China has confronted Malaysian and Vietnamese vessels in the South China Sea and twice sailed an aircraft carrier close to Taiwan. It has seized draconian new powers in Hong Kong. Violence across its border with India in the Himalayas, with thousands of People’s Liberation Army soldiers reportedly deployed to the area, lends weight to the view of analysts who believe India is seen by Beijing as a future battlefront. At a particularly vulnerable time for India over the pandemic, China is embarked on a belligerent drive to warn India off cosying up to the US and Australia. It doesn’t want to see New Delhi become part of an anti-China regional containment policy. Given the context of China’s aggressive and growing militarism across the region, Ms Payne was right to commit Australia to a global push to strengthen our engagement with multilateral institutions “to help shape a safer world and make us safer at home”. Amid deepening global concern about Beijing’s arrogant diplomatic delinquency and bellicosity, it is clearly in Australia’s interest to do so.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
US-Sino cold war could heat up	The Australian	Australia would be party to a military conflict over Taiwan Tuesday marked the anniversary of the outbreak of the Great War, in which Australia paid a heavy price. Far from being the war to “end all wars”, that gruesome conflict sowed the seeds of World War II. And the consequences of both continue to echo. In 1914, few considered the Great War inevitable. One of the most influential tracts among politicians, economists and military strategists was Norman Angell’s The Great Illusion. The mercantile links between Britain and Germany made war obsolete and unthinkable, he argued. Yet war came.
Today, many cling to the comforting illusion that the globalised economy eliminates the risks of war between major powers. John Howard’s pithy observation that Australia need not choose between its history and its geography contained a grain of truth when he espoused it. Since Mr Howard left office in 2007, however, rivalry for regional hegemony in the Indo-Pacific has intensified. Since the ascension of Xi Jinping to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese assertiveness has given way to strident bellicosity. China’s ambition to displace our US ally as the regional hegemon has become undeniable, as shown by its rhetoric and ruthless conduct towards numerous nations in our region. While the West has been preoccupied with the COVID-19 pandemic, China has escalated provocations. From probing the Taiwanese air defence system to sinking a Vietnamese fishing vessel, harassing a Malaysian oil rig and border clashes with India, China has displayed alarming contempt for global opinion. Its militarisation of artificial features and disputed reefs in the South China Sea has continued, flouting the 2016 repudiation of its claims by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.
Those familiar with the communist regime have always recognised that China’s primary strategic ambition is reclamation of the so-called “wayward province” of Taiwan. Since the last Taiwan Strait confrontation in 1996, China’s military modernisation has been directed towards increasing the hazard for US maritime forces deployed to support Taiwan. Mr Xi’s message has been ominous and clear: Taiwan must be brought to heel sooner rather than later. On Tuesday, Paul Dibb, one of the most influential architects of Australia’s post-war security policy, warned in our newspaper of the mounting danger of war between the US and China over Taiwan. Professor Dibb implied that Australian neutrality in such a conflict might remain an option. Such a choice is an illusion. In addition to the joint facility at Pine Gap, our vast continent hosts crucial ground stations including Honeysuckle Creek outside Canberra and Cooby Creek north of Toowoomba. These constitute an indispensable component of US space operations, which enable its multi-domain operations including its nuclear submarines and bombers. In the event of a war between China and the US over Taiwan we are already on the frontline. Although not committing to freedom of navigation operations in the disputed zones of the South China Sea, Australia agreed at AUSMIN talks last week to host more US logistics and fuel stocks in Darwin, outside the current range of Chinese ballistic missiles. Last month the US cast aside its vigilant neutrality in relation to China’s disputes with six littoral states in the disputed zone. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo branded China’s expansionist claims in the area “completely unlawful”. Belatedly, the US is also matching its sharpened rhetoric with actions. It has deployed two aircraft carriers to the South China Sea. And amid the deepening crisis the Trump administration has almost doubled aerial surveillance operations in the South China Sea. Democrat challenger Joe Biden has been critical of Donald Trump’s handling of the US-China relationship. But voters need to hear how Mr Biden would address the most important strategic issue he would face as US president and leader of the free world. He has spoken about China only in general terms and has big questions to answer, as Gerald F. Seib writes in World. Amid rising tensions on both sides of the Pacific, the three months lead-up to the US election on November 3 could make the difference between peace and conflict in our region.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
China’s Uighur spin is as authentic as a purple panda	The Australian	Australian producers are working to recover from export bans The video shown to journalists at the Chinese embassy in Canberra on Wednesday was as schmaltzy and picturesque as the opening of The Sound of Music. Forget distorted coverage in Western media based on “disinformation”, Chinese ambassador Cheng Jingye insisted. According to the six-minute film, entitled Xinjiang is a Wonderful Land, the Chinese Communist Party has transformed the region, in China’s northwest, in a way that has resulted in “economic development, social stability, livelihood improvement and religious harmony”. Xinjiang is now “a land of life, a land of thriving vitality”. Across four years, through education and training — no mention of forced imprisonment in re-education camps — the threat of terrorism has been averted. Ethnic groups, living in religious harmony, work “together to develop a vast magnificent part of the motherland”. The Chinese government has put the inheritance, protection and development of the “excellent traditional ethnic cultures of Xinjiang” high on its agenda, journalists were told. The people shown on camera on Wednesday looked healthy and content in a “promised land of paradise for Muslim Uighurs”, Greg Sheridan writes. Fruit is growing. Chemical production and other industries are flourishing. Transport and infrastructure are being developed. Women shown in the film were dancing happily — no mention of the rapes, forced abortions and sterilisations inflicted on Uighur women reported by the Associated Press in June last year.
Instead of wasting time on amateurish propaganda with the authenticity of a purple panda, China would better serve its interests by working to repair its economic relationship with Australia. It could start by reopening the lines of communication between Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and Trade Minister Dan Tehan, who remains shut out by his counterpart. To their credit, Australian producers are defying Chinese trade bans and finding new markets for almost all affected exports, limiting the damage of Beijing’s punitive economic campaign, Ben Packham reports on Thursday. Exports to China are $20bn a year lower after the sanctions. But barley, coal, copper, cotton, sugar and timber producers have partially or completely diverted shipments to new buyers. Wine traders are struggling to make up their loss. But the overall findings will infuriate Beijing.
After watching China’s presentation, Australian Uighur Tangritagh Women’s Association president Ramila Chanisheff said the number of people who had passed through the detention camps could range from five million to eight million, at more than 380 sites across Xinjiang. The press conference, she believes, is a sign of desperation on the part of Beijing, which is “very much afraid” of growing international scrutiny about the province. The film was staged less than three weeks after the US, Britain, Canada and the EU launched co-ordinated sanctions against Chinese officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In February, Canada’s parliament declared a genocide was under way in the region. Last month, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab accused China of a “highly disturbing program of oppression”. Australia’s approach, at a low point in our bilateral relationship with China, has been more restrained. Foreign Minister Marise Payne has called on China to allow the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to have access to Xinjiang. Such concerns about the Uighurs, however, are notably absent among Muslim nations, including Iran, which recently signed a 25-year economic and security agreement with China.
Wednesday’s spectacle needs to be understood in the context of Chinese efforts to smother discussion about its serious human rights abuses by playing up the records of other nations, including Australia — sometimes with faux human rights concerns, sometimes by manipulating UN agencies. “What’s genocide? Massacring native Americans and Aboriginal Australians, forcing people colonised to speak English, French, Spanish, transforming their way of life, these are genocide, right?’’, Hu Xijin, editor of China’s state-affiliated Global Times, tweeted on March 11. In a statement to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva last month, China accused Australia of violating the human rights of refugees in offshore detention centres. In Australia, some have been willing to pick up the line. Writing in John Menadue’s journal Pearls and Irritations on March 31, former DFAT officer Alison Broinowski argued human rights were a “glasshouse … stone-throwers beware”. It is an alarming sign of the times, Glenda Korporaal writes, that Mr Tehan admits he is looking to business to help make the breakthroughs in improving Australia’s strained ties with China. Mr Cheng, regrettably, took as one-eyed a view of the trade bans as he did of life in Xinjiang, blaming Australia for “the difficulties we now have in the bilateral relationship”. Repairing the economic relationship would serve both nations’ interests, as well as regional prosperity and stability. Soviet-style propaganda efforts reminiscent of the Cold War, such as that rolled out on Wednesday, offer nothing constructive.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Managing a delicate relationship	The Australian	Australian writer Yang Hengjun is in grave danger in China Veteran Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan, a respected foreign policy thinker, believes Australia’s approach to China has moved from “extreme complacency” to “over-reaction”. As Will Glasgow reported on Saturday, Mr Kausikan cited the Turnbull government’s rectifying the “absurd” situation that allowed foreign countries to donate to Australian political parties. Such action was long overdue. But when it comes to his claim of current “over-reaction” by Canberra, Mr Kausikan is on shakier ground.
News at the weekend that Chinese-born Australian writer Yang Hengjun faces trial in Beijing on an espionage charge is indicative of how the bilateral relationship has deteriorated. Dr Yang, 55, a former Chinese diplomat who worked in junior roles in China’s Ministry of State Security and became an Australian citizen in 2002, has been treated abysmally. He was detained at Guangzhou airport in January 2019 after arriving with his family from New York. Accounts have emerged of Dr Yang being subjected to brutal, daily interrogations, with his arms and legs shackled as Chinese security officials tried to “break” him and extract confessions. The conviction rate for such crimes China is high, with prosecutors relying heavily on confessions.
Since being detained, Dr Yang, who was previously healthy, has developed serious medical problems. Foreign Minister Marise Payne has called out China for what she described as the “unacceptable” treatment of an Australian citizen. No self-respecting government could do otherwise. Scott Morrison reminded Beijing on Saturday of the need for transparency and a “fair and just process” in dealing with charges that potentially carry the death penalty in China.
As Mr Morrison said, Australia “has to stand up for (all) its citizens”. That includes Chinese-born news anchor Cheng Lei, another Australian who has been detained in Beijing since mid-August. Mr Kausikan regards the Morrison government’s firm handling of the Beijing relationship as going from one extreme “to the other extreme now”. Australia, he said, was “belatedly waking up to a challenge that was there all the time – and maybe over-reacting a bit”. But from rightly doing whatever it can to help Australian citizens in detention in China to far broader issues such as the origins of COVID-19 and Chinese territorial aggression in the South China Sea, Australia is doing no more than standing up to Chinese bullying and bad behaviour, as are other nations.
China’s record on human rights also demands scrutiny, amid accounts of not just what is happening to the Uighurs and other minorities, but of Beijing’s using heavy-handed “coercive diplomacy” to strike at countries with which it is in diplomatic disputes. Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were suddenly detained on suspicion of espionage in December 2018 following the arrest in Canada of Huawei’s high-profile chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. The men have been incarcerated since, with little access to Canadian diplomats. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute notes China is also increasingly inclined to use coercive diplomacy to brazenly further its strategic objectives. The current low point in Australia’s relationship with Beijing owes much to China’s illogical, irresponsible response to the Morrison government’s call for an independent international inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. Australia’s stance won widespread global support. As the world continues to battle the plague, China does not appear to grasp the damage its obstructive attitude has caused. There is no “over-reaction” in our concern to ensure the origins of COVID-19 are investigated, and to help Australians caught up in Beijing’s opaque system of criminal justice.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Newspoll’s snapshot of life with civic trust and hope	The Australian	Australians expect their leaders to rise to severe challenges Our special Newspoll on Tuesday gives Australians a glimpse of themselves at an extraordinary moment in history. It is a time of crisis and uncertainty — and that is creating a sense of social solidarity seen in the high approval levels enjoyed by political leaders across the federation. All premiers were sitting on satisfaction ratings comfortably above 50 per cent last week, from Queensland’s Annastacia Palaszczuk at 59 per cent to Peter Gutwein in Tasmania on a staggering 90 per cent. Scott Morrison also is popular, with an approval level of 60-72 per cent across the states, while 33-44 per cent of those surveyed believe he’s handling the COVID-19 pandemic “very well”. On that same public health challenge, the leaders of the east coast states of NSW, Victoria and Queensland also get the top rating from about a third of respondents, with dramatically higher levels of approval in Western Australia and Tasmania.
What we’re seeing is citizens looking to those in government as crisis managers in the face of an unfolding pandemic with profound social, economic and human costs. It’s not a party-political story. The federation, as is usually the case, has a patchwork of parties in power, but support for leaders is across the board. In Western Australia, Labor’s Mark McGowan is in a remarkably strong position but the Prime Minister is also very popular in that state. Since April, Ms Palaszczuk has improved her standing but she would be unwise to think this will automatically translate to October’s state election, when party politics and a range of issues are likely to reassert themselves somewhat. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has taken quite a knock in the satisfaction stakes, and it’s true his leadership has stumbled. He projects a self-confidence that suits him when things are going well but otherwise shades into arrogance. Even so, there will be Liberal voters in his state whose love of Victoria makes them unembarrassed to support Mr Andrews as crisis-mode Premier.
This kind of unifying spirit is seen on a bigger scale in the national cabinet, at least when common sense prevails, and in the pragmatic working relationship between a Coalition government and the ACTU. All this is a function of threats to the national interest, and incumbency responding to a population in search of sensible leadership and decision-making that works. Just as politicians have proved able to turn down the volume of partisanship, so too the people have been willing to make sacrifices and (mostly) follow directions.
Civic approval for government is no carte blanche, although there is certainly acknowledgment that politicians deserve to be cut some slack because they must guide the nation through rapidly developing hazards with big gaps in knowledge and information. From the smallest state to the federal capital, however, leaders would be wrong to interpret high approval ratings as cause for political vanity. Instead, these results suggest popular trust and an expectation that those in government will carefully deliberate and enact competent policy to safeguard lives and livelihoods. People want their leaders not to play political games and to be as upfront as possible about the rationale for rules that impose social and economic burdens. This Newspoll snapshot captures a serious trial in the life of the nation, and serves as a reminder of the heavy responsibility on the shoulders of those elected to lead.
It’s unusual for Australians to put so much faith in government. We like to regard ourselves as individualists irreverent about politics, even cynical. This is a strand in our national character, although we lack the libertarian spirit of people who have fought revolutionary wars, and our convict past lives on in a sometimes stultifying conformism and nanny state meddling. Even so, it’s a fact many Australians right now look to government to keep them afloat, and some imagine that state patronage and ever more public debt can rescue the country. That tendency has to be resisted. Along with a temporary expansion of government, we will need individual self-reliance and risk-taking if we are to adapt and find new ways to create prosperity and jobs.
Today’s Newspoll also has interesting things to say about identity and belonging. Post-war globalisation threatened to make national identities more similar and bland — often more Americanised — although the excesses of technocratic elites led to a populist and nationalist counter-reaction seen in Donald Trump’s election, the Brexit vote and Bill Shorten’s defeat. Although COVID-19 unites the world in fear, it also makes people hunker down at home, and this is especially true for Australia as an island continent so far spared the worst of the pandemic. Our borders are closed, expats have been coming home, and if we contemplate holidays it’s a chance to discover regions of Australia unfamiliar to us. If our sense of Australianness has been intensified, so too have our regional identities. Closure of state borders — like Mr Andrews joking about the non-appeal of neighbouring South Australia — play on quite old regional rivalries, such as flare between NSW and Queensland in State of Origin football. This can be seen in Newspoll’s intense premier worship in WA and Tasmania, which have always felt detached from the establishment of the southeast mainland. A related theme is envy, with some Andrews-phobic Victorians wondering aloud about the chance of escaping to NSW as pandemic refugees. COVID has brought an even more intensely local focus, with parents working at home, and socialising more limited to family and neighbours. This is life in a cluster; whether self-reliant and self-contained in mutual goodwill, or unhappily identified as residents of a viral hot spot who must go together back into lockdown. Nobody would wish a pandemic on the world, and we hope our governments rise to the challenge of recovery, but these are also fascinating times in which to be alive.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Carbon target overshadows action	The Australian	Australia’s emissions record is on a par with that of similar nations
Despite new figures showing Australia will meet its 2030 Paris Agreement targets, the Morrison government is under pressure to declare that Australia will be carbon neutral by 2050. The carbon neutral target has been adopted by state governments and has become an article of faith among climate change campaigners. A target has been adopted by 126 countries covering 51 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and it is likely the issue will continue to dog the Morrison government in the way not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol was an ongoing distraction for the Howard administration.
Not declaring a 2050 target leaves an easy mark for the federal opposition, just as John Howard’s refusal to ratify Kyoto did for Kevin Rudd. But so far, the Morrison government is sticking with Australia’s traditional position of not promising something it does not know how to deliver. Australia’s official position is to be carbon neutral sometime in the second half of the century. Other nations have not been so shy.
As the UN Emissions Gap report shows, many nations have been quick to talk a big game on carbon neutrality but slow to deliver on substance. The report says the growing number of countries committing to net-zero emissions goals by mid-century is the most significant climate change policy development of the year. But it says there is an inconsistency between the emission levels implied by current policies and those necessary for achieving net-zero emissions by the middle of the century.
It appears some countries have used a carbon neutral pledge to distract from a lack of action in nearer timeframes, with most countries’ pledges not sufficient to meet the Paris 2030 goals, let alone 2050. Australia was not singled out in the UN report but was judged line ball to achieving its 2030 target, which itself will fall short of what is required for the Paris Agreement goals. The report was prepared before the latest official figures that showed Australia was only 56 million tonnes short of hitting its 2030 target without using Kyoto carry-over credits.
Despite the disapproval heaped on the government, Australia’s record comparative to similar countries has not been that bad. On a per person basis, Australia is deploying renewables 25 per cent faster than Europe’s four largest economies combined and 10 times faster than the global average. Australia’s emissions reduction efforts have compared favourably with like nations on the latest available figures. Between 2005 and 2018, Australia cut absolute emissions by 13 per cent compared with 15 per cent in Germany, 8 per cent in Japan, 1 per cent in New Zealand, 10 per cent in the US and 0.1 per cent in Canada. On a per capita basis, Australia cut emissions by 29 per cent compared with 16 per cent in Germany, 7 per cent in Japan, 16 per cent in NZ, 19 per cent in the US and 13 per cent in Canada.
On December 4, the British government announced an increased 2030 target, but Britain’s Climate Change Committee has said delivering a net-zero target by 2050 is technically feasible but highly challenging.
The big issue on emissions, however, remains what happens in the developing world. Big emissions cuts in the developed world are quickly being overshadowed by rising emissions in Asia, where coal developments continue apace. China, the world’s biggest emitter, has said it will try to become carbon neutral by 2060 but has given no details on how this might happen.
Australia can expect more pressure at a global online climate meeting on Saturday where nations are being urged to promise to do more. And there has been a lot of talk that Australia will be further isolated on climate change action under a Joe Biden presidency in the US. But Australia has worked closely and well with the US on the issue across administrations. A close reading of Mr Biden’s plans show they align well with Australia’s commitment to a technology-led solution. As the UN Emissions Gap report demonstrates, Australia is not so far out of step with substantive global action as many would suggest.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Cormann’s lesson in the virtue of keeping promises	The Australian	Australia’s green record compares well with those of global critics The appointment of Mathias Cormann to head the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provides a timely snapshot of where Australia really stands in global affairs, including on the issue of action on climate change. Mr Cormann was successful despite a frantic international campaign by green groups to undermine his candidacy because of what they said was Australia’s poor record on dealing with climate change. In a letter to the OECD search committee and ambassadors of OECD member countries, the heads of major Australian and international charities urged them to block Mr Cormann’s bid because of his personal and political track record of blocking action on climate change. Signatories to the letter included Greenpeace, Oxfam Australia and The Australian Conservation Foundation.
Greens leader Adam Bandt directly lobbied the EU ambassador to oppose Mr Cormann on the basis of Australia’s climate change policies and continued coal production. But, as Dennis Shanahan revealed on Tuesday, Mr Cormann won the support of key European countries and the top OECD job by sticking to the facts. He managed to turn a perceived weakness — Australia’s international position on climate change — into a strength. On his travels to lobby for the position, Mr Cormann carried with him a colour-coded spreadsheet listing all the commitments of OECD members to greenhouse gas emissions targets and what they had actually done. When it came down to targets reached, Australia’s performance stood up well against some other members.
Mr Cormann’s campaign with the OECD mirrored the Morrison government’s efforts since the election to break the perception domestically that we are not doing enough. In fact, Australia has been deploying renewables 25 per cent faster than Europe’s four largest economies combined, and 10 times faster than the global average. On a per capita basis between 2005 and 2018, Australia cut emissions by 29 per cent compared with 16 per cent in Germany, 7 per cent in Japan, 16 per cent in New Zealand, 19 per cent in the US and 13 per cent in Canada.
The message is that making promises without backing them up with action is a meaningless gesture. Mr Cormann’s experience is in keeping with how Australia is received in private meetings within the UN’s climate change framework. Other leaders within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change have been impressed with Australia’s pioneering work on green financing, auctioning of carbon permits and developing methodologies for land-based solutions.
There have been numerous stock takes that confirm promises are falling well short of Paris Agreement pledges. All countries are grappling with the issue of how to make sure that promises made can be delivered. Mr Cormann was able to demonstrate that Australia has a good track record of doing what it says it will do. This is why Energy Minister Angus Taylor is pushing hard to make sure corporations deliver on promises they make as well. Sustainable development and carbon dioxide savings is a boom sector internationally but there is strong evidence much of what is claimed about corporate environmental responsibility is little more than greenwash. The net is tightening, however, both on government and industry. Wealth editor James Kirby reported in the Business Australian on Tuesday how the EU has moved to stamp out notoriously loose standards around so-called ESG (environmental, social and governance). It has set mandatory rules that will cover any financial institution operating inside European borders. Under the EU’s new Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, all companies will have to present tangible and measurable plans on ESG products and progress. As with reporting on climate change, the single biggest failing in the ESG area has been a lack of policing and accountability.
Mr Cormann’s approach to his OECD bid, demonstrating tangible results rather than promises, fits well with the OECD’s mandate to work on establishing evidence-based international standards and finding solutions to a range of social, economic and environmental challenges. In a statement accepting his appointment, Mr Cormann said “different countries and regions around the world have different opportunities to make the strongest possible contribution to our collective emissions-reduction outcomes and the net-zero emissions target locked into the Paris Agreement. We all face similar transition challenges and can all agree that effective global action on climate change is a must and we must get to net-zero emissions as soon as possible”. Australia has received welcome support for its commitment to research and development of new technologies. As Ben Packham reports on Wednesday, the EU ambassador to Australia, Michael Pulch, highlighted the federal government’s technology road map as one way to upgrade ambitions to cut emissions in the future. As things stand, Scott Morrison says Australia wants to be net emissions-neutral as soon as possible but will use technologies not taxes to get there. The diplomatic pressure is on Australia to declare a net-zero target for 2050 but Dr Pulch suggested technological advances were part of that package. Without a target, Australia could face a planned carbon border levy in the EU, which could penalise exports of steel and aluminium. But Dr Pulch says the new rules could benefit Australia’s ambitions for new industries in green hydrogen and rare earths. The bottom line is there is a long road before any EU border taxes will take effect, particularly given a commitment that they will comply with WTO rules. In the meantime, Australia is well served making promises it can keep and building credibility by sticking to them.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Lessons from our longest war	The Australian	Australia’s ongoing role in Afghanistan is due for a review Former special forces officer Mark Wales deserves the gratitude of the nation for his service in Afghanistan. That a man who has worn the coveted sandy beret of the Special Air Service Regiment has expressed disillusionment and regret for his service and has questioned the value of the sacrifice of his mates is heart-rending. Mr Wales need feel no shame at his service. He served this country bravely and with pure motive. His despair should inspire serious soul-searching among our senior political and military leadership.
Few Australians probably realise that we still have troops in Afghanistan. Following 9/11, it was justifiable to unleash military force against al-Qa’ida and its Taliban hosts. The Taliban refused to dismantle al-Qa’ida terrorist training camps and hand over Osama bin Laden. While it was not until 2011 that bin Laden was located and killed by US forces, al-Qa’ida’s ability to mount global operations from Afghanistan was destroyed by 2002.
Mr Wales argued on Monday that our troops had no discernible strategic objective on his last deployment in 2010. If so, what is our national interest in Afghanistan today?
Many special forces veterans echo Mr Wales’s concerns. They know their normal role of stealthy insertion into the battlespace, reconnaissance and surveillance, followed by extraction, was modified to meet an unstated political expedient. Successive governments sought to avoid casualties among our conventional land forces. They expanded the role of the SAS to include so-called decapitation missions against Taliban leaders as well as larger kill or capture raids. These customarily had been the role of commandos or light infantry. Our elite troops are superb: tough, resilient, patriotic. They are among the best elite forces in the world. They knew they were being misemployed to meet the political exigency of providing a visible presence, for Australia to be considered a reliable US ally while minimising the risk of casualties. The misemployment created moral hazards. The intelligence on which some targets were identified was dubious. Some in the special forces felt they were exploited to settle old tribal feuds. Multiple tours exacted a heavy psychological toll. This may have spawned a culture of indiscriminate use of force inside the SAS Regiment.
They saw Australians being killed by Afghan allies who they were risking their lives to support. For every target they eliminated, a new, more fanatical leader would emerge. Frustrations with this ambiguous, thankless mission may have led to an indifference to human life among some of our troops. It is easy to judge them from the comfort of a newsroom or a parliamentary office. As Donald Trump pushes to get US troops home as soon as possible, it is time Australia reviewed our remaining presence in Afghanistan. It is also time we reviewed the flawed strategy that forced invidious decisions on our troops. If war crimes were committed then lay charges or let our veterans get on with their lives. The worst moral failures of the Afghanistan war did not all occur on the battlefield.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
China must cast secrecy aside	The Australian	Australia’s response to the virus has been efficient and swift
Beijing’s achievement in building two fully equipped 1000-bed hospitals in less than two weeks to deal with the coronavirus outbreak shows there is much to praise in its handling of a profoundly challenging crisis. So does the way it managed to quarantine Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and then 16 other cities with a combined population of over 60 million, despite Orwellian aspects of the process, with drones used to hunt down citizens without face masks. With a few delays, it has enabled countries such as Australia to evacuate citizens.
There is, however, a darker side to China’s handling of the emergency, which shows Beijing has not fully grasped the lessons of the 2002-03 SARS outbreak and the self-defeating attempts made then to cover it up. Friday’s death at Wuhan Central Hospital of 33-year-old Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist who was one of the first medical professionals who tried to sound the alarm about the “mysterious” virus, and then contracted it himself, reflects poorly on Chinese authorities. On December 30, Dr Li warned a small group of fellow doctors about a previously unknown illness that had caused seven patients at his hospital to be quarantined. Four days later he was arrested, hauled off to the notorious Public Security Bureau, and forced to sign a confession that he had been spreading “false rumours” that “disturbed the social order”. Chinese authorities had become aware of the new illness in early December, but did not disclose it to the World Health Organisation until January 1, when they claimed they had stopped it in its tracks and there was no evidence of human-to-human contagion. Ten days later, Beijing admitted that was false.
Between January 1 and January 20, as Rowan Callick wrote on Saturday, authorities downplayed the issue, with the Communist Party’s flagship People’s Daily not publishing a word about the outbreak. Officials also expunged or censored any online discussion of the issue. Not until around January 10 did they share details of the virus’s genetic code with the WHO.
It is not surprising that last Friday’s news of Dr Li’s death triggered “online uproar” in China. International news agencies estimated a staggering 1.5 billion views of posts in an online revolt against Chinese attempts to play down the issue. Among the posts were videos of the Les Miserables song, Do You Hear the People Sing?. Other comments invoked Article 35 of China’s constitution stipulating free speech, and phrases from For Whom the Bell Tolls. Xi Jinping, facing the most intense public anger since he took power in 2012, has declared a “people’s war”, dispatching 1400 military doctors to Wuhan.
Australia’s hope, Education Minister Dan Tehan said on Sunday, was for “some sort of a breakthrough” in the next few weeks with the coronavirus outbreak, amid concerns that 106,000 Chinese students — 56 per cent of those enrolled this semester — cannot enter Australia. Standard & Poor’s estimates universities could lose up to $3.1bn in fees if students are unable to study in the first semester.
But the Morrison government’s ban on inbound travellers from China is a sensible strand of the essential measures it has enacted to protect Australians from the spread of the virus. Holding Australian evacuees from Wuhan in quarantine on Christmas Island was an important precaution. To date, an Australian girl in quarantine on the island remains the only person among 270 Australians and permanent residents who has been tested for the virus. The test returned a negative result. Last week, 35 Australians were transferred to Christmas Island from an evacuation flight to Auckland. And on Sunday, Australia’s second flight from Wuhan landed in Darwin, carrying 250 people who are now in quarantine at an old mining camp outside the city.With 37,552 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 813 deaths, exceeding the toll from SARS, Australia has no choice but to persevere with safety precautions that will cost the education, tourism and other export sectors dearly for the foreseeable future.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Cruise ship measures all at sea	The Australian	Authorities must be guided by medical advice on shut downs
A fortnight ago, COVID-19 cases in Australia totalled 91. A week ago, it was 376. The number is now more than 1300 and multiplying. Rather than a flattening curve, the tally is a skyrocketing line, which warrants the latest shutdowns and restrictions announced by authorities. As Scott Morrison says, what happened on Bondi Beach on Saturday was not okay. Likewise the crowds of mainly young people, with their cavalier sense of invincibility, packed into clubs and bars. Calling a halt with shutdowns and closed borders as state and territory leaders are doing, is essential. Likewise the Prime Minister’s insistence that non-essential domestic travel must stop for now. As individuals and as a nation we need to heed the warnings of expatriate Aussies in Italy — nonchalance is deadly. Authorities themselves, however, need to do a much better job of protecting the public in some instances. The Ruby Princess cruise ship fiascos are a prime example.
On Saturday, The Weekend Australian revealed the vessel had previously docked in Sydney on March 8 with 158 sick passengers aboard, 13 of whom had high temperatures on arrival. It is not clear why, hours later, it was permitted to leave Sydney for New Zealand without undergoing quarantining or disinfection, carrying 2700 new passengers and 1100 crew.
On Sunday, NSW Health confirmed to Yoni Bashan that 18 cases of COVID-19 originating from the Ruby Princess have now been diagnosed since the 2700 passengers, returned from their cruise, were allowed to leave the ship on Thursday. Two of those diagnosed are in the Northern Territory. It is impossible to say how many people may have caught the virus from those infected. And the scramble is on to track down each person who was on board to ensure they are self-isolating. While the nine tests for COVID-19 from the first cruise were negative, testing from both cruises should have gone much wider because the virus is asymptomatic in some people. Serious slip-ups in safety precautions, especially on a large scale, can cost lives, devastating families.
Decisions about closing schools, shutting down bars, restaurants, clubs, libraries and community sporting events need to be guided by medical authorities, with governments and organisations erring on the side of caution if in doubt. School closures will bring their own challenges. The AFL’s decision to suspend competition until at least June is wise and pragmatic. However popular, professional sport, even when played in empty stadiums, cannot be above the rules followed by the wider community.Elderly people, including those in nursing homes, are our most vulnerable citizens in the crisis and deserve special consideration. Quarantining is vital. And loved ones who are in contact must keep a safe distance. But the rules need to be implemented with common sense and compassion, especially for patients in palliative care and for older people whose health and wellbeing would suffer more harm than good through prolonged isolation and loneliness.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

Rather than a flattening curve, the tally is a skyrocketing line, which warrants the latest shutdowns and restrictions announced on Sunday night.

Perseverance is key after grimmest Covid-19 day	The Australian	Authorities must hold their nerve and finetune responses The best response to the nation’s worst day of the COVID-19 pandemic so far is co-operation and efficiency, not panicking and playing the blame game. Neither should we forget the need for empathy, especially in regard to the tragedy unfolding in Victorian nursing homes as relatives despair over the fate of loved ones. Three weeks after the lockdown was reimposed in metropolitan Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire, and a week after masks were made compulsory across those regions, Victoria’s 723 new cases and 13 deaths, including 10 nursing home residents, announced on Thursday, set new records. So far the restrictions have not produced the results that were hoped for. Containing the spiral to avoid the caseload doubling and doubling again is vital, as Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says. Doing so will depend on public compliance with measures to prevent community transmission and on better application of those measures by health authorities, police and the Australian Defence Force. NSW and Queensland also are facing challenges. But responses must be proportionate.
Queensland, with 11 active COVID cases, including three new cases in the past 24 hours and no COVID patients in intensive care, has gone to extremes in reclosing its border to Sydneysiders. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, three months from an election, may think that will be popular. But it will take a heavy toll on workers, their families and small businesses in the state’s struggling hospitality sector. The state needs to be protected from any further financial hurt. Testing must be boosted; Brisbane people queued for hours on Thursday. And the behaviour of three young women who allegedly flew to Melbourne, returned with the virus and worked, shopped and socialised around Brisbane for eight days shows how hard it is to prevent stupidity.
At this stage, Victorians can improve their economic prospects by co-operating with the restrictions in place for their protection. Mr Andrews is correct when he says that if people continue going to work when they have coronavirus symptoms, or when they are awaiting test results, case numbers will continue to grow “and restrictions will have to stay on”. Fair enough. But his government’s Department of Health and Human Services must speed up the return of COVID test results and the tracing process as much as possible. Waiting for a week for results or for tracing after a positive diagnosis, as some Melburnians complain, is leaving many people confused, demoralised and untested. On Tuesday, Australian Medical Association Victoria Council chairman Mukesh Haikerwal, a Melbourne GP, told The Australian he was ignoring bureaucrats’ advice not to test family members or work colleagues of people with COVID-19 unless they have symptoms or a letter from the DHHS confirming them as a close contact. Dr Haikerwal is right to do so. As Rachel Baxendale reported, delays have resulted in some people waiting longer than the 14-day quarantine period for the department to officially confirm them as close contacts of an infected person. Such delays create manifold opportunities for transmission of the highly contagious virus, especially if those waiting to be contacted for testing are reluctant to be isolated.
From Thursday, employers must notify WorkSafe immediately when they become aware of a worker testing positive. That makes sense. So does the wearing of masks across Victoria, and ADF personnel and public health workers knocking on the doors of every positive coronavirus case in the state. That was necessitated by door-knockers recently discovering 29 people were not at home when they were meant to be self-isolating. The appalling news that three deceased residents were left in their beds for hours after their deaths at Epping Gardens nursing home in Melbourne’s north highlights the pressures on the aged-care sector. To date, 59 aged-care residents have died in the second wave and 456 residents are COVID positive. The worst-affected nursing homes need and are receiving extra support from interstate and across the health sector. The problem is far wider, however. Only 10 per cent of Thursday’s new cases were linked to aged-care homes. To put Australia’s situation in perspective, our 16,000 cases and 189 deaths from the virus compare with 4.5 million cases and 150,000 deaths in the US, with 13 times our population. For the elderly and others with the virus and those trying to avoid it, the only options, without a vaccine, are isolating as needed, distancing, hygiene, testing and tracing. But deliverance will take time.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Deadly menace of family violence must be quelled	The Australian	Authorities must redraw their strategies to protect victims
No legislation, however prescriptive, can entirely eradicate violence and coercion or ensure civilised behaviour behind closed doors. Police, welfare service agencies or the legal system, however proactive their strategies, cannot eliminate domestic violence. That said, our society must do far more to prevent it, reduce its deadly consequences and free its victims from fear and torment. An outpouring of revelations and vigorous discussion since ex-footballer Rowan Baxter, 41, killed wife Hannah Clarke, 31, and their three young children when he ambushed their car, doused them in petrol and set them alight on their way to school in Brisbane 10 days ago have thrown up pointers as to where authorities should start.
The size of the problem needs to be acknowledged, however grim a picture it paints of our society. The latest data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reveals one woman is killed every nine days and one man is killed every 29 days by a partner. One in six women and one in 16 men have experienced physical or sexual violence from a current or previous cohabiting partner. Specialist homeless services assisted 26,500 children aged nine and younger due to domestic violence in 2017-18. Disabled people and Aborigines are among those most at risk of suffering domestic violence. Nor are those in same-sex relationships immune. The problem is universal.
Domestic violence protection orders are effective in many cases, but a more effective system is needed. Authorities should pay closer attention to cases where complainants report abuse by perpetrators with a history of domstic violence.
DVOs are in place in one-third of domestic and family violence killings in Queensland. Baxter had a DVO against him and was facing a charge of breaching it when he murdered Ms Clarke and their ­ children and then killed himself. Her final months were marked by ­repeated contact with the system that failed to protect her. She had every reason to be frightened of her estranged husband. As national crime correspondent David Murray revealed last week, Baxter had told her how he had planned to murder a former partner and young son from a previous relationship.
Support services and police resources, being limited, should be applied to help abuse victims when they are at their most vulnerable — at the time they are attempting to break free from perpetrators, or in the months immediately afterwards. White Ribbon Australia, which focuses on preventing men’s violence against women, reports women are especially vulnerable to post-separation violence and intimidation, including stalking, threats of murder, abuse of children and sexual assault.
Men’s advocates highlight the plight of male victims. Those victims also deserve support. But to put the issue in context, from 2010 to 2014, fewer women (28) killed their male partners than males killed their female partners (121). The majority of women who killed their male partners were domstic violence victims of those men. That was not the case with the vast majority of the male killers.
On Saturday, Sarah Elks focused on the issue of “coercive control’’ in domestic relationships — threats, intimidation, isolation from friends, family and work, and other demeaning behaviour. Such highly controlling conduct, Women’s Legal Service Queensland chief executive Angela Lynch said, was a “red flag for murder’’. For that reason, the states have good reason to examine the pros and cons of legislating to create a new domestic violence criminal offence­ of “coercive control”. As Elks writes on Monday, domestic violence survivors are also set to gain a direct voice to policymakers, with the Palaszczuk government considering a Victorian-style council for victims and survivors. Consultation makes sense.Those who have endured and survived relationships in which basic human decency is as elusive as gold dust are well placed to advise authorities on how to tackle a dark social issue. But finding solutions to this shameful blight on our society will be complex and difficult.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Middle East’s shifting sands	The Australian	Bahrain’s establishing ties with Israel is a positive move Bahrain’s decision to defy Palestinian fury and become the fourth Arab state to establish full diplomatic ties with Israel adds momentum to the strategic realignment across the Middle East. It follows a similar move by the UAE last month, and last week’s rejection by the 22-nation Arab League of Palestinian demands for Arab states to denounce any country normalising relations with the Jewish state.
The decisions by Manama and Abu Dhabi fly in the face of the decades-old belief that Israel was doomed to remain a pariah from Arab neighbours unless it gave in to Palestinian demands. The new ties add to Israel’s peace deals with Egypt (in 1979) and Jordan (1994). They are a consequence of Donald Trump’s “Peace to Prosperity” vision, based on growing opposition among moderate Sunni states to Shi’ite Iran’s rampant imperialism. Sudan and Oman could follow. Given the close relations between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, there is little doubt authorities in Manama would not have acted without Riyadh’s concurrence. The shifting sands are also evident in the way Qatar, normally a Palestinian backer, has been quietly working with Israel to broker a ceasefire with Hamas terrorists ruling Gaza. Countries in the region are more willing than ever to prioritise their own interests over Palestinians’, raising a ray of hope for peace. As Dr Colin Rubenstein of the Australia-Israel & Jewish Affairs Council says, the new deals have the potential to transform a volatile region.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Raising intelligence questions	The Australian	Balancing security and civil liberties is a delicate process The federal government bears no greater responsibility than its duty to protect Australian sovereignty and the safety and liberty of our people.
Australian Signals Directorate boss Rachel Noble emerged from the shadowy world of signals intelligence and cyber security to deliver a public address at the Australian National University on Tuesday. In a discursive reflection on the history of the ASD and its predecessors, the director-general sought to assure Australians that this nation possessed state-of-the-art capabilities to protect our interests in the dangerous age of multi-domain warfare, transnational terrorism and attempts by foreign states to influence our political, business and academic institutions. Ms Noble stated a self-evident truth when she lamented: “I’m sorry if this is news to you but not all Australians are the good guys. Some Australians are agents of a foreign power. Some Australians are terrorists. Some Australians take up weapons and point them at us and our military. Some Australians are spies who are cultivated by foreign powers and are not on our side.” Her bleak assessment is not news to most of us. Few sensible Australians would argue against her proposition.
The bloody Lindt Cafe siege demonstrated that in the era of global jihadist terror, Australia is not immune to violence. Numerous planned attacks on our soil have been foiled without attracting notoriety. Some, such as the planned attack on the army’s Holsworthy Barracks, resulted in public criminal trials. Others attracted no attention. We know only through oblique references to thwarted schemes in intelligence reports to parliament that we averted danger.
Clandestine operations to secure our lives and liberty are essential. And, as Ms Noble stressed, the nature of many of our cyber capabilities must remain secret. Every sovereign state maintains such capabilities. Since the 9/11 attacks on the US, the Bali bombings and terrorism in Madrid and London, Australian courts have extended considerable deference to the executive in the application of measures designed to protect us against mass-casualty attacks. More recently, attacks on critical infrastructure and theft of intellectual property have emerged as grave, recurrent threats. Against all of this we must deploy the best minds and means at our disposal.
It would be a Pyrrhic victory indeed, however, if we undermined our liberties or irreparably damaged our democratic institutions to protect them. While seeking to reassure, Ms Noble’s soothing language raised troubling questions. The ASD, she stressed, had neither the power nor the desire to engage in “mass surveillance” of Australians inside Australia. What does that mean precisely? Does the ASD aspire to target individual Australians in Australia? Has it sought such power from the government? If not, why were media organisations and journalists raided for merely speculating that such measures were being considered? Providing answers to these questions does not infringe on justifiable secrecy as to how the ASD conducts its operations. But it goes to the heart of the accountability that our intelligence community must expect as servants of a free nation whose system of government is contingent on a free press. The heavy-handed Australian Federal Police raid on News Corp Australia journalist Annika Smethurst in April last year was a stark contrast to the nostalgic reveries of Ms Noble about the history of the organisation she leads. With the power and capabilities the ASD wields comes commensurate responsibility. If the ASD is operating entirely as it has since inception, why did Smethurst’s story about proposals to authorise it to operate within Australia arouse such a disproportionate response? May we infer that the exclusion of “mass surveillance” is not a guise for some domestic operational role? If such measures are being contemplated within our intelligence community, we need to be assured they will be subject to rigorous parliamentary and judicial oversight. They may be necessary in the dystopian world Ms Noble seeks to defend us against. Demanding proper processes be followed need not impede the capacity to do this.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
China stymies the Wuhan probe	The Australian	Barring WHO’s team will fuel suspicions about the origin of COVID
The World Health Organisation’s Beijing-friendly director-general, Tedros Ghebreyesus, has good reason to be “very disappointed” by the obstacles put up by China that are preventing an international scientific team going to Wuhan to investigate the origins of the COVID -19 pandemic. The brazen obstruction by the Chinese Communist Party regime is outrageous. It is an affront to the global community after virtually all 194 WHO countries at the World Health Assembly last May — including China itself, albeit reluctantly — supported the call for a full, independent investigation first made by Scott Morrison. China’s action is CCP malfeasance and arrogance at its worst, in the face of almost two million deaths, intense suffering and economic devastation wrought by the virus. It raises the question: what is there to hide?
After months of trying to overcome what it termed “a barrage of (Chinese) logistic demands and rules”, the 10-member WHO team of eminent virologists finally was due to deploy to Wuhan on Tuesday. Instead, with scientists on their way to China, Dr Tedros, in a rare rebuke to Beijing, had to announce that “Chinese officials have not finalised the necessary permission for the team’s arrival” so it could not proceed. “I’m very disappointed,” he said, adding he had been “assured China is speeding up the internal procedures for the earliest possible deployment”.
Dr Tedros’s sidekick, WHO emergencies program director Michael Ryan, claimed the problem was a lack of visa clearances for the team — eight months after the WHA voted for speedy action. “We trust and hope that this is just a logistic and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly,” he said. WHO officials’ willingness to accept such a lame explanation defies credulity. But it fits their pattern of lavishing praise on Beijing that has been evident from the start of the pandemic. After Dr Tedros and Dr Ryan met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on January 28 last year, Dr Tedros gushed: “The speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with the WHO and the world are very impressive and beyond words. China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response. It’s not an exaggeration.” Really?
That, incredibly, was said after China covered up the virus for 12 days following its formal notification to the WHO of the Wuhan outbreak on December 31, 2019. Virologists believe that delay seriously impaired the world’s response. Dr Tedros and Dr Ryan will do further damage to what remains of the WHO’s standing if they persist in being indulgent towards China.
The WHA left no doubt the entire global community, and not only Australia, wants a full investigation into the pandemic. China’s feral reaction to the Prime Minister’s sensible suggestion was, and continues to be, excessive and irrational. Not investigating the origins of the outbreak is also detrimental to China’s interests if it wants to prevent future pandemics. After Dr Tedros’s January 28 meeting with Mr Xi last year, a WHO statement said: “The two sides agreed that WHO will send international experts to visit China as soon as possible to work with Chinese counterparts on increasing understanding of the outbreak to guide global response efforts.” There should have been no delay in getting the mission started. The CCP is determined to persevere in its false narrative that China bears no responsibility for the pandemic. The need for the truth to emerge is compelling. In a Zoom call to politicians around the world, US deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger claimed intelligence evidence suggested coronavirus was leaked from a Chinese biological weapons research laboratory 17km from the Wuhan “wet market”. Dr Tedros and the international community must insist on a rigorous investigation, without obstructions. The WHO is letting the world down in its supine response to Beijing’s behaviour, which has the hallmarks of a rogue state.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL The 1 that we want: How will it work?	The Northern Advocate	Barring a second surge of positive Covid-19 results, the Government was set to announce further details on how we move to an alert level 1.
The official definition of level 1 is “the disease is contained in New Zealand” and our authorities, particularly director general of health Ashley Bloomfield, will need to be convinced that is the case.
For this to occur, we must remain clear of community transmission — when infection spreads from one person to another without any direct link to the foreign source of infection. New Zealand on Tuesday sat at 47 days clear of community transmission.
After being deemed clear of community transmission, the Government may still move to alert level 1 despite Covid-19 remaining uncontrolled overseas and with the possibility of isolated household transmission occurring in New Zealand.
Border entry measures will be in place to minimise the risk of importing Covid-19 cases. Just how this will look will be intensely anticipated by many, including tourism operators and the international education sector.
The new normal under alert level 1 for those reliant on an influx of people will not be anything like the old normal, however.
Massey University demographer Paul Spoonley warned: “In terms of tourists and migrants, we’re probably looking at a halt for two, three or four years.”
An intensive testing regime will remain in place at alert level 1 for Covid-19. This is essential for nipping any border intrusion or failure of contact isolation in the bud.
Rapid contact tracing will be required of any positive case. The “digital diary” app launched yesterday will be a welcome advance on attempts by retailers and eateries who devised systems ranging from the hopelessly naive to overblown intrusions.
Self-isolation and quarantine will still be required, particularly for those who have visited, or been in close contact with someone who has visited, a territory where Covid-19 is uncontrolled.
The restriction that has vexed church-goers and nightclubbers will be lifted and there will be no restrictions on gatherings.
There’ll be no restrictions on domestic transport either, but people will be urged to avoid public transport or travel, if sick. Safe practice is the new normal and will be here to stay, even beyond level 1. Aotearoa has “effectively eliminated” Covid-19 — we can look forward to when we are 1.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease

Test rivalry unites strong allies	The Australian	Battle for the Border-Gavaskar trophy will be a summer highlight “What do they know of cricket that only cricket know?” That profound question was posed by West Indian Marxist intellectual CLR James, whose book Beyond a Boundary adorns the bookshelves of even the most conservative cricket purists. James understood that Test cricket is inseparable from national identity. Its spirit is poetic and indefinable. While he railed against colonialism and capitalism, he loved the game exported to the colonies by the British. Those who love the cricket as much as James did know that it is more than a game. Sometimes it wends its excruciating way to inconclusive draws. More often it reveals individual and national character.
Test cricket, played over days on unpredictable surfaces, is the ultimate trial of skill and mental toughness. It has endured despite the challenge of more ephemeral short forms of the game. James grasped this long before anyone ever heard of the Big Bash: “Cricket is first and foremost a dramatic spectacle. It belongs with theatre ballet, opera and dance.” Such lofty sentiments will not be foremost in the minds of millions of Australians and Indian fans who will head to the Adelaide Oval or tune in to descriptions of play across a plethora of media platforms on Thursday afternoon. After a year in which COVID-19 has robbed us of so much, Cricket Australia and the Board of Control for Cricket in India deserve commendation for their ingenuity and determination in ensuring that the struggle for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia is even taking place.
As Australian skipper Tim Paine wrote on Tuesday, his team regards victory over India as the pinnacle of achievement in this era. Indian coach Ravi Shastri echoed that view. Victory over Australia, in Australia, now represents the ultimate measure of excellence for Indian players and their vast passionate army of fans at home. Few Australians understand the incredible emotional attachment of Indians to their national team, or the long and noble association between our two nations. As legendary Indian batsman Rahul Dravid said in his eloquent Bradman Oration at the Australian War Memorial in 2011, Indian soldiers went ashore with the Anzacs on April 25, 1915. More than 1300 of them died on that fatal shore. And as former prime minister Tony Abbott reminds readers, Indian soldiers fought shoulder to shoulder with us in both world wars of the 20th century and in Korea. This is a relationship forged in blood and sustained by shared values and institutions.
As China continues to coerce nations across the Indo-Pacific region, our deep historical connections with India ultimately may form the bedrock of a more formal alliance. Strategic policymakers have spoken about the potential of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the US, Japan, Australia and India for years. Only last month, Australia dispatched HMAS Ballarat to participate in the Malabar naval exercises with the navies of those democratic powers. The decision to resume naval collaboration with the US, Japan and India was a sound move by the Morrison government. Australia had been absent from the Malabar exercises since 2007. With our most recent defence white paper identifying the wider Indo-Pacific as crucial to our freedom of action and supply chain access, such partnerships are vital.
Scott Morrison has built on the foundations laid by Mr Abbott, who was the first G20 leader to visit newly elected Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2014. In connecting with Mr Modi via Zoom for a summit in June, the Prime Minister demonstrated his personal commitment to Australia’s trading and military ties to the emerging superpower.
There is more at stake than a trophy named after two wonderful cricketers when the teams take the field for the opening Test. We look forward to a tough, competitive series. Obviously, we would love to see Australia avenge the loss to India in 2018-19. Although the home side has been disrupted by injuries, exciting new prospects such as Cameron Green appear ready to make a mark. Sadly for the visitors, captain Virat Kohli will play only this Test before heading home to attend the birth of his first child. But the visitors have prolific run-getters to cover his absence. There are no real losers in a contest of this calibre. The Indo-Australian relationship is built on solid foundations. Cricket is a shared language of the heart for our peoples. History made us comrades before we were competitors. And its march seems likely to entwine our destinies more closely. We welcome our rivals.

China delays pandemic probe	The Australian	Beijing and the WHO are damaging their global reputations
It was wishful thinking to believe China would do the right thing after the World Health Assembly voted unanimously in May to back the inquiry into COVID-19 proposed first by Scott Morrison. The extent to which it is brazenly running interference in what appears to be a deliberate tactic aimed at delaying the inquiry from getting off the ground, however, should disturb even Beijing’s ardent apologists at the World Health Organisation in Geneva. Reports speak of WHO plans to deploy a multinational team of investigators in China this month having been abandoned after an advance party of two scientists — an epidemiologist and an animal health specialist — sent to prepare the ground got no further than isolation in a quarantine hotel.
They speak too of “scepticism China will ever co-operate with the UN health body’s mission”, despite last week’s announcement of former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president and Nobel Peace prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as co-leaders of the investigation. There is, the reports say, no agreement yet on the mission’s terms of reference, where investigators will be allowed to go, whom they can meet, what Chinese data they may be permitted access to and which scenarios relating to the spread of the virus they will be allowed to look into. China wants the mission to focus narrowly on how the virus jumped from animals to humans rather than delve into the source of the pandemic. It is adamant there is no evidence COVID-19 originated in China, despite Wuhan universally having been acknowledged as ground zero for the pandemic. In return for allowing access to WHO investigators, Beijing’s Communist Party leaders are said to be trying to manipulate the probe so it focuses less on China and more on the spread to other countries. This is not what the WHA intended when 153 countries voted in good faith for a comprehensive, broadbased inquiry into the provenance and spread of COVID-19. Even China, after peevishly fighting tooth and nail against the Prime Minister’s initial proposal, voted for the inquiry when it found itself isolated at the assembly. When known coronavirus infections across the world each day are more than 250,000, and the global total so far is fast approaching 15 million, with more than 600,000 deaths, the world is crying out for answers about the pandemic. By failing to take the action needed to quickly facilitate an inquiry that is as much in its own interests as those of the rest of the world, Beijing is further damaging its international standing. The WHO also is not doing much for its reputation by singing from its usual discredited song sheet when it comes to Beijing, with senior official Michael Ryan saying he is “very pleased with the collaboration so far”. The world is in the throes of the gravest health challenge it has confronted in many decades. The need for a full accounting of the virus is urgent. China must not be allowed to stand in the way.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
A further blow to Hong Kong	The Australian	Beijing is determined to deny pro-democracy voters a say Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam is fooling nobody with her specious claim that the pandemic is to blame for Legislative Council elections, due on September 6, being postponed for a year. She may be Beijing’s fawning handmaid, but she cannot escape the truth that the postponement is another cynical blow to what little remains of the democratic aspects of the “one country, two systems” agreement China solemnly committed itself to at the time of Britain’s 1997 handover.
“There is absolutely no political agenda,” she said without any sign of embarrassment in announcing the delay. “I am only paying attention to the current pandemic situation.” Really? Singapore and South Korea have both recently held democratic elections, despite COVID-19.
Hong Kong has seen a spike in cases of late. Ms Lam has been exploiting this for all its worth, claiming Hong Kong was on the verge of a major community outbreak that threatened the hospital system. In fact, with 3398 cases and 33 deaths since January it has done better than many places. It remains a model for infection control.
It is little wonder opposition Legislative Council member Claudia Mo condemned the postponement as “a sleazy, contemptible act to help thwart any victory on the part of the democrats”. This was backed by prominent democratic campaigner Joshua Wong, who condemned “the most scandalous’’ era of fraud in Hong Kong’s history. He was among 12 democrats disqualified by Chinese authorities from standing for election.
Junking of the election is designed to overcome the incontrovertible reality that every poll among Hong Kong’s 4.4 million registered voters (out of a population of 7.5 million) shows overwhelming support for the democrats and their campaign against China’s oppressive rule. The point of China’s not holding the election is palpably to close off one of the few remaining forums for Hongkongers to express their views. It is also to brazenly stack the system with those loyal to the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP is “in fear of the people and of their voices”, as Alvin Yeung, leader of the opposition Civic party, says. If a fully free and fair election proceeded, it would doubtless show how little support Beijing has in the territory.
Until now, only half the 70 Legislative Council members have been directly elected. With the election postponed, the entire council, according to Ms Lam, will be decided by Beijing, a move aimed at emasculating what remains of opposition to the CCP. At last week’s AUSMIN meeting in Washington, Australia and the US expressed strong support for Hong Kong’s embattled people being able to elect representatives in a “genuinely free and fair election”. Once more, however, Beijing displays contempt for its commitments and for international law. Its conduct towards Hong Kong has added to the tensions its aggression is causing in the Asia-Pacific region.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
New law tramples Hong Kong	The Australian	Beijing is seizing control and legal authority over Territory It is no surprise that Joshua Wong, the leading Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, has described the draconian new security legislation Beijing is imposing on the territory as “an evil law”. Or that having read its details for the first time on Saturday, the local Legislative Council member, Fernando Cheung, concluded the law will conclusively demolish the special status and freedom that Hong Kong was solemnly promised in 1997 for the next 50 years. It will, he said, “immediately turn Hong Kong into (just another) mainland city”. The law could be imposed by the end of the month.
That dismal assessment is accurate. In a document that reflects all the finesse of an oppressive colonial power hellbent on imposing its will, regardless of the cost, Beijing has spelled out a new, authoritarian system that will betray the “one country, two systems” undertaking. President Xi Jinping’s Chinese Communist Party will assume the legal power to override any and all laws that have until now run Hong Kong, specifically in dealing with and punishing acts of “secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces”. Hong Kong demonstrators demanding democracy could find themselves sent to the mainland for trial in courts run by CCP hacks — the issue that sparked the uprising against Beijing’s rule. A new security committee “supervised and accountable to Beijing” will be established and “overseen” by Beijing’s handmaid, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who cravenly expressed her “gratitude” to Beijing for the new regime. She will be empowered to “cherry-pick” which judges handle cases. Under contentious legislation making it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem, the new law imposes a strict loyalty oath designed to ensure China’s democratic critics will not be allowed to run for office in September’s Legislative Council elections.
In making good on its repeated warnings to put a stop to the rebellion, the CCP is defying local and world opinion. Hong Kong’s seven million people desperately want the freedom they were promised in 1997. Last week, the Group of Seven leading economies expressed “grave concern” that the new security law would breach Beijing’s international commitments. Hard times lie ahead for Hong Kong, with the US pledging to end the territory’s trading privileges and the economy facing its deepest recession on record. Having fought a noble fight for its democratic rights, Hong Kong should not be abandoned by the free world. Its fate is part of a much broader problem of confronting Chinese aggression.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Transparency stops pandemics	The Australian	Beijing would benefit from an independent global review
It’s a fair bet China will see Scott Morrison’s phone call with Donald Trump on Wednesday as evidence of an Australian-US conspiracy to defame it over the genesis and spread of the coronavirus. So will it be incensed by reports that in calls to other world leaders, including Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Bill Gates, the Prime Minister made the case for the World Health Organisation to be given the powers of an international weapons inspector mandated to enter a country without invitation to trace the source of future pandemics. Beijing will be deluding only itself, however, if it sees either Mr Morrison’s calls or Foreign Minister Marise Payne’s sensible suggestion on Sunday for an independent international review of the pandemic as an attack on China. The sooner Beijing and its Canberra embassy understand that, the better it will be for China’s claims that despite universal criticism over the coronavirus, it wants to be regarded as a responsible global citizen.
As Senator Payne wrote in our pages on Wednesday, the pandemic, which indisputably originated in Wuhan, has literally “stopped the world”. The death toll is heading towards 200,000. Trillions of dollars have been stripped from the global economy. The impacts will grow. “Governments,” Senator Payne pointed out, “owe it to their people to work with the rest of the world to find answers, learn lessons and avoid repeats of this catastrophe … COVID-19 is now a global problem. It is right that the world should seek answers and learn lessons. That disinformation has spread shows the importance of collectively pursuing transparency.” In litigating the case for a review to “consider the genesis and spread of the pandemic, evaluate the different approaches to dealing with it, explain how information has been shared, and assess the engagement of the WHO in the response”, Senator Payne avoided mentioning China by name. But it should be obvious to Beijing that a review which uncovered the truth about the pandemic would be as much in its interests as in the interests of the rest of the world as it battles the vast health and economic consequences of what began in Wuhan. As foreign editor Greg Sheridan argues, this does not constitute interference in China’s domestic affairs.Beijing’s mindless rejection of Canberra’s suggestion for a review, and the carry-on of its forlorn diplomats here, reflect the self-deception, cover-up and brazen rewriting of history that has from the start characterised the handling of the virus outbreak by the authoritarian communist regime led by Xi Jinping. China, too, needs answers. The Morrison government, acting with governments across the world, must be unrelenting in bringing the pressure needed to persuade Beijing to help in providing them. Transparency and accountability are imperative. Otherwise we may as well all, China included, prepare for a similar catastrophe in a year or two.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Muscling up on cyber security	The Australian	Beijing’s hackers are a threat to democracies the world over
New US Department of Justice legal documents underline the importance of recommendations made by the Morrison government’s expert panel on cyber security. The documents make up the formal indictment of two Chinese hackers, both former engineering students working undercover for Beijing’s notorious Ministry of State Security spy agency. Among a vast range of online criminal activities targeted at hi-tech manufacturing companies as well as Chinese dissident groups in countries across the world, they stole a vast trove of confidential documents from an Australian defence contractor last year. More recently, according to the indictment, they hacked into the computer networks of an Australian solar company. They also recently “probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks” of American companies developing COVID-19 vaccines.
As an endorsement of the cyber-security challenges outlined by the panel led by Telstra chief executive Andy Penn and including Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm and former Trump administration Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the indictment could not be more timely. With China waging industrial-scale mass cyber attacks against Australian interests, governments and industry must work together to meet the threat Australians face online. As the panel said, there is a need for tougher legislative powers to enable security agencies to support the private sector against cyber attacks. As well, government should impose “clear consequences” against state-based actors and criminal outfits maliciously targeting Australians. Technology, as Mr Penn said, lies at the heart of most Australians’ daily lives. It “increasingly shapes our economy, our society and our future”. Yet we are exposed to increasing levels of malicious cyber activity, both state-based and criminal.
Scott Morrison’s pledge last month of “significant investment” to beef up our cyber defences will go a long way to achieving that. The $1.35bn package for cyber security and intelligence warfare includes an army of 500 newly trained specialists tasked with protecting the country from attack and hunting down spies. The panel called for increased investment in not-for-profits that support everyday Australian victims of cyber crime, as well as enhanced messaging on online safety from the government. They also call for more assistance to businesses and consumers for cyber-security toolkits. The threat democracies across the world face is not just from China. As US Assistant Attorney-General John Demers said in disclosing the case filed against the two Chinese students, “China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea in the shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals.” After being accused of cyber attacks aimed at disrupting the 2016 US election, Moscow was charged on Tuesday by the British parliament’s intelligence committee with interfering in last December’s Brexit election. Moscow also has been accused of trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine secrets. Mr Morrison has been understandably circumspect about naming China. But there is no doubt Beijing’s cyber dirty tricks have Australia firmly in their sights. The communist dictatorship, as FBI director Christopher Wray said, is embarked on a “whole-of-state effort to become the world’s only superpower by any means necessary”. Doing whatever is needed to thwart the authoritarian state’s malevolent cyber attacks on Australia could not be more vital.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
China’s brutal assault on rights	The Australian	Beijing’s new security law in Hong Kong is an ominous sign The Orwellian culling of “pro-democracy” books from Hong Kong’s libraries and stores leaves no doubt about the extent of the repression that Beijing is imposing on the territory. Together with a simultaneous order that all schoolchildren, including even those in nursery schools and special institutions, be educated in, and instructed to obey faithfully, China’s draconian new security law, it is a grim reminder of the true nature of President Xi Jinping’s Chinese Communist Party dictatorship and what it intends for Hong Kong. Not that Beijing’s assault on its cherished freedoms and rights tells us anything we didn’t know about the regime: tragically, the precedents are there in plain sight in its ruthless suppression of Tibet, its constantly bullying approach towards neighbours, and the mass imprisonment and forced sterilisation of the minority Uighurs.
Even so, it is hard to believe high-achieving Hongkongers who, as Rowan Callick wrote on Monday, “created the world’s most beautiful and vivacious modern city” and are widely regarded as among the most talented and innovative people, are now being targeted with similar senseless forms of oppression. Young pro-democracy leader Joshua Wong, whose books are among those of several authors removed from the shelves, has compared the Chinese crackdown to the ruthless “White Terror” used against political dissidents in 1920s mainland China during the rise of the Communist Party. Certainly the speed with which Beijing has moved against the books of those it regards as dangerous dissidents underlines the surly anger it has long harboured about the robust protections of free speech Hong Kong has enjoyed since the 1997 handover by Britain. The 2016 “disappearance” of booksellers who sold titles in Hong Kong critical of China’s leaders, and their unsurprising reappearance in Beijing, was a clear pointer to its intention to impose tough social controls on the city.
It is wasting no time in doing so. As Callick pointed out, so determined is Beijing to impose all 66 articles of its new security law that “not a word of it can be touched in Hong Kong itself … it can only be ‘interpreted’ by the Beijing-based National People’s Congress, which through the 71 years of the PRC has done almost invariably what the party’s general secretary tells it to do”. That is Mr Xi who, Callick wrote, in his zeal for China’s “rejuvenation” was offended that such a “privileged” corner of his empire, Hong Kong, should harbour such disloyalty. “This emperor will now never be far away,” Callick added. “He will be in the face of everyone in Hong Kong, he will be in every smartphone, he will be hovering beside every dai pai dong food stall — and his agents will be ubiquitous on and offline.” The ominous Big Brother culling of books and the order to instruct school students to obey the new security law make it clear the solemn pledge Beijing made in 1997 to respect Hong Kong’s traditions of freedom of speech and the rule of law is now well and truly over. For Western democracies and, indeed, most countries, whether or not they are shackled supplicants of Beijing’s corrupting Belt and Road Initiative, what is being done to Hong Kong should provide a reality check for their relationship with China. There is much at stake in how the world stands up to Beijing’s latest assault on democracy and its bullying attempts to emasculate the people of one of the world’s most vibrant cities.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Biden’s envoys confront China	The Australian	Beijing’s trade bullying of Australia warrants multilateral pushback
Joe Biden is unlikely to be alone in expressing “pride” for the way US foreign policy officials stood up to the crass attempts at bullying by China’s top wolf-warrior diplomats during Friday’s rancorous first summit in Anchorage’s Hotel Captain Cook.
Importantly, in sticking to their guns and rebuking Beijing for its “economic coercion towards our allies”, US Secretary of State Tony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan showed that Australia is far from alone in confronting the communist regime’s malicious attempts to cripple our trade. As Trade Minister Dan Tehan said: “All Australians should be reassured by the fact the Americans have come out and said they’ve got our back, and they won’t leave us alone on the playing field.” Not just Australia but all US allies, especially those in the Indo-Pacific region that are in Beijing’s aggressive sights, should feel similarly reassured. Mr Blinken and Mr Sullivan gave as good as they got from China’s two top foreign policy officials, Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The meeting was intended to facilitate the first major exchange of views on foreign policy since Mr Biden took office. The two US envoys revealed a determination to confront Chinese bad behaviour that critics may not have expected from the Biden administration. Their strong stand showed just how silly the likes of the ambitious Donald Trump Jr were when, as Mr Biden was being inaugurated in January, he tweeted: “Congratulations China!” In Anchorage, Mr Blinken and Mr Sullivan gave effect to Mr Biden’s assurance to Scott Morrison during this month’s summit of the Quad nations (the US, Australia, Japan and India) that China can expect to see no substantial improvement in relations with the US as long as it pursues a course of aggression against US allies.
The American envoys’ answer to a hectoring 16-minute tirade from Mr Yang was to strongly reassert US condemnation of China on a wide range of issues. They included not just Beijing’s attempts to coerce US allies such as Australia but also the “genocide” of China’s Uighurs, the suppression of Hong Kong democracy in defiance of international law, threats to overrun Taiwan, the state of human rights in China and Chinese cyber attacks.
Mr Yang targeted human rights and racism in America, referencing Black Lives Matter protests, and condemned the US for what he claimed was its undermining of global stability by using force. The US, Mr Yang insisted, no longer has an overwhelming reservoir of global influence, nor the power to use it against China.
The acrimony between the two sides left little doubt about the extent of their differences. On Saturday, the editor-in-chief of communist mouthpiece The Global Times, Hu Xijin, showed contempt for the US warning about Beijing’s treatment of US allies. “The Chinese delegation has shown the few US allies how China is dealing with the US. China has publicly refuted the US, and for those US lackeys who try to bite China, please behave. Don’t expect China to be polite to them if they always provoke China,” he wrote. President Xi Jinping would be unwise to overlook the policy markers laid down by the Biden administration at Anchorage and what they mean for the future of Washington’s relationship with Beijing. Mr Biden’s declared aim to build a multilateral coalition of the world’s democracies to confront China’s bad behaviour is a strategy that has potentially far-reaching consequences for Beijing. But its success depends on Washington achieving the confidence of allies in its willingness to stand up to China and defend them against its bullying. As Greg Sheridan wrote on Saturday, there has so far been “no significant international pushback” against the Chinese trade attacks on Australia. The commendable firmness and determination shown by the Biden administration in Anchorage must change that. The concerns raised at the summit must be pursued relentlessly.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Australia a safe haven for foreign students in a crisis	The Australian	Belligerent China is punishing its people and defaming ours
Right on cue, Beijing has inadvertently provided a boost to Australia’s higher education system. Late on Tuesday, the Ministry of Education advised Chinese students to be cautious in either coming to study in Australia or returning to study. “The spread of the new global pneumonia outbreak has not been effectively controlled, and there are risks in international travel and open campuses,” the statement said. “During the epidemic, there were multiple discriminatory incidents against Asians in Australia. The Ministry of Education reminds all overseas students to do a risk assessment and is currently cautious in choosing to study in Australia or return to Australia.” Beijing authorities put out a similar warning a few days earlier to potential tourists — not that restrictions on overseas visitors are going to be lifted by Canberra any time soon.
Let’s run through the risks. Together with Israel, Taiwan, New Zealand and a few others, Australia is in the top tier of nations in curbing the coronavirus. Daily numbers of new infections are routinely zero in several jurisdictions; community transmission is negligible. The overwhelming proportion of new COVID-19 cases are people returning from overseas, and they are required to be in 14-day quarantine. So a huge tick for us, in flattening the curve, putting in place extensive testing, tracing and extra intensive care unit capacity. Universities are working on protocols to make campuses fully operational. We are in a staged reopening of a COVID-safe economy by next month, notwithstanding the ultra-cautiousness of some premiers and weekend protests by tens of thousands on our streets under the Black Lives Matter banner.
What about safety? Tick: 95 per cent of foreign students say they choose to study in Australia because it is a safe country. Our social and economic success is based on tolerance and respect for all cultures; Australia has welcomed migrants from all over the world for generations; at the last census, 1.2 million residents identified as having Chinese ancestry. There are already 170,000 Chinese students in a country even opposition politicians say is one of the safest countries for international students to be based in right now. The “multiple discriminatory incidents”, if any, are most likely fanned by Beijing’s diplomats, who urged Chinese people to boycott our wine and beef, and to not send their children for education in a “not so friendly, even hostile” country. The warrior envoys who cried wolf!
As we saw with the 80 per cent tariff imposed on Australian barley and bans on beef producers, the penalty falls not only on our farmers, but on Chinese industry and consumers. For instance, at a stroke, Chinese brewers are less competitive due to higher ingredient costs or by being forced to use inferior alternatives. It’s lose-lose, because China has chosen coercion rather than maturely dealing with conflict, which is inevitable in global affairs. These are wanton acts of self-harm, eroding the mutuality and trust that should be the basis for a “comprehensive strategic partnership”, whatever that is in these deep-freeze days of estrangement. Chinese students choose Australia for a life-changing experience, but the ultimate prizes are a new way of critical thinking, experience of working in teams, friendships and networks, and a credential that will improve their global career prospects and life chances.
International rankings can be fickle and misleading, and a sucker’s game for revenue-obsessed vice-chancellors. Nevertheless, our elite universities are holding their places in the published pecking order. Positive word of mouth in China, feedback of graduates and current students, will carry more weight than Beijing’s puffed-up mandarins about safety and quality in education. University administrators, already under enormous financial strain due to border closures and local disruption, are looking to governments to solve the problem. Yet the pandemic and trade spats should be a wake-up call for institutions to diversify their target markets and rely less on overseas fee income; they’d been warned for years of the dangers in this model. As well, they must trim excesses in administrative staffing, focus on core competencies, cut back on trophy buildings, and raise teaching and research standards. Business as usual is over for higher education. A new path could lead to university specialisation, rather than “full service”, and research primacy in areas where we lead the world, such as geoscience and medicine. Adjusting won’t be pretty, but neither is the strategic dance with a wounded dragon. Australia is being singled out for leading the push for a global inquiry into COVID-19, our stance on Hong Kong and more robust screening of foreign investment. Perhaps this is only the tip of the iceberg of retribution. Yet conflict is unavoidable, because our sovereignty, alliances, values and liberal social order are antithetical to China’s authoritarian state. Nor can we stop a grasping, belligerent regime from punishing its people or defaming ours.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Premier’s authority going to pot	The Australian	Berejiklian is losing her way with ill-considered policy, then backflips
Serious rifts are now emerging with the NSW government and they have the potential to ultimately end the premiership of Gladys Berejiklian. It has required an almost conscious act of political self-harm to bring about this state of affairs. Regardless of their failures, other state leaders have actually tightened their grip on power, yet the NSW Premier appears to be edging toward a precarious position. Her ignominious backflip over the proposal, floated by her Attorney-General, Mark Speakman, to decriminalise illicit drugs alienated her allies and emboldened her foes. Her repeated failures of judgment on issues of symbolic importance to conservative members of her own party and their Coalition partners have squandered precious political capital. All have been spectacular own goals.
The Premier now has little residual margin for error. For that she is entirely to blame. Her maladroit handling of the fraught issue of abortion last year saw more than half of her own lower house MPs repudiate her decriminalisation legislation. Then in September this year the Coalition nearly split over changes to planning policy, ostensibly to protect koala habitats. Each time the Premier’s initial impulse was to implement a policy likelier to appeal to Greens voters than to rusted-on Coalition voters. So her latest doomed foray into an area of social policy unfortunately shouldn’t come as a surprise. However, it adds to growing disquiet inside Coalition ranks, even among some who would have been considered her supporters until recently.
The speed and vehemence of the response to the proposed decriminalisation of illegal drugs must have seriously shaken the Premier. Even Ms Berejiklian’s supporters are asking: “Why now?” For most Australians the only drug issue of any significance is the availability of a vaccine against COVID-19 to allow them to return to some semblance of normality in their lives. Australians are a pragmatic bunch in the main. They felt empathy for Ms Berejiklian when her intimate affair with disgraced former MP Daryl Maguire was exposed during inquisitorial proceedings before the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption. The episode exposed serious errors of judgment. Sadly, these have become a defining characteristic of her term. While most people dismissed the Maguire affair as a lonely, hardworking woman being unlucky in love, Ms Berejiklian should have disclosed her close connection to the former member for Wagga Wagga. The affair has come to symbolise a lack of discernment on other matters of totemic importance.
The murmurs that started after her affair with Mr Maguire was exposed are reaching a crescendo among her colleagues. Each misstep in isolation was harmful but not lethal. Cumulatively, they probably have damaged her irreparably. It is no exaggeration to suggest that her grasp on the leadership of her government is tenuous and may be in the hands of the ICAC. Any hint of any adverse references from that body may well trigger a leadership change. A challenger would likely be one of the conservative members of her cabinet who are watching the leftward drift of this government with mounting alarm. Compounding the Premier’s woes with her colleagues is the performance of her Energy Minister, Matt Kean. His apparent obsession with outflanking the Greens on renewable energy is alienating influential conservatives in Macquarie Street and Canberra. A moderate faction gameplayer, who harbours his own leadership ambitions, he is on a frolic and the Premier, who needs his support in the partyroom, is unable and unwilling to control him. Other ministers appear to be freestyling all over the place. It really should never have come to this for the likeable Ms Berejiklian. She is industrious and conscientious. She has handled fires and plague with assurance and competence while neither crippling her state nor trampling over basic liberties. But her political judgment has been shown to be flawed on too many occasions. The people elect politicians, not managers. And political acumen and sound instincts are indispensable to success in politics. But obviously success also depends on survival.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Solutions needed to GP shortage	The Australian	Better incentives must be found to draw more doctors to the country Australians living in rural and regional areas deserve far better. So do the hardworking doctors, mainly general practitioners, who struggle to meet their communities’ needs. As Kieran Gair and Stephen Lunn reported exclusively on Saturday’s front page, the nation faces a critical shortage of rural doctors, despite billions of dollars in taxpayer funds being spent on the problem for at least 15 years. The shortage partly explains why incidences of coronary heart disease, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung disease with breathing problems and poor airflow), lung cancer, stroke, suicide, arthritis and asthma all increase with remoteness from cities.
The problem is two-pronged. First, increasing numbers of medical graduates are shunning the option to train as GPs, preferring medical specialties. These are more lucrative and carry more prestige among their peers. And second, despite government investing about $1.2bn a year on initiatives aimed at getting a better distribution of doctors, the current approach is missing the mark in terms of rural recruitment. As Rural Doctors Association of Australia chief executive Peta Rutherford said, general practice was struggling to overcome a ­“declining applicant pool”. According to Deloitte Access Economics, the nation is facing a shortfall of nearly 9300 full-time GPs by 2030, representing about a quarter of the workforce, with shortages most acute in the Northern Territory. Overseas-trained doctors have taken up much of the slack, accounting for half the GP workforce in rural Australia. The recruitment of overseas doctors will resume post-COVID. But it should not be the only solution to the crisis.
It would be foolish to pretend there are easy or quick answers. But the failure of current approaches warrants careful review and an overhaul of such issues as student recruitment, incentives and the economics of country practice. As a spokesman for Health Minister Greg Hunt said, the government committed $550m in the 2018-19 budget and after the first two years more than 800 additional GPs and 700 additional nurses are working in regional and remote areas. Since 2013, the number of GPs in Australia has been growing at 2½ times the rate of the population. Measures such as establishing regional clinical schools, easing the way for rural applicants into medical courses and specialist training are in place, but have not been enough. Government, the medical profession and medical schools need to go back to the drawing board. The issue of GPs’ incomes, including the standard $38. 75 Medicare rebate per consultation, cannot be ignored. While bulk billing is popular among patients, it has created an expectation among many people that medical services can and should be free. That is not realistic. Just like in the city, more country doctors may need to charge a fee to keep their practices afloat. GPs’ limited incomes, the overheads faced by medical practices urban and rural, plus the lack of backup for holidays and days off in country areas provide little encouragement for medical graduates to leave cities and larger towns, after years of training. That is especially the case for those in their early 30s who are ready to establish their families, or when country doctors’ children are ready for secondary school and face the prospect of boarding. Rural practice often provides extremely rewarding work. The story of Deniliquin GP-obstetrician Rachel James, reported on Saturday, demonstrates the benefits of making a difference to the lives of those in close-knit country communities.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Queries on curfew shake trust in Covid-19 roadmap	The Australian	Better public policy would help Victoria’s ailing economy In addition to the state of emergency and state of disaster imposed on them, Victorians now find themselves in a state of confusion. The public health debacle that is ruining lives and destroying jobs and businesses has sunk into deep disarray, with nobody in authority able to say how or why Melbourne’s tedious 8pm-5am curfew came about. On Tuesday, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said it was not imposed as a result of his health advice. On Wednesday, Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said that the decision had not come from police. He was not consulted and only found out about it a few hours before it was announced on August 2. Premier Daniel Andrews further muddied the water, stating decisions were made “by a group of people”. But he did not pinpoint anyone or say when the decision was made. When journalists pressed the point, he tried to clarify the issue, in a way. “These are decisions ultimately made by me, so the answer to the question (of why there is a curfew) is, I’ve made that decision. It’s a challenging one to make, but it’s effective,” Mr Andrews said. Not for businesses that normally would be open after 8pm. Nor for those whose best opportunity to step outside or to top up the grocery cupboard is at night. The more fundamental issue — the civil right of citizens to move around their own city or even their own street — appears to have been put on the government backburner.
Aside from adding to the anxiety, depression and frustration of Melburnians, the curfew is compounding Victoria’s economic crisis and its impact on the rest of the nation. Our second-largest state is too big to fail; yet the extent of its failure is emerging in new analyses of the economic impact of six weeks of one of the most severe lockdowns in the world, which has been extended for a fortnight. Modelling commissioned by Melbourne City Council from PricewaterhouseCoopers suggests coronavirus will deliver a $23bn hit to Melbourne’s CBD and inner suburbs this year, wiping out 22,000 jobs and causing the city’s economy to contract by almost a quarter. In the next five years the capital could lose up to $110bn and 79,000 jobs compared with pre-pandemic projections.
Beyond Melbourne, analysis by KPMG shows the Victorian economy will shrink by up to 20 per cent on pre-pandemic levels because of the extended restrictions and business shutdowns. The hit to the state economy could be as much as $6bn. In a worst-case scenario, KPMG warns, an extra 350,000 workers could join the jobless queue in the three months to September. That would be on top of roughly 250,000 jobs already lost as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
As Melbourne wallows in despair, it is understandable that Melbourne Lord Mayor Sally Capp is calling for billions of dollars in investment from commonwealth and state governments to support businesses and deliver infrastructure stimulus. Taxpayers, however, are not a bottomless money pit. And the Andrews government’s approach to public policy is not engendering confidence among investors. As Australian Retailers Association chief executive Paul Zahra says, restrictions have hit the city’s CBD like a sledgehammer. While Melbourne’s CBD had a million visitors a day last year, foot traffic has fallen by almost 90 per cent. Mr Andrews is preparing to unveil a major economic rescue package, which accords with the advice of the Reserve Bank that the states need to do more of the economic lifting. But he also needs to put public health policy in better order. Victorian government MPs are understandably concerned about the virtual disappearance of Health Minister Jenny Mikakos, with one colleague claiming she had “gone into hiding”. Ms Mikakos was regularly by Mr Andrews’s side earlier in the pandemic, but this has diminished in the wake of the hotel quarantine fiasco and contact tracing problems. These are at the heart of the state’s second wave of COVID-19 and its heavy-handed and costly response. If ever the state needed strong leadership in the health portfolio it is now. On Thursday the inquiry into the hotel quarantine fiasco heard Brendan Murphy, chief medical officer at the time, offered Australian Defence Force personnel to use in the program. Why was that offer not accepted? Even former federal opposition leader Bill Shorten wants Victoria’s lockdown restrictions to “come off a bit quicker”. And federal Victorian Labor MP Daniel Mulino, a former Andrews government MP from the party’s Right, is correct in urging the Premier to release the full modelling underpinning his roadmap to recovery. More detailed information, Mr Mulino said, would improve community confidence in the plan. It could hardly erode it any further. After confusion over who called for the Melbourne curfew and why, and the daily sacrifices being forced on them, Victorians deserve to be taken into the government’s confidence.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Building a highway to recovery	The Australian	Better roads will serve country Queenslanders and business
Promising to build roads is a political favourite at any election and the Queensland Liberal National Party has wasted no time with its bid to outflank the state Labor government on the issue. The starting gun has yet to be fired on the campaign proper for the October 31 state poll but LNP leader Deb Frecklington has pledged a 15-year, $33bn upgrade of the Bruce Highway linking Brisbane and Cairns that will be 80 per cent funded by the federal government. Premier Annastacia Palas­zczuk has cried foul, saying her government already has a deal with Canberra to spend $12.6bn on improving the highway across the next 15 years.
Politics aside, Ms Frecklington has a good cause. It is a longstanding disgrace that Australia’s most decentralised state remains unserviced by a decent intrastate motorway. The success of former LNP premier Campbell Newman in pushing through road tunnel infrastructure to arrest traffic congestion in Brisbane has amplified a city-versus-regions divide for the nearly 55 per cent of Queenslanders who live outside the state capital. Flood-prone and mostly two lanes, the Bruce Highway is dangerous for users and a handbrake on state development. A Bruce Highway upgrade scheme began on July 1, 2013, when Mr Newman was premier, with a rolling program of projects to be completed by June 2028. Before the 2017 election, the Queensland ALP committed to a Bruce Highway Trust to identify and prioritise projects to be delivered through a series of five-year action plans.
For the coming election, the LNP has pledged to turn the entire 1650km of highway between Brisbane and Cairns into a four-lane dual carriageway. Road spending will be popular in the regions and no doubt has been promised by the LNP with electoral advantage in mind.
As Jamie Walker has outlined, the road cuts through or borders 14 marginal electorates in provincial Queensland, eight of them held by Labor and two more by minor parties that will be targeted by the LNP. The remaining four LNP seats under 5 per cent are on the ALP’s priority list to deliver Ms Palaszczuk a third term. The “highway marginals” in play include Labor-held Townsville with a knife-edge margin of 0.38 per cent, the LNP seat of Burdekin based on the sugar town of Ayr (0.8 per cent), Mackay-based Whitsunday held by expelled LNP MP turned independent Jason Costigan (0.68 per cent), One Nation’s seat of Mirani north of Rockhampton (4.82 per cent) and Labor-held Maryborough (2.46 per cent).
Regardless of politics, the project has merit. A blueprint for the upgrade can be found in the quarter-century project to improve the Pacific Highway between Sydney and Brisbane. The Pacific Highway upgrade was started in 1996 amid outcries over public safety. It is now 90 per cent complete and has achieved a 70 per cent reduction in fatal crashes and cut travel times between the two capitals by 2½ hours. As recently as 1958 sections of the Pacific Highway were still dirt. Infrastructure is the business of government and completing a world-class highway the length of the east coast from Melbourne to Cairns should be high on the list of priorities. With interest rates low and the need high for nation-building projects to boost employment, a Queensland road plan should have wide support.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Facebook’s tactics backfire as it unfriends the nation	The Australian	Big tech’s monopoly practices have been exposed yet again As far as negotiating tactics go, this one is a real doozy. Despite entering into extensive talks with media companies to pay for the content it uses to attract an audience of Australian users in the millions, Facebook, the social media giant founded 17 years ago, decided to take the nuclear option and ban not only news content from mainstream providers, including the ABC and The Australian, but a raft of sites that rely on quality news outlets to convey invaluable information to readers — from bushfire mitigation, to domestic violence advice and even pages run by suburban mothers.
In one clumsy strike, Facebook completely alienated its users all over Australia — and infuriated everyone from the Prime Minister to the Australian Greens. In doing so, it reinforced exactly why the tech giant requires government scrutiny and regulation to rein in its extraordinary market power. By unilaterally blocking the sharing of all news from being accessed by its Australian users, Facebook is also promoting the insidious influence of fake news and conspiracy culture, denying news outlets, companies, civil authorities and responsible users the opportunity to correct false and outlandish claims that drive misinformation, misunderstanding and division. Facebook’s former Australian boss Stephen Scheeler said the platform’s behaviour was “an act of war”. He urged Australians to delete the app to send a message to the company.
Facebook treated the public with contempt on Thursday, even blocking access to pages vital to public safety such as police and emergency services, information on mental health assistance, domestic violence prevention, weather bureaus and health authorities’ pages giving details about the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Some of these were later restored. But it was an astonishing abdication of responsibility that exposed Facebook’s real priorities. These have nothing to do with its users.
As technology editor David Swan points out, Facebook was the platform that allowed the horror and the bloodshed of the Christchurch massacre to be live-streamed to a worldwide audience. “And yet allowing the free flow of information that is in the public interest, and for the greater good, appears to be a bridge too far.” The extent of Facebook’s shutdowns also demonstrated its unfettered power to censor and control, on very short notice, what the public can and cannot see online through its platform.
As a global monopoly, the company is using its account holders as bargaining chips as it tries to strongarm its way out of complying with the Morrison government’s media bargaining code legislation, which passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday. The legislation, which other nations are set to follow, will ensure that Facebook and Google pay local publishers a fair price for the news content they use and make money from. That is eminently reasonable. No other business, after all, can operate by grabbing the work of other professionals, using it to generate advertising revenue, but refusing to pay those who created the content. Of every $100 spent in online advertising in Australia — about $9bn a year — $53 goes to Google and $28 goes to Facebook, Josh Frydenberg told parliament in question time on Thursday. In light of those dynamics, the Treasurer said, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission recommended initially that the government put in place a mandatory code.
Rather than negotiating with publishers in good faith, Facebook is trying to brandish its monopoly power to force its own way. Google, in contrast, has concluded deals with Seven West Media, Nine Entertainment and News Corporation. News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson has announced a “historic multi-year partnership” with Google, which will make “significant payments” for displaying content across the world from publications including The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London and The Australian. The deal would have “a positive impact on journalism around the globe as we have firmly established that there should be a premium for premium journalism”, Mr Thomson said. The terms of trade were changing for every publisher. That change will benefit the public as media companies will be able to invest in quality journalism.
While running hot and cold on the process of negotiating with Australian publishers, Facebook has been more intent on reinforcing its monopoly position. In December, the US Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company, accusing it of eliminating threats to its monopoly. The lawsuit, backed by 48 US state attorneys-general, targets Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. As Scott Morrison says, Facebook’s move to “unfriend” Australia will reinforce concerns in other nations that also have had enough of its behaviour. If Facebook is to regain credibility, it will return to the negotiating table or lose its audience.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Opposition falls for China trap	The Australian	Bipartisanship, not party political pointscoring, is what is needed
Leaders seeking to make political capital out of our crisis in relations with China are not what Australia needs right now. Yet, with exquisitely poor timing, that is what Anthony Albanese, Bill Shorten and others on the ALP frontbench have done by breaking ranks with Scott Morrison in a way that plays into Beijing’s hands. Doing so inevitably will undermine the significant wave of international support for the nation’s steadfast stand against China’s belligerence and bullying.
In federal parliament on Monday, the Opposition Leader commendably pledged Labor’s backing for the Prime Minister’s condemnation of the notorious and highly damaging Chinese tweet of a fake image depicting an Australian soldier allegedly slitting the throat of an Afghan child. Mr Albanese joined in describing it as “gratuitous, inflammatory and deeply offensive”. Australia’s condemnation of the image was, he rightly declared, above politics. “We all stand as a nation in condemning it.” By Wednesday, however, Mr Albanese was singing from a different song sheet. Doubtless to the delight of Beijing’s hot-headed “wolf warrior” diplomats who place blame for the crisis entirely on Australia, Mr Albanese accused the government of presiding over “a complete breakdown” in Sino-Australian diplomacy. He was, he said, amazed that Morrison government ministers could not get their Chinese counterparts to return calls. He contrasted this with his own record as a minister able to meet Chinese officials.
“We need to work on the relationship,” Mr Albanese told 2SM radio, adding “that doesn’t mean compromising our values or preparedness to speak up for them”. He recalled a speech made by prime minister Kevin Rudd, “in Mandarin, of course”, that was critical of human rights issues, “but was done so in a way that also was designed to make clear our values but not designed to offend for offence’s sake”. (That would be the same Mr Rudd who revealed his uniquely inoffensive diplomatic skills when he was heard at a climate change summit in Copenhagen in 2009 saying “those Chinese ratf..kers are trying to ratf..k us”.) Mr Shorten supported Mr Albanese, joining in the pile-on against the Morrison government by saying it had not “handled this up to now as well as they could have”. Opposition assistant Treasury spokesman Stephen Jones also weighed in, playing further into Beijing’s hands by accusing government MPs of “inflaming tensions with China”. Such criticism can hardly be more unhelpful or ill-judged when Australia is faced with such potentially dire economic consequences as a result of Beijing’s onslaught and its clear determination to do as much damage as it can to our economy and the jobs of Australians.
Mr Albanese and his colleagues are entitled to their views. But, given what is at stake in terms of the national interest, it should not be too much to expect them to resist making criticisms that boost Beijing’s blame game and embarrass those such as the leaders of our Five Eyes partners, notably New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who have joined in strongly backing Australia’s outrage over Beijing’s antics.
Countries across the world are showing significant support for Australia. Ms Ardern has incurred the wrath of Beijing’s febrile propaganda machine by demanding answers. Members of Britain’s House of Commons, while debating measures to further curtail the activities of the Huawei telecom company, have heard new warnings about Chinese spying in the UK. The US State Department on Wednesday declared solid support for Australia over what it termed a “new low” for the CCP in “spreading disinformation and fabricating an image”. Two hundred MPs from different political parties in 19 countries issued a call for consumers everywhere to join in buying Australian wine in deliberate defiance of China. The White House joined in, announcing Australian wine would be featured at a special holiday event. As countries across the region that are threatened by Chinese bullying closely watch Australia’s standoff with Beijing, it would be hard to exaggerate the importance of our own leaders not saying or doing anything that plays into China’s hands. Anything that suggests we are divided as a nation in our response to Beijing would do just that. Bipartisanship, not party political pointscoring and ill-timed criticism, is vital if Beijing’s destructive belligerence is to be successfully confronted.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Keeping focus on roots of indigenous incarceration	The Australian	Black Lives Matter protests here conflate different issues
Tens of thousands of Australians took part in Black Lives Matter protests, mirroring rallies around the world, to express outrage and sorrow for the intolerable killing of African-American George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Yet some activists have conflated that tragedy and the long history of racially motivated police brutality in the US with the high rate of indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody here. It’s naive and wrongheaded to see US despair and injustice as playing out on our soil. For starters, the core issues are complex, with vastly different cultural and institutional factors in the two countries. Still, we need to think carefully about how to improve the way we police and when we incarcerate, and the factors that bring offenders to jail.
The Morrison government is right to seek more ambitious targets for decreasing the number of Aboriginal Australians in jail as it overhauls the Closing the Gap policy to reduce indigenous disadvantage. Since 2008 the program has tried, but not done enough, to improve the lives and life chances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. While governments have focused on health, education and employment outcomes, and spent more on programs, progress has been patchy and slow. Just two of the seven targets set 12 years ago by Kevin Rudd — early childhood education and Year 12 attainment — were achieved. Targets for school attendance, child mortality, employment, life expectancy, and literacy and numeracy have not been reached. In December 2018, the Council of Australian Governments opted for a policy refresh with new targets, including one for justice.
As we reported on Tuesday, Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt is pushing for each state and territory to adopt specific incarceration targets. An earlier draft opted for a 5 per cent fall in the detention rate among adults and an 11 to 19 per cent drop among youths by 2028. Canberra will take a higher target to the negotiations with the states next month. Mr Wyatt said if we want to reduce deaths in custody, we need to look very closely at what’s happening in Australia, “the factors contributing to incarceration rates and the way in which our systems are handling these incidents”.
Since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991, the rate at which indigenous people have died in jail as a percentage of the Aboriginal prison population has fallen; it is now below the non-indigenous prison population. An Australian Institute of Criminology study over 15 years shows 58 per cent of indigenous deaths in custody were deemed to be from “natural causes”. As Paul Maley writes on Wednesday, the justice system has “sensitised” itself to the vulnerabilities of indigenous offenders, with a range of measures to reduce risk of harm. When they hit the courts, indigenous offenders draw lower average sentences. Still, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the number of indigenous people in the prison system has increased from 19 per cent in 2000 to nearly 30 per cent in March this year. There are 12,900 indigenous people in prisons. At the last census, indigenous people made up just under 3 per cent of the population.
As we have long argued, underlying causes of indigenous offending need to be fixed. Labor’s former indigenous affairs minister, Robert Tickner, says imprisonment rates will remain high until there are substantial changes in health, education and housing. Pat Turner, the lead convener of the Coalition for Peaks, said Aboriginal leaders were pushing for more ambition across all categories in the Closing the Gap refresh, not only justice, including health, education, economic development and housing. But there also needs to be a rethink on the ground in the ways of policing and punishment, and more openness by authorities for serial failures. We have reported extensively on police brutality, such as the 2004 death of Cameron Doomadgee in a Palm Island lockup. A decade later, there was the horrific case of “Miss Dhu”, who died at a remote Pilbara watch house, and the scandal of secrecy by officials. The doggedness of Paige Taylor and Michael McKenna exposed the truth behind the 22-year-old woman’s inhumane treatment and the bizarre fine-enforcement regime in Western Australia. Legislation to reduce the practice of jailing people for unpaid fines is being debated in the WA upper house this week. Indigenous disadvantage has deep roots in our society, demanding specific yet often uncomplicated approaches. We should keep the focus on these practical ways to close the gap, aim high, try new things — and not be distracted by the theatre or urgency of ephemeral rage.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Porter’s High Court challenge	The Australian	Black-letter lawyers are needed for stability on the bench Confirmation hearings under way in the US to consider judge Amy Coney Barrett’s suitability for the Supreme Court underscore how fortunate Australia is with its system of judicial appointments. Federal Attorney-General Christian Porter has free rein to decide who should fill two High Court vacancies that will arise in coming months. Speculation is rife about who will replace sitting judges Geoffrey Nettle and Virginia Bell, who soon will reach the retirement age of 70.
Unlike in the US, the first anyone will know of the successful appointments will be when they are announced by Mr Porter. Once announced, the decision will not be open for negotiation or review. As Nicola Berkovic reports, there is great enthusiasm within legal circles to attempt to guess who the successful candidates may be. There is some debate about whether the gender balance of the court will be maintained and what the new appointments may mean for how the court will approach controversial issues in the future.
The Attorney-General has great power to exercise his discretion on judicial appointments, and with that comes a great responsibility to ensure the integrity of the nation’s highest court is preserved. One way to do this would be to seek to bolster the position of the Chief Justice, Susan Kiefel, who found herself in the minority in a 4-3 split decision in Love v Commonwealth of Australia, referred to as “the aliens case”. In that case, the High Court found that Aboriginal Australians were not subject to the alien powers in the Constitution and therefore could not be deported. Neither of the applicants in the case, both of whom were convicted criminals, was born in Australia, was an Australian citizen or had ever sought to become a citizen. Legal affairs writer Chris Merritt argued the majority decision created a race-based exception to the written text of the Constitution that had the ­effect of benefiting foreign criminals with Aboriginal ancestry. They also introduced an inconsistency into what the common law said about the relationship of Indigenous people to the land. The aliens case decision raised arguments about judicial adventurism and led to concerns the High Court could face a level of distrust that was last seen under chief justice Sir Anthony Mason in the 1980s.
Some people clearly would welcome a more activist bench and support a lessening of the Attorney-General’s powers in making appointments. There have been calls for the establishment of a judicial appointments committee made up of leading figures in the law to vet candidates and present a shortlist from which the Attorney-General can choose. This idea has been rejected by Mr Porter. Although superficially attractive, it would limit the options available to executive government. Mr Porter must be free to choose but, in doing so, must resist all temptation to stray from fidelity to the wellbeing of the law. He must make his choices free of any constraint by identity or any other politics. In The Australian’s view, the High Court and the nation would be best served by judges who are legal conservatives, as distinct from political conservatives, who will apply the law in a black-letter way. The Australian system, fortunately, relieves some of the pressure on having to navigate identity-based appointments. Many in the legal profession still adhere to the attractions of the “hero” judge prepared to move the needle on progressive causes. Former High Court justice Michael Kirby was held in high esteem by many because of his socially progressive approach. But the record shows Mr Kirby was often in the minority view. On the other side, justice Ian Callinan was regarded as a black-letter practitioner and a steady hand. Mr Porter must wear responsibility for his choices, which will help define his political fortunes. The aliens case did little to enhance the standing of former attorney-general George Brandis, who appointed two of the majority judges to the decision. Free of political distractions, Mr Porter should seek a legal conservative with strong adherence to the original intention of the Constitution and the black letter of statute. The High Court is the last refuge for justice and must be stable and held in the highest regard.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Ardern’s one-way bubble trouble	The Australian	Border restrictions are causing headaches for travellers everywhere New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, once the poster child of heavy lockdowns, is right to voice her concern about the disruption caused by a 72-hour pause in quarantine-free travel to Australia because of a single case of COVID-19 in her country. Sympathy for Ardern must be tempered, however, by the fact the trans-Tasman bubble has been one-way traffic that still prevents Australians from making an easy trip across the Tasman. New Zealanders now know how Australians feel as neighbouring states make hasty decisions that throw travel plans into chaos and can leave people stranded far from home.
This time it is the federal government adding fresh uncertainty to an arrangement that had promised restoration of free movement around the Pacific. Health Minister Greg Hunt announced the new restrictions after a woman tested positive on Saturday to a highly infectious South African variant of COVID-19. She had been in hotel quarantine in Auckland and returned a positive test a week after her release. In October last year the Australian Department of Health declared NZ as a low risk of COVID-19 transmission to Australia. Since then, NZ passengers have been free to travel to Australia, quarantine free, provided they have not been in a COVID-19 hotspot in the preceding 14 days. Australia defined a hotspot using a three-day rolling average of three locally acquired cases a day. The situation in NZ clearly did not breach the rules as they were first applied. But fear about more contagious forms of the virus has seen the rule book thrown away.
Ms Ardern contacted Scott Morrison to express her disappointment. For a trans-Tasman bubble to work, she said, people needed confidence that “we won’t see closures at the borders that happen with very short notice over incidents that can be well managed domestically”. As a result of a single positive test, NZ has become entangled in Australia’s cross-border frustrations that, until this week, the commonwealth had been keen to criticise.
Since Monday, arrivals to Australia from NZ have been required to quarantine for 14 days in government-arranged accommodation at their own expense. Despite the equally low numbers of infections in Australia, travel remains restricted across much of the continent. Queensland has a permit system in place that rejects visitors from the Greater Sydney area, including the NSW central coast and Wollongong. Victoria requires all visitors to get a permit under a traffic light system that puts the Cumberland Council area of Sydney out of bounds. Visitors to Victoria from other areas of Greater Sydney must apply for an orange zone permit, agree to a COVID-19 test within 72 hours of travel and remain in self-quarantine until receiving a negative result. Visitors to Western Australia from NSW and Queensland must self-quarantine for 14 days and present for testing on day 11. Visitors from Greater Sydney, Wollongong and the central coast are not permitted to enter South Australia unless they are an essential traveller or exempt person. Visitors to SA from Brisbane must quarantine for 14 days. Border closures are a near-impossible challenge for tourism operators and people wanting to travel. A consistent national framework is needed. NZ could be included, but it should be two-way traffic, with Australians free to cross the ditch.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
States’ game of thrones as businesses and jobs wither	The Australian	Borders need to open up before the winter school holidays Like feudal barons defending their ramparts, the premiers and chief ministers of Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory are letting tourist enterprises wither, along with the morale of those whose jobs and small businesses depend on the industry. Queensland, normally a winter mecca for visitors, has the most to lose, especially around Cairns and Port Douglas in the far north, the Great Barrier Reef islands, the Whitsundays and the Sunshine and Gold coasts. Five-and-a-half months from a state election, we wonder if Labor has polled the matter and Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has picked up the research upside down. Some of her most marginal seats are in the areas hardest hit. Regardless of her political thinking in stating the border might not reopen until September, Ms Palaszczuk should find the graphic published on Thursday informative. More than 2.2 million interstate visitors spent $3.1bn in Queensland in the September quarter last year. The chief protectors of fortresses WA, South Australia, Tasmania and the NT also should study the figures.
Ms Palaszczuk’s explanation that she is following Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young’s advice that NSW and Victoria need to record two incubation periods — up to four weeks of zero cases of community transmission of COVID-19 — for the border to reopen will not cut it. Dr Young has done a good job during the pandemic. But she is not elected to make decisions. Nor do some of her peers agree with her dogmatic assertion on Thursday that “this is not the time for tourists to travel into Queensland”. Federal Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says: “From a medical point of view, I can’t see why the borders are still closed.” That advice also applies to Dr Kelly’s home state, Western Australia, despite Premier Mark McGowan claiming not to have heard of Dr Kelly. However it plays out in the west, Mr McGowan’s churlish “bad luck” and “frankly, I don’t give a damn” rhetoric directed at Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian does him no credit. Likewise South Australian Premier Steven Marshall’s claim that border closures are “for health reasons but also for economic reasons”. As Barossa resorts brace for a deadly quiet winter, it defies logic. The concerns of Senator Birmingham and Ms Berejiklian over the wider economic impact of state border closures are justified and responsible. They deserve to prevail over narrow political perceptions. Have premiers forgotten that the colonies federated in 1901 and that the national interest affects us all? Constitutional lawyers suspect the interstate travel restrictions may even be illegal.
Preoccupied as they are with their game of thrones, the premiers are overlooking another illogical fallacy. There is no reason, as they wallow in splendid isolation, they should not fast-track their sheltered jurisdictions to step three of their recovery plans. Free from the risks posed by potentially unclean interlopers from NSW and Victoria, there is no reason to wait until July to allow up to 100 people to gather in public spaces, restaurants, cinemas and places of worship. In the absence of interstate and overseas visitors they will need to open up if local businesses are to be resuscitated. The nation’s shrinking pool of taxpayers cannot carry recipients of JobKeeper and JobSeeker indefinitely. A fortnight ago, Scott Morrison said it would be up to premiers and chief ministers to explain why a restriction was remaining in place if it was being removed elsewhere. But lockdowns are set to cost the tourism industry $10bn in six months if premiers refuse to open up before October, as Rosie Lewis writes on Friday. A firmer nudge from Canberra may be in order. Australian National University school of clinical medicine professor Peter Collignon, who specialises in infectious diseases, doubts COVID-19 will be eliminated completely. As he says: “We need to learn to live with a risk that is low but a risk that will not be zero.” Nearly 11 million Australians travelled interstate in the September quarter last year. Queensland drew the lion’s share. To survive without overseas travellers, the industry now needs that many people and more this year.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
British Labour’s Corbyn curse	The Australian	Boris Johnson sees a chance to consolidate his poll victory
With British Labour in disarray over a successor to Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson’s ambition to move the House of Lords from London to the northern city of York makes political sense. His landslide victory last month owed much to voters in Labour heartland seats in the Midlands, northeast England and Yorkshire, all strongly pro-Brexit, “breaking the voting habits of generations” to vote Conservative. With a 4 per cent swing across the region, Conservatives won 28 more seats than in 2017, a result crucial to achieving their 80-seat Commons majority. Giving a victory address in Tony Blair’s former Sedgefield seat, which returned a Tory MP for the first time in 84 years, Mr Johnson promised to repay northern support.
With the Palace of Westminster falling down and due for extensive refurbishment over several years, Mr Johnson sees an opportunity to consolidate gains and appeal to regional sentiment by relocating the Lords, a move with major symbolic and economic significance. He should be forgiven for seeking to make life even more difficult for Labour as it struggles to recover from its worst electoral performance since 1935. What was expected to be a sensible, root-and-branch, post-election process of ridding the party of Mr Corbyn and the failed, lunar left and shamefully anti-Semitic policies rejected by the electorate is turning out to be vastly different. Mr Corbyn set the tone with a bizarre claim that though Labour lost, it won the argument, whatever that was.None of the four women and one man seeking the succession has done much to challenge him. Even the leading “moderate”, the unlikely titled (for a Labour leader) Sir Keir Starmer, has been pandering to Mr Corbyn’s far-left base and its manifesto of pie-in-the-sky election promises. As The Times noted, “his campaign has consisted of articles of unpublishable emptiness whose only hints of content are signals to the left that he is a fellow traveller”. Another frontrunner, Rebecca Long Bailey, Mr Corbyn’s preferred “continuity” candidate, has been described as a “charisma-free Corbyn clone”. Labour’s path back to power, she said, “lies in taking on the political establishment with a commitment to democratising and decarbonising our economy”. Labour has yet to learn that it will remain unelectable until it rids itself of Mr Corbyn and his vacuous legacy. No wonder Mr Blair, arguably modern Labour’s most successful leader, wrote “the party is presently marooned on Fantasy Island”.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Bitter lessons of impeachment	The Australian	Both Republicans and Democrats have damaged America
Donald Trump’s displays of self-congratulation after his acquittal by the US Senate are understandable. But it will be a pity if he and the Democrats fail to learn the lessons of what was ultimately a pointless and highly divisive impeachment process that to some recalls the deep splits in American society during the Vietnam War. The US President has good reason to claim “exoneration” after what he regarded as a “sham impeachment process” that the Democrats were looking for an excuse to launch from the day he entered the White House in 2017. That the Senate cleared him of the abuse of power charge with only one Republican, Mitt Romney, crossing the floor reflects Mr Trump’s success in defending himself. So does his 53 to 47 victory in defeating the obstruction of congress charge, rejected even by Senator Romney. There was never any prospect the Democrats would get the 67-vote, two-thirds majority needed to remove Mr Trump from office.
But in victory Mr Trump would be wise to look beyond those bare numbers. They obscure the reality that although they voted against conviction, some of the Republican Party’s most experienced and highly regarded senators expressed deep concern about Mr Trump’s controversial call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Senator Lamar Alexander described Mr Trump’s actions as “inappropriate”, saying the charges against him were proved but were not impeachable offences. Mr Romney, scion of a Republican family, sided with the Democrats: “There’s not much I can think of that would be a more egregious assault on our constitution than trying to corrupt an election to maintain power.” If he is to avoid controversy, Mr Trump should listen to dissenting “friendly fire” voices in his party and beyond. The Wall Street Journal, usually sympathetic to the US President, condemned his call to Kiev as “reckless and dumb”.
Democrats, too, have much to learn from the abysmal failure of what was an ill-conceived, poorly managed process. It never had a snowball’s hope in hell of coming close to meeting the “high crimes and misdemeanours” standard required by the US constitution for impeachment. The Democrats have done immense damage to their chances in November. And they have set a dangerous precedent by ensuring the next Democratic president will be targeted for impeachment on even the most specious grounds from the day he or she enters the White House.The greatest damage, however, may have been done to the US by what was a highly partisan, reckless episode. In his first post-acquittal tweet Mr Trump sent a mocked-up cover of Time magazine showing himself being re-elected every four years for the rest of the century, headlined “TRUMP 4EVA”. Polls indicate he’s on a roll. But America has no more need of such triumphalism now than it does of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s petulant tantrum in tearing up his State of the Union address. America deserves better from both sides.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Reckoning time for ADF elite forces in Afghanistan	The Australian	Both cultural and leadership issues need to be addressed If members of Australia’s elite special forces have committed war crimes or atrocities in Afghanistan during our longest war, they deserve to face the full weight of the criminal justice system. The Brereton inquiry has dragged on far too long, since May 2016. As it has meandered towards its grim culmination, many reputations have been tarnished and the cohesion of our most capable military units has been ruptured by claims and counterclaims about serious criminal misconduct.
Justice delayed is justice denied. Some soldiers have faced trial by smear and innuendo. This must be resolved without further delay, in the interests of both justice and national security. Where appropriate, charges should be brought and trials ensue. There is no place in the armed forces of liberal democracies for war criminals.
Soldiers in such armies occupy a unique and invidious position. They are authorised to employ lethal force against their nation’s enemies. That is an onerous responsibility. They enter a contract of unlimited liability with the state. They forsake many liberties that their compatriots take for granted, while accepting that they may be required to die in the service of governments for which they did not vote, in wars they did not choose.
This sets them apart from the narcissistic, entitled culture that they are willing to pay the ultimate price to defend. Few would envy their responsibility. The murder of three Diggers by turncoat Afghan soldier Hekmatullah showed a snippet of the environment they faced.
Correspondingly, such responsibility demands that they embody the highest values of our nation. The soldier of a democracy is neither a mercenary nor a contract killer. National values and international law demand that our troops employ force with discretion and proportionality. Wantonly killing unarmed civilians or prisoners of war is illegal and immoral. It is now clear that the Morrison government expects the Brereton inquiry to reveal unacceptable conduct by some of our special forces in Afghanistan. Granted, in war there is no substitute for victory. But in defending our values we require that our troops not emulate those of our enemies. If any comfort is to be drawn from this tawdry saga, it is that men of considerable moral fibre have drawn a clear, bright line in the sand and provided evidence of atrocities to the Brereton inquiry. They have broken ranks from their band of brothers to heed the demands of their consciences.
Nor should we forget that the inquiry was instigated by a commander of special forces, Major General Jeff Sengelman. Doing so demanded moral courage and commendable integrity. It also was General Sengelman who commissioned a review in early 2016 by Canberra sociologist Samantha Crompvoets into the culture of special forces command that in turn prompted the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force investigation led by judge Paul Brereton. In 2018, leaked elements of Dr Crompvoets’s report alluded to a culture of impunity about the use of force, illicit drug use, and poisonous rivalries between the Special Air Service and Commando regiments.
Now, after interminable investigations and inquiries, the Chief of the Defence Force has belatedly appointed esteemed former naval officer and Anglican bishop Tom Frame to conduct yet another review into the culture of the special forces. This purportedly will go further than that of Dr Crompvoets in also examining the conduct of the senior ADF leadership and the strategic conduct of the war. Bishop Frame is a man of intellect and integrity. If there must be another inquiry, he is eminently qualified to lead it.
But what will this new inquiry achieve other than further disruption of our most capable land forces when our strategic environment has deteriorated rapidly? Now is the time for those who have allegedly committed crimes to face justice. It is also time for our political and military leaders to face their collective policy failures in the conduct of the Afghan war. Both the CDF and the current Chief of Army served in the Special Air Service Regiment. Both held key command appointments at crucial times during the conflict. Root-and-branch reform of their old unit is their job. They need to get on with it and not kick the can down the road until 2022 when they will have retired or will be approaching the end of their careers. To suggest Bishop Frame can seriously examine the absence of a coherent strategy for the war in Afghanistan is disingenuous. Too much was demanded of the special forces through multiple deployments because of government aversion to casualties among our conventional forces. As Ben Packham has reported, the mental toll of multiple deployments led to indifference to human life and contemptuous disregard for the laws of armed conflict. Responsibility for that parlous state of affairs lies with political and senior ADF leaders who had no clear strategic goals for our commitment other than to be seen as a reliable US ally.
Some of the leadership problems have been acknowledged by former defence ministers Brendan Nelson and Joel Fitzgibbon. The SAS, whose role traditionally had been stealthy insertion, surveillance and extraction, was used as a blunt instrument conducting strike missions against Taliban leadership targets. Bishop Frame will not have the power to call those responsible to account. Now is the time for reckoning, not research.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
India relationship strengthened	The Australian	Both nations share significant regional security concerns
Scott Morrison’s summit by video link with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday laid the foundations for a closer strategic relationship with New Delhi that will be potentially important for the Indo-Pacific region. There were no specific agenda items concerning China’s increasing aggression, but Beijing was the proverbial elephant in the room as the leaders reached agreement under a new Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The pact highlighted the 21st century strategic convergence between Australia and the world’s most populous democracy.
Accords that commit Mr Morrison and Mr Modi to work closely, as the leaders of democratic nations, to ensure the freedom and security of Indo-Pacific shipping lanes are vital at a challenging time in the region. Both nations will allow reciprocal access to each other’s military facilities, including “seamless co-operation across the high seas”. Major new defence, science and technology arrangements designed to “preserve an open, free, safe and secure internet” against disruption were also agreed, as were strategies for securing minerals and medical supply chains.
As Mr Morrison and Mr Modi talked, influential Indian newspaper The Hindu reported that Australia will soon be asked to rejoin the Malabar trilateral naval exercises, bringing together India, the US and Japan. The exercises are regarded as the pinnacle of naval co-operation in the Indo-Pacific and are watched closely by Beijing. Bowing to pressure from China after Australia was invited to take part in the exercises, Kevin Rudd withdrew in February 2008. Attempts by Canberra since then to rejoin the group have been resisted by India.
Indications that New Delhi is keen to see Australia back in the Malabar exercises suggests the Morrison-Modi summit has lifted the bilateral relationship to a new level. This is no surprise at a time when India’s fractious relationship with Beijing is under major new strain, with Chinese troops massed along its 3488km mutual border.
During the summit, Mr Morrison told Mr Modi that it’s time “for our relationship to go broader and deeper … with friends we trust … (and with which) we share a vision for open, free, rules-based multilateral systems in our region”. Mr Modi responded by saying that, as democracies, both India and Australia had a “sacred responsibility” to uphold and protect “the rule of law, freedom, mutual respect, respect for international institutions and transparency”. Those messages should resonate with other regional democracies such as Singapore and South Korea, which could also be brought into an expanded Malabar naval defence arrangement. Despite the success of the summit, important challenges remain. Nine years after a trade agreement was first mooted, Mr Morrison and Mr Modi have agreed to resume stalled negotiations. Mr Modi needs to do more, however, to help expedite a deal.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Queensland should snatch reform from jaws of chaos	The Australian	Both sides of politics must show their economic credentials
The political instability around Jackie Trad’s resignation as Deputy Premier and Treasurer could be a cloud with a silver lining for Queenslanders. If Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and incoming Treasurer Cameron Dick have the vision and drive to seize the initiative, Ms Trad’s resignation, less than five months from the October 31 election, is an opportunity to overhaul Labor’s union-dominated economic approach as the state emerges from the fallout of COVID-19.
Policy settings that encourage business investment, job creation and productivity rather than more government spending and regulation will be the keys to recovery. For Queenslanders, unfortunately, that has not been Labor’s way since Ms Palaszczuk snatched a surprise win from former LNP premier Campbell Newman in 2015. Queensland government debt was soaring towards $90bn months before the coronavirus crisis appeared. A fortnight ago, economist Gene Tunny, a former commonwealth Treasury official and director of Adept Economics, forecast the effects of the pandemic could see state debt hit $100bn by 2023-24.
For two terms, the hallmark of the Palaszczuk government has been growing public service numbers and wages. It has also hired consultants such as former Labor MP and official Mike Kaiser and former premier Anna Blight’s chief-of-staff Nicole Scurrah to advise on jobs and how to cut the use of consultants. Last year, however, Ms Palaszczuk showed she was capable of pragmatism and changing course when it comes to survival. After years of blocking the central Queensland Adani coalmine, she steamrolled its approval immediately after Labor was clobbered in Queensland in the federal election.
The investigation by the state’s corruption watchdog into Ms Trad’s alleged interference in the appointment of a school principal — which she vehemently denies — is fodder for the LNP opposition. Ms Trad was under assessment by the CCC for several months last year after she failed to properly declare an investment property her family company bought close to a planned station of the $5.4bn Cross River Rail project. She was cleared of corruption but found to have broken ministerial rules. But if the LNP is to take advantage of Labor’s woes, it needs to produce a credible blueprint of its own for rebooting the Queensland economy in the short term and, in the longer term, reducing the government’s mountain of debt. Like Labor, it has ruled out asset sales or leases.
The performance of the Queensland economy, which is the third-largest in the nation and on a par with NSW for export earnings, behind Western Australia, is an important determinant of national prosperity. From Cairns and the Whitsundays to the Gold and Sunshine coasts, Queensland regions that rely heavily on tourism have struggled during the COVID-19 lockdown. With a resumption of international travel months away, their recovery will be hamstrung, even as Australia opens up.Ms Trad’s departure is a blow to her Left faction, which dominates the government and gained a new member last week when backbencher Jim Madden defected from the Right. The incoming deputy premier, Health Minister Steven Miles, is in the Left. But as the state faces its toughest economic times for decades, pragmatism and not ideology or the whims of public sector unions must prevail. Ms Palaszczuk, as the leader, bears greater responsibility than Ms Trad for the state of Queensland’s books. In looking to the future, she and the new treasurer, like NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet, must look to tax reform and scrapping inefficient imposts such as payroll tax and stamp duty. These discourage economic activity. They must also be prepared to stare down unaffordable public sector union wage demands and not stand in the way of workplace relations reform. In the lead-up to the state election and beyond, pro-growth policies will be the path to recovery.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Weeding out would-be teachers who fail test	The Australian	Breaking the cycle of underachievement in education is vital Many parents of schoolchildren will be alarmed and cross, but not surprised, to learn almost one in 10 trainee teachers falls short of acceptable literacy and numeracy standards. The problem is not new. It reflects fundamental weaknesses in our education system that have worried parents and employers for many years. Australia’s slide in international testing bears out the trend. When poor literacy and numeracy skills of trainee teachers were identified a few years ago, the Coalition introduced LANTITE (Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students) in 2016. It is a good check, requiring students to reach a certain level of numeracy and literacy before being allowed to graduate. But what is disconcerting, as Richard Ferguson reports on Monday, is that the situation has deteriorated further in four years. Last year, 9.3 per cent of students failed to meet the numeracy benchmark and 8.3 per cent failed in literacy; worse than in 2016-17.
Some states introduced tougher minimum ATAR scores for teaching courses. These will help. Students’ literacy and numeracy issues also need to be identified much earlier, as MultiLit senior research fellow Jennifer Buckingham says. Universities have a choice when students sit literacy and numeracy tests; most schedule them in the final year of degrees. That is too late. There is a case, as Blaise Joseph, an education research fellow at the Centre for Independent Studies, suggests, for making LANTITE an entrance exam for teaching courses. Universities also need to take responsibility for taking students’ money for four years and passing their coursework. Surely, over that time, difficulties with reading and numeracy are apparent? It also remains problematic that too many universities lowered the bar for entry to teaching degrees. More “bottoms on seats’’ in lecture halls mean more government funding. Quantity not quality. These and other deep-seated problems are all pertinent to reading standards.
The Australian has covered these issues for decades. We have exposed the lack of phonics in classrooms (teaching children to read by sounding out syllables); we have highlighted indifferent NAPLAN (National Assessment Program — Literacy and Numeracy) results, and reported on postmodern senior English courses more about pop culture and sociology than literature. Too often, at all stages of education, reading comes a poor last. So does numeracy, as exasperated parents know as they cast around, at great expense, for a maths tutor to get teenagers through Years 11 and 12. Calls to emphasise “the basics’’ in classrooms have not been heeded, although some schools, across all education systems, regions and socio-economic groups, are doing brilliantly. In general, students from homes with few books and parents who do not encourage them are the most disadvantaged. LANTITE is doing its job: weeding out would-be teachers who should not be in classrooms. Education Minister Dan Tehan wants to see more students in teaching, English and maths courses at university, through cuts to fees. Quality must be the priority.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
PM’s questionable advice for revered commissioner	The Australian	Bret Walker’s task is to get the truth on a COVID-19 debacle
Scott Morrison has made a surprising judgment call by inserting himself into the Special Commission of Inquiry into the Ruby Princess, which is being led by Bret Walker SC. On Wednesday the Prime Minister not only became a commentator on a probe entirely independent of any government, he also sought to influence the way Mr Walker is conducting hearings. Mr Morrison’s intervention appeared to be considered, given he raised his concerns not once but twice via interviews at opposite ends of the day. The issue involved testimony by NSW Health epidemiologist Kelly-Anne Ressler, the first departmental witness called. During the course of Ms Ressler’s evidence on Tuesday, as Yoni Bashan observed, the commissioner, “normally avuncular and affable, became impatient and barbed, his questions sharpening to a withering cross-examination”. The expert in disease surveillance broke down in tears, conceding national protocols were not followed to the letter in the department’s dealings with the Ruby Princess and other ships.
Speaking to radio broadcaster Ray Hadley, Mr Morrison said he found the tearful images of Ms Ressler “very distressing”. He paid tribute to nurses, doctors and first responders, as well as health officials, working day and night for months. The Prime Minister thanked Ms Ressler “for the great job that she’s been seeking to do”. “I know we’ve got to get to the truth on this sort of stuff, but I mean, my first blush on that one, and that’s not to call into question the independence of the royal commission or anything like that,” he said. “But I found that a bit out of line, and I think to see her reduced to that under that sort of aggressive line of what would appear questioning, I know you’ve got to get the balance right on this one. And I would hope that Mr Walker would reflect on that.” Mr Morrison’s compassion for a human being under extreme stress during a crisis testing all of us is understandable. But showing empathy for the bureaucrat is one thing. Urging an independent commissioner investigating the circumstances of a fatal disaster of epic proportions to adjust his manner is another thing entirely. Mr Walker has been commissioned to do a difficult job in quick time, amid the poisonous blame-shifting between the NSW and federal governments. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian tried to fit up Australian Border Force officers for the catastrophic decision to allow 2700 cruise passengers to disembark at Sydney’s Circular Quay on March 19 without health checks — even though some passengers on board were showing signs of respiratory illness. Since then more than 664 passengers have tested positive for coronavirus and 21 have died of complications relating to COVID-19. The ship also has been linked to cluster outbreaks in northwest Tasmania and New Zealand.
Then on Wednesday evening Mr Morrison doubled down. Samantha Maiden of news.com.au asked why the Prime Minister felt the need to step in and defend health officials. Again, Mr Morrison spoke of the great job they were doing. “I’m not looking to compromise in any way, shape or form and nor did I the integrity or independence of the royal commission, it needs to do its job. I respect it’s what it needs to do,” he said. That’s correct, but it is incongruous with his remarks directed at Mr Walker: “What we saw there was a public health official just trying to do her best. And she was there and put in that situation. And the subject of, I think, quite some aggressive questioning.” Mr Morrison is casting himself as empathiser in chief, providing succour in a “really hard time”. He added that the expectation officials were “going to get every call right, every single time” was “very unrealistic”. No one claims they can. Yet Mr Morrison is watering down accountability — the antithesis of the high standards he set for Canberra’s public service chiefs. Mr Morrison conceded: “We’ve got to find out what happened there.” But with the inquiry under way, he concluded: “How you do things sometimes is very important, at all times. And I just hope that the royal commissioner would reflect on that line that he took.” Again, it’s not the Prime Minister’s role to bring Mr Walker into line. What good can it possibly do? Seeking to influence the conduct of an independent commissioner can only hurt the integrity of a crucial inquiry.
Mr Morrison must get the balance right. He should be adroit enough to show compassion for an official in distress without schooling a storeyed master of interrogation. Mr Walker is perhaps the nation’s most revered barrister, a veteran of inquiries across a vast range of matters of the utmost importance. While there may be sympathy for Ms Ressler, who did not make the critical decisions she was questioned about, that is beside the point. She was there to provide answers. Yes, there’s often an element of theatre in such inquiries, with displays of human frailty.Yet it’s ultimately a forum of inquisition in the public interest. Mr Walker’s mission is to get to the truth, without fear or favour. He should not be hindered in this quest.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

Boris finds a new Brexit anthem	The Australian	Britain is ready to waltz out the door if there’s no trade deal with EU With “endgame” negotiations over a make-or-break Brexit trade deal with the EU deadlocked, it is no surprise Boris Johnson has been heard loudly singing Waltzing Matilda in his Downing Street office. Doing so sends a message that leaders of the 27 EU nations would be wise not to ignore as the clock ticks towards what is effectively a deadline on Thursday (when EU leaders meet) that will decide whether Britain finally exits the EU on December 31 on the basis of the long-apprehended “no deal” Brexit.
Four years and five months since British voters, in the 2016 Brexit referendum, made clear their determination to reassert Britain’s national sovereignty and “take back control” from Brussels, and 11 months since the start of trade negotiations, the chances of the negotiations succeeding appear remote. With the British Prime Minister involved in “one final throw of the dice” with EU president Ursula von der Leyen, talks are apparently getting nowhere.
Underlining the gloomy prospects for success, the government in London has activated its Operation Yellowhammer emergency plans. These outline ways to keep Britain going after January 1 without any formal arrangements for basic trade, Customs, tariffs, and transport between it and the EU. The EU is far and away Britain’s biggest trading partner, taking 43 per cent of all British exports and providing it with 51 per cent of its imports. Chaos looms.
Despite leading the Brexit campaign, Mr Johnson has always made clear his preferred option for Britain to leave the EU with a trade deal. But if he is worried by the prospect of a “no deal” Brexit becoming a reality, he isn’t showing it. The so-called “Australian option” has always been touted as the fallback position in the event of no deal. It was clearly on Mr Johnson’s mind as news emerged of the way EU leaders, particularly French President Emmanuel Macron, were making it as difficult as possible to conclude a trade deal.
If there is no deal before December 31, Britain will automatically fall back to conducting its trade relations under World Trade Organisation rules, just as Australia and other major economies including the US, China and Brazil do. Mr Johnson has frequently held up Australia as an admired example of a country that maintains good trading relations with the EU and countries across the world.
From the start, EU leaders have shown little understanding of the principles of sovereignty and “taking back control” that underpinned the 2016 Brexit victory and Mr Johnson’s big win as the champion of Brexit in last December’s British general election.
Mr Johnson’s optimism that under WTO rules Britain, like Australia, will be able to sustain its trade relationships with Europe and the rest of the world is well founded. But it reflects poorly on the lack of foresight of EU leaders, particularly Mr Macron, who have made it as difficult as possible to reach a trade deal. In what was expected to be the final week of negotiations, they have doubled down on their disregard for what British voters opted for in the Brexit referendum. On such politically potent issues as the right of EU countries to fish in British waters, they have made life even harder for Mr Johnson. They have demanded to be allowed to continue to take an incredible 60 per cent of the tonnage caught in British waters for at least 10 years. Other major differences seem unbridgeable: the EU’s demand for British alignment with Brussels’ standards on workers’ rights, the environment, and the so-called “level playing field”, which dictates how state aid to industry will work in Britain and affect competition with the EU after December 31.
If there is no deal, it will be because EU leaders have scant regard for the fundamental principles Britons voted for when they supported Brexit. They were what the referendum was all about. The stalemate in the trade negotiations shows EU leaders still do not understand it. Conducting its trade relations under WTO rules with countries across the world, including Australia, with which it is negotiating a free-trade deal, will open up vast new opportunities for Britain. It will also show up the short-sightedness and unreasonableness of the EU leaders.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
National security risks rise on China push for 5G tech	The Australian	Britain opts for Huawei and that’s bad news for Five Eyes
Boris Johnson’s rash decision to allow Huawei a slice of Britain’s 5G network is odd, shortsighted and worrying, especially for the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which share intelligence material with it as part of the Five Eyes alliance. What was the British Prime Minister thinking? His own security services raised major concerns about the Chinese telecom equipment supplier. Not only that, Donald Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had urged British leaders and officials to boycott Huawei products, again based on security fears. Australian Strategic Policy Institute executive director Peter Jennings called it a “disastrous decision”, warning of lasting damage to the Washington-London alliance. As well, the move may make it more difficult for Britain to strike trade deals in the post-Brexit era.
Britain said Huawei would be given permission to build only “non-core” parts of the 5G and full-fibre network, and could not exceed 35 per cent of the project. The firm will be allowed to provide only peripheral equipment, such as base stations and antennae that connect the core to consumers’ devices; it will be banned from sensitive locations such as military bases and nuclear sites. Still, Britain’s National Security Council concluded the many security risks the Chinese company presented could be managed. But why risk anything? This is where the short-term financial desperation kicks in for Mr Johnson. Huawei is embedded in Britain’s telecoms infrastructure and removing it from the next-generation project would have been expensive and caused delays in delivery. Given there are few competitors and Huawei is at the forefront of technology, Britain found itself in 5G no man’s land.
In August 2018, one of Malcolm Turnbull’s last acts as prime minister was to ban Chinese firms from a role in Australia’s future 5G network on the grounds such state-owned companies could be exploited by Beijing’s spying services. New Zealand followed suit. Canada has not yet decided whether to ban the Chinese. Mr Turnbull later described it as a “hedge against adverse contingencies” in case relations with China soured. It was a smart move, opting for long-term cyber security over short-run commercial advantages offered by the likes of Huawei. For this prudent act of national self-interest, Canberra has been shunted to the diplomatic deep freezer ever since.
A rare insight into the thinking of our intelligence chiefs was provided in October 2018 by then Australian Signals Directorate chief Mike Burgess, now ASIO director-general. In a speech titled “Coming out from the shadows”, he revealed “my advice was to exclude high-risk vendors from the entirety of 5G networks”. Why? Because “a potential threat anywhere in the network is a threat to the whole network”. A computer engineer, Mr Burgess explained 5G technology was at the centre of applications from driverless cars to power and water supply. The stakes were much higher than simply protecting confidentiality, important as that was. “It is also about integrity and availability of the data and systems that we rely on in our everyday lives,” he said. “Getting security right for critical infrastructure is paramount.” Huawei has repeatedly denied claims its gear could be used by the Chinese state to spy on countries or knock out key infrastructure. As we reported on Thursday, Mr Johnson’s decision has prompted the Australian arm of the company to launch a “charm offensive” to remove the ban on its participation in our 5G rollout. “We want to know what the rules are,” its local boss said, adding Huawei “was not responsible for the actions of the Chinese government”. Too cute by half. As we have argued, Huawei functions under Chinese law, entitling the Chinese state to insist on the company providing digital access to exchanges between Western allies using its systems. China has a notorious record of stealing Western intellectual property, which is at the core of concern about the Chinese tech giant.Right now, China is winning the 5G technology race through a mix of theft, innovation, subsidies and coercion. As Mr Turnbull has argued, the US and its allies should give “urgent priority” to developing their own next-gen network in the face of cyber attacks. As a former NASA chief warns, the nation that dominates 5G will reap economic, military and political advantages for decades. Closing the technology gap must be top of the Five Eyes agenda.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Covid tests democratic system	The Australian	Bureaucrats should not usurp the role of our elected leaders
Every aspect of our society and its institutions has been under intense stress this year. Damaging bushfires were followed by a highly contagious virus that has ravaged our home lives and economy. The resilience of every Australian has been sorely tested. COVID-19 has killed many, though the nation has been spared the worst of its lethal potential. While mistakes have been made at every level of government, our leaders can draw quiet satisfaction from the fact the crisis could have been far worse. Our hospitals have not been overwhelmed. We have been spared the improvised morgues and mass burials.
However, this should not fuel complacency about the health of our democratic institutions. While Victoria stands out for the incompetence and opacity of its response, the pandemic has highlighted serious weakness in our institutions of government at federal and state levels. Some of these undesirable trends have been evident for years. The politicisation of our public services has been a source of concern for some time. Few outside the political and media elite comprehend the full extent of this phenomenon. Long gone is the era of the omnipotent mandarin whose permanent tenure ensured that they provided fearless and frank advice to their ministers. Of course, no system is perfect and sometimes entrenched bureaucrats believed the mandate of their political masters was merely an aberration of transient inconvenience to be quietly defied until a more amenable government was elected.
Writing on Tuesday, Gary Banks identified a crisis in our bureaucracy. The proliferation of political appointees undoubtedly has led to some compromise of merit in senior bureaucrats’ appointments. Compensating somewhat for that, Professor Banks argued, political appointees may enjoy higher levels of trust from their political masters. But COVID has exposed more than a crisis in bureaucracy. It has exposed a crisis in our democratic institutions. Regardless of the political complexion of any government, we wish them success in managing the health and economic crises. The former has responded to tough measures. The worst effects of the latter — low growth, high unemployment and crippling debt — may endure for years.
During the pandemic we have seen the text and the spirit of our Constitution ignored and many of our cherished liberties undermined, if not trampled on. Parliaments have barely sat. When they have, it has been on a reduced basis. This has led to the steady expansion of executive diktat, too often enforced by heavy-handed policing. The images of the arrest of a pregnant Victorian woman for allegedly inciting protests online were grotesque and unimaginable in Australia a year ago.
Professor Banks referred to our hybrid “Washminster” form of government, a description that has merit. But the framers of our Constitution consciously eschewed a formal US-style bill of rights. They reposed their faith in the supremacy of the elected parliament. Ministers of the crown were obliged to sit in the popularly elected legislature. Bureaucrats merely advised and implemented policy. We have strayed far from this model. We have done so at our peril. The fact three Victorian bureaucrats seem likely to bear the consequences for the failures of the state’s quarantine is a perversion of our system of responsible government. Governments are elected; between elections the executive answers to the representatives of the people through question time and the committee system. These are not esoteric notions championed by lawyers. They are the lifeblood of our system of government. The tree of liberty is fragile. We must be vigilant to prevent the usurpation of democratic norms by faceless, unelected experts. Our parliaments are the ultimate essential service in times of peril. It is time for our elected leaders to take back the reins and accept responsibility for their actions. That is what responsible government means.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Pointless interstate border closures wreaking havoc	The Australian	Business needs national cabinet to provide a circuit-breaker
Alan Joyce’s logic was sound: “When you have states with zero cases closing their borders to states with zero cases, there doesn’t seem to be any medical reason or health reason or any logical reason for those to remain closed.” The Qantas chief was speaking after announcing the airline’s $2.7bn loss for the financial year, the second-largest in its 100-year history. Many business leaders concur. Sydney Airport chief Geoff Culbert, who has seen domestic passenger numbers at Australia’s largest airport plunge from 2.2 million in May last year to 62,300 this year, also wants a co-ordinated approach to travel restrictions, with clear guidelines for closing or reopening state borders. The peak business, tourism and hospitality groups are seeking a circuit-breaker from Friday’s national cabinet meeting. “We just need some surety,” Restaurant and Catering chief executive Wes Lambert said: “What is the trigger for one state to open to another? Does it exist? Will it always be zero? Or will it be something else? What’s on the horizon for November or December? We’ve finished the previous road map, we need a new one.” With almost 6.5 million active COVID-19 cases across the world, and about 30,000 new cases a day, it would be foolish, for medical reasons, to look at reopening Australia’s international borders. The virus remains prevalent among the small number of people arriving from overseas, who spend 14 days in hotel quarantine at their own expense. And even Mr Joyce concedes that at present, “nobody has an issue with the borders to Victoria being closed”. What is not defensible is the ongoing closures of the Queensland, Tasmanian, West Australian and Northern Territory borders for blatantly political reasons. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is making no secret of her intention to use the issue in her campaign for the state’s election on October 31. Such narrow parochialism is not in her state’s interests or those of the nation. Rather than being dictated to by polls, states should be working with the commonwealth to solve the “border conundrum” and prevent the collapse of the tourism industry, as Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director Simon Westaway says. In addition to lifting many strictures on travel, the states need to relieve unnecessary hardships being suffered by border communities. For example, as Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott points out, 30 Victorian staff employed at the Mount Gambier Bunnings store in South Australia are unable to drive to work.
When Scott Morrison pulled the commonwealth out of businessman Clive Palmer’s High Court challenge against Western Australia’s border closures earlier this month, the Prime Minister said he had talked to West Australian Premier Mark McGowan and proposed a “pandemic” truce. It was to be based on co-operation between the states and commonwealth government, aimed at avoiding a constitutional fight. Mr Morrison said his government would work with the states on a series of principles governing border closures. They are needed now. If states and territories decline to co-operate, the commonwealth has the option to challenge the validity of border closures in accordance with section 92 of the Constitution, which provides for absolute freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse among the states. Amid the current crisis, however, establishing a clear consensus on borders through national cabinet would be more constructive. From their parochial bunkers, the inclination of the states and territories to thumb their noses at the rest of the nation is white-anting morale and detrimental to national recovery. As Simon Benson writes, Mr Morrison will personally appeal to state and territory leaders on Friday to break the border deadlock that has sparked new crises over medical emergencies, agriculture and aviation. At a time when the federal government is dealing with increasing appeals from families and businesses for assistance in resolving problems caused by border closures, it is up to state and territory leaders to show some healthy, practical patriotism. The economy has suffered its worst shock since the Depression caused a decade of hardship. If they are allowed to cling to their border closures, the states will only prolong the COVID crisis.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Industrial peace accord for post-crisis jobs and growth	The Australian	Business, unions and states can make our economy go faster Scott Morrison has delivered a rallying call on job creation, seeking compacts on skills development and industrial relations to underpin recovery after the economy’s stint in intensive care. Canberra, the Prime Minister said in a speech on Tuesday, has a part to play in transition but not through the power of borrowed money. The government will be, he vows, an enthusiastic partner and facilitator of new accords rather than the central controller. The way forward will be via Australian values, strengths and institutions. But Mr Morrison did look over the ditch to encapsulate his modus operandi. In defending the America’s Cup in 2000, Team New Zealand’s chief Peter Blake focused on a single strategic question: Will it make the boat go faster? It’s a test we need to entrench for growth policies that we pursue in a post-pandemic world.
The Prime Minister — mindful of political snags to ambitious industrial relations reform, while capitalising on capital and labour amity — has taken a low-risk approach to workplace change in quick time. He said the system has “retreated to tribalism, conflict and ideological posturing”. Mr Morrison urged parties to “put their weapons down” and focus on settings where everybody can benefit, meaning higher profits, more jobs and increased wages. Working groups will negotiate on five areas: award simplification; enterprise agreement making; casuals and fixed-term employees; compliance and enforcement; and greenfields deals for new enterprises. To smooth the path, Mr Morrison is dropping the union-busting Ensuring Integrity bill.
Enterprise bargaining is busted. The system was meant to deliver flexibility and productivity improvements at the workplace but has become moribund. Labor’s 2009 Fair Work Act says the industrial umpire must be satisfied “each award-covered employee and each prospective award covered employee” would be better off overall under any new agreement. That test is a job killer, especially for small business. But Coalition governments, haunted by Work Choices, have not acted on calls to reform it with a “no disadvantage” test, in the spirit of Paul Keating’s original act. While Mr Morrison says he does not want to tell unions and employers what to do on this matter, he emphasised “if there’s no business, there’s no job. There’s no income. There’s nothing.” The pandemic has led to odd couplings and less black-letter work to rule. The government hopes pragmatism will rule in the recovery.
The other compact for revival is between Canberra and the states. The national cabinet has done its job well, especially in the medical response. Mr Morrison wants to use the co-operative vibe to solve specific problems, such as improving an unresponsive training system. Mr Morrison sketched out reform of a clunky skills system that is failing the needs of industry and students. Often young people go to university when their best choice would be a trade because the training system is difficult to navigate and is decoupled from the job market. Despite the incoherence, complexity and poor quality of the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development, the federal government still hands over $1.5bn in untied funding. Mr Morrison is prepared to offer premiers and chief ministers more money as a carrot if they can improve their training systems, mirroring agreements Canberra has with them on hospitals, incorporating national efficient pricing and activity-based funding.
The existing Council of Australian Governments is overly bureaucratic, its agenda all-encompassing. The new grouping, forged in crisis, has political horsepower, focus and works with speed. Mr Morrison wants job creation to be its new mission. Of course, this will pay huge dividends for states and territories, shoring up their tax bases and attracting companies. NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet has led reform of federal finances. A grand bargain on taxation — where states ditch anti-growth and mobility taxes, such as payroll tax or stamp duty, but are not financially worse off — must be on the cards. Regulations and imposts that destroy jobs or disadvantage small enterprises, such as fringe benefits tax, should be part of a holistic agenda. Although his thrust was industrial relations and skills compacts, Mr Morrison said the focus of supply-side reform had to be “what generates investment and what creates jobs”, or what makes the economy run faster, to draw on the Kiwi sailing motif. The Prime Minister strongly reaffirmed a commitment to open, free and fair trade; to living within our fiscal means; building on our core industrial, financial and resources competencies; and aspiration, “having a go, and getting a go” in his schema. If we want to raise productivity and material living standards, we need better incentives to start businesses, deepen our capital stock and develop new products. We need to properly price infrastructure and reduce hurdles on major projects. Rather than ad hoc capital allowances, the government must put wind in the sails of businesses in October’s budget via a company tax cut. Industrial peace in our time is necessary. But a dynamic business sector, which can compete globally, offers a higher prize for all.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
A new step for our US alliance	The Australian	But Mr Albanese’s speech on Mr Biden harks back to old politics In a farewell call ahead of the Thursday (Australian time) transfer of power in Washington, Scott Morrison and outgoing US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo fittingly “affirmed the unbreakable bond that exists between the US and Australia”. Their joint commitment that both nations will “continue working together to deepen and broaden the US-Australia alliance” reflects the great success of the relationship under the Trump administration and the Coalition in Australia. Given China’s growing belligerence, Mr Pompeo had good reason to thank the Prime Minister for “his steadfast support in promoting our shared values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and our common strategic interests, even in the face of threats from China”. Mr Pompeo and Mr Morrison also noted the increasing importance of the Quad Security Dialogue and the determination of the US, India, Australia and Japan to advance “a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region”. Mr Morrison also had a farewell call with outgoing Vice-President Mike Pence, who has played a gracious and proper role in the transition to the new administration.
Less timely on Wednesday is Anthony Albanese’s Zoom speech to the University of WA on US-Australia relations under a Biden administration. Even before Joe Biden takes office, Mr Albanese is suggesting the Morrison government was behind the eight ball in dealing with the new administration: “Scott Morrison will have his work cut out given his attendance at partisan events with Donald Trump and his failure to build any connections with the Democrats.’’ That dubious proposition is about to be tested and is likely to prove unfounded.
Mr Albanese, incredibly, is more critical of what he terms Mr Morrison’s “poorly managed call for an inquiry, which was always going to take place’’ into the origins of COVID-19 in Wuhan than he was of China’s subsequent trade retaliation against Australia. Far from being inevitable, the World Health Organisation probe was slow to eventuate. Australia, as a credible middle-ranking power, pushed the process forward. Mr Morrison was right to speak up.
Mr Albanese’s efforts to tar Mr Morrison with the same brush as Mr Trump’s extremist supporters went too far. Given recent polling commissioned by building unions showing that Labor is on track to lose its heartland seats of Shortland and Paterson in the Hunter Valley, it is worth questioning whether it reflects Labor’s struggles to retain its traditional blue-collar base. Mr Albanese indulges in sweeping hyperbole, claiming Mr Morrison “remains afraid of the far-right extremist fringe dwellers who make up the bedrock of his personal support — and who he cultivates through the avatars of Trumpists and conspiracy theorists such as Craig Kelly and George Christensen.” Really?
From Australia’s perspective, it is reassuring that Mr Pompeo’s assessment of the importance of the US-Australia alliance is shared by incoming secretary of state Antony Blinken and Mr Biden’s new “Asia tsar”, Kurt Campbell. Despite the chaos of Mr Trump’s ill-tempered departure, there is at least one part of the world about which Democrats and Republicans largely see eye to eye. Mr Biden arrives in the White House with a wealth of foreign policy experience. As vice-president, he was closely involved in Barack Obama’s pivot to Asia. He now has an opportunity to build on it. And, in doing so, the US-Australia alliance will be central. As Mr Morrison says, he and Mr Biden will continue the stewardship of the alliance that is “incredibly important’’ for our region, for Australia’s interests, and for the US.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Helping older people stay home is money well spent	The Australian	But many are being forced into nursing homes for lack of support At the outset of inquiries by the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, former commissioner Richard Tracey, who died in October last year, said the hallmark of a civilised society was “how it treats its most vulnerable people, and our elderly are often among our most physically, emotionally and financially vulnerable. Frail and elderly members of our community deserve to, and should, be looked after in the best possible way.” While many of our frail aged citizens have no alternative but to live in nursing homes to receive the care they require, many older Australians prefer to stay in their own homes, in the communities they know, for as long as possible. Experience shows that is the best option for those concerned, their loved ones who should be lending a hand where possible and for the community at a time when the residential aged-care sector is short of places and staff. The pandemic, in which almost 700 residents died in government-subsidised aged-care facilities, mainly in Victoria, and another 1364 people caught the virus, highlighted weaknesses in the sector. Nursing homes accounted for about three-quarters of the nation’s COVID-19 death toll.
For that reason the Morrison government’s allocation of $1bn to the sector, which will be a centrepiece of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook to be unveiled on Thursday, is badly needed. Most of the allocation, $850m, will fund an extra 10,000 home care packages to enable older Australians to live at home for longer. The spending follows the provision of an additional 23,000 home care packages in the October budget. It will increase the number of Australians receiving in-home care support to 195,600 by June next year.
This is three times as many as when the Coalition was elected in 2013, but it stills falls well short of what is needed. For the past three years, Leading Age Services Australia acting chief advocate Tim Hicks says, his organisation has had a queue of more than 100,000 people awaiting home care packages. The government’s latest allocation, he says, is “just another down payment” on what is needed.
As many as 16,000 people a year have died while waiting for a high-level commonwealth home care package, National Seniors chief executive John McCallum points out in Thursday’s news pages. In one year, Professor McCallum told Olivia Caisley, a further 13,000 older people who had been approved for high-level home care were shifted into aged-care facilities against their wishes because they had to wait for too long. Council of the Ageing chief executive Ian Yates said many people were waiting for more than a year. Older Australians, whose hard work and taxes have done much to build a prosperous nation, deserve better. So do current and future taxpayers. Home care generally is more affordable than nursing homes. The MYEFO funding allocation also boosts resources for mental and allied health services for people in residential aged care, including those in facilities that were affected by COVID-19 outbreaks.
In its interim report in October last year, under the depressing heading “A shocking tale of neglect’’, the royal commission warned that Australia had drifted into “an ageist mindset that undervalues older people and limits their possibilities”. Left out of sight and out of mind, the report said, aged-care services were floundering, fragmented, unsupported and underfunded. Most were poorly managed and too often were “unsafe and seemingly uncaring”. Given the preference of older people to stay in their homes, it was neglect, the royal commission said; too many were left waiting for the services they needed to live safely and well. The royal commission called for urgent action to provide more home care packages to reduce waiting lists, especially for higher-level home care. Scott Morrison says the health and wellbeing of older Australians is an “absolute priority”. It must be. After dropping the ball during the pandemic by not delivering the services and protection frail, vulnerable residents and staff in care facilities needed, the government needed to lift its game. It accepted recommendations of the royal commission special report into aged care and COVID-19, and provided funding to implement them. It is also stepping up home care, funding almost 50,000 packages at a cost of $3.3bn since the royal commission’s interim report last year. That long waiting times remain a problem shows the challenges policymakers and taxpayers face as Australians age. Funding, as well as training and providing skilled aged-care workers to plug staff shortages, will be increasingly important.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Welfare reform is well overdue	The Australian	But taxpayers shouldn’t have to fork out more billions for the benefits
Giving the unemployed the best chance and encouragement to find work, at least cost to taxpayers, is one of the most important tasks of government. And when more than three million Australians are still dependent on JobSeeker or JobKeeper, it is critically important. News the government is considering replacing the old Newstart payment, badged JobSeeker since March last year, with a streamlined payment replacing other low-value payments is welcome, if overdue. In 2014, the McClure review recommended an overhaul of the welfare system, including scrapping more than 20 payments and replacing them with four better-targeted payments.
While details remain thin, The Australian revealed on Monday that Josh Frydenberg was considering a single increased payment that would leave all recipients better off. Most economists, the ACTU, employer and welfare groups, the Reserve Bank and Treasury have tacitly or explicitly called for an increase in the rate.
On Monday, Patrick McClure himself welcomed signs the Coalition was about to announce a reform package before JobSeeker was due to revert to the old rate on March 31. The base Newstart payment of $565 a fortnight is only 37 per cent of the full-time minimum wage and 17 per cent of the average wage, far lower than in most other OECD nations. Even with an extra $140 a fortnight of rent assistance available, many politicians and business leaders have admitted they could not live on $50 a day.
Indexed to consumer price inflation rather than wages, which tend to grow faster, the payments have fallen across time and no longer are in keeping with community standards. There’s no question a host of obscure legacy payments, such as pharmaceutical allowance, energy supplements, telephone allowance, literacy supplement and a utilities allowance that ranges from as little as $4 a fortnight, should go. But how much it should be increased is a thornier issue: too high and the unemployed will be reluctant to seek work.
As revealed by The Australian on Tuesday, the Blueprint Institute has recommended bringing Australia into line with most other OECD nations, which provide a higher initial payment after workers become unemployed to cushion the shock and provide the resources to look for work, followed by a much lower payment to discourage long-term unemployment. The new think tank, which has links to the Liberal Party, recommends a payment of 70 per cent of workers’ previous wages, capped at $35,000 every two years. It would cost an extra $9bn a year, to be funded by an increase in the Medicare levy of one percentage point. “By paying into the system, people earn the right to access it when they fall on hard times. Because an unemployment spell can happen to any of us, everyone who contributes also benefits,” the authors argue. While reform is desirable, including a higher rate, a contributory system would be out of kilter with the history of Australia’s welfare system, which has favoured flat, heavily means-tested payments rather than European-style social security payments linked to prior earnings. Moreover, the last thing the economy needs is even higher income tax (which is what the Medicare levy is in reality), which is already higher than it should be, as many reports from the Henry review onwards have made clear. Reform is desirable but shouldn’t be a net cost to taxpayers, who have already witnessed their collective debts rise by hundreds of billions of dollars in a year. The government should resist political pressure to ensure no losers from any change. Coronavirus restrictions have cost many businesses hundreds of millions of dollars in the past 12 months. If temporary pain for the greater good is acceptable for them, then it should be politically acceptable for some recipients of government aid to see a small reduction in payments. Unemployment, after all, is meant to be temporary. The pandemic understandably has distracted government, but with hundreds of advisers and thousands of highly paid bureaucrats it should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Rebuilding confidence in construction sector is vital	The Australian	Buyers are entitled to know about builders’ track records
Public confidence about investing and living in high-rise apartments has taken a battering in recent years. After 72 people died in London’s Grenfell Tower fire disaster in July 2017, concern about combustible cladding on high-rise buildings quickly spread to Australia. About 500 buildings in Victoria were found to need rectification to remove flammable cladding, and similar numbers were discovered in NSW. Concerns escalated in late 2018 when residents of the 38-storey, 392-apartment Opal Tower in Sydney’s Olympic Park were forced to evacuate after cracks appeared on Christmas Eve. Some were unable to return for almost a year. And in June last year, residents of the 132 apartments in Sydney’s Mascot Towers had to abandon their homes after engineers became concerned about continued cracking in the building’s primary support structure and facade masonry.
The evacuations reinforced the importance of the “caveat emptor” principle to potential owner-occupiers and investors. They also pointed to the need for more effective building regulation. In response, as Yoni Bashan reported on Tuesday, the NSW government has proposed a crackdown on the construction industry. It plans to give regulators the power to block suspect developers from erecting high-rise unit towers. Builders also will be subject to a quality-rating regime based on their histories. Factors such as workplace safety, their track record on customer complaints, the age of businesses, financial credibility and any evidence of phoenixing (creating a new company to continue the business of a company that has been liquidated deliberately to avoid paying its creditors) will be taken into account in determining ratings. Provided it is transparent and easily accessible, the system should go a long way to informing developers in their choice of builders. Savvy apartment buyers also will appreciate the chance to access such data. The reforms are long overdue. Strata Community Association NSW president Chris Duggan believes they will give “millions of NSW residents” peace of mind.
While responsibility for building safety rests with the states, the problem is a national issue, which is why the NSW measures are likely to form a blueprint for a national shake-up. Building ministers meet next month, when NSW Better Regulation and Innovation Minister Kevin Anderson will push for aspects of the plan to be adopted nationally. Given the need to restore confidence to the sector, industry, in general, is supportive of the reforms. Without firm measures, lack of confidence in the building sector will undercut the economy and jobs. Building accounts for about 7 per cent of GDP. The burden of insurance premiums, which soared by 10 times or more — by hundreds of thousands of dollars per project — after the crises also has become a major problem.Neither NSW Labor nor the Greens believe the regulations, which are yet to pass the state’s upper house, go far enough. They want a building commission, rather a single building commissioner, to police the sector. What matters will be the effectiveness of the scrutiny applied to the sector.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Dangers of Easter complacency	The Australian	By flattening infection curve we’re taking pressure off ICUs
The good news is the COVID-19 epidemiological curve is flattening in Australia. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said on Tuesday, however, that it’s too early to tell whether this welcome trajectory will be significant or sustained. So the clear message from the national cabinet is social distancing must continue and Australians should stay at home and not undertake unnecessary travel over Easter. Scott Morrison said hitting the road over the coming holiday period could “completely undo everything we’ve achieved” in the fight against the disease. The Prime Minister reiterated we would be living with coronavirus and restrictions on movement and gatherings for at least six months. As a community, we need to guard against nascent euphoria and its problem child, complacency. With the number of cases closing in on 6000, and 46 deaths, we must ensure the inevitable increase in infections over winter occurs at a pace our hospital system can handle.
On Tuesday Mr Morrison and Dr Murphy released information about the theoretical scenario modelling that has underpinned the nation’s COVID-19 response. Although we have completed more than 304,000 tests and have one of the most rigorous testing rates in the world, we still lack the required data for homegrown modelling; that will come as testing is broadened and better information comes to hand about community transmission. Dr Murphy said the key issue of concern was that more than 500 people had acquired the virus from someone who did not know they had COVID-19. Right now, we are depending on mathematical models based on overseas results. What they tell us is the measures we’ve adopted — travel bans, quarantine, better hygiene and social distancing — have flattened the curve so hospital intensive care units are not overwhelmed. To date, only 8 per cent of cases have required hospitalisation and ICU. The modelling confirms that with social distancing and an expansion in ICU capacity, everyone who needs an ICU bed in the course of the pandemic could access one.Authorities claim our strategy of control and suppression has bought us time to prepare. As more real data is collected and the noise removed from the effect of returning travellers, local models will be more useful in understanding community transmission and anticipating strains on health systems. That will give decision-makers a strong tool to manipulate the policy dial on restrictions and thus restore oxygen to the economy. As Mr Morrison said, unlike many countries, we have the chance to respond from “a position of relative control”. “We can tailor our interventions to gain the most benefit and minimise the cost to society,” he said. That’s a consoling thought as the number of deaths rises, the jobless queue gets longer and more businesses struggle to stay afloat. Keeping the public fully informed about progress and carefully explaining the rationale behind the health and economic responses will prepare us mentally for the challenging months to come.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
NBN shovel-ready for jobs of today and the future	The Australian	COVID has made fast broadband a must for home workers The Morrison government has pitched its $4.5bn upgrade of the National Broadband Network as a shovel-ready jobs measure and much-needed technology response to a new work-at-home era ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the history of the NBN, critics have wasted no time in claiming the Coalition messed up in not accepting the Rudd government’s initial proposal for a national rollout of fibre-to-the-home from the outset.
While always strongly favouring faster internet, The Australian has been a consistent critic of the poor policy that has dogged the NBN from its conception under Labor and the reformed rollout under the Coalition. Labor’s plan lacked a cost-benefit analysis and involved the creation of the NBN as a government monopoly. The Rudd-era rollout did not deliver the promised results and was reminiscent of the ALP’s other great fiasco, the “pink batts” home insulation scheme. Under the revised NBN plan overseen by Malcolm Turnbull, consumers too often were not getting the service or download speeds they had been promised.
These criticisms stand. Nonetheless, new plans by the Morrison government to offer a true fibre-to-the-premises service to individuals and companies willing to pay for it is welcome. COVID-19 has changed a lot of things, including the business case for NBN Co to expand its service more quickly so taxpayers one day can recoup the heavy investment they have made in the NBN through a sale of government equity in the company.
The pandemic has hastened the evolution of the digital revolution and taken the business case for the NBN with it. In 2010, the average data use by households was 10 gigabytes. Last year, it was 258GB. With COVID restrictions and increased working from home, daytime traffic has risen by 70 per cent with uploads up 110 per cent because of the increased demands of videoconferencing. Communications Minister Paul Fletcher says the COVID-19 response helped bring forward demand that otherwise would have taken years to play out, and at least some of it will be permanent.
Increased use has translated into better financial performance for NBN Co, with revenue up 36 per cent and capacity bolstered through $6.1bn recently raised on private debt markets.
The new plan is that by 2023, 75 per cent of all fixed-line premises will be able to order up to 1 gigabit per second service. Unlike existing arrangements where householders must pay for fibre connection from the node to the premises, NBN Co will lay the fibre if the customer signs up to a high-speed package. NBN Co intends to finance the project with borrowings against future cashflows. Mr Fletcher says it is more efficient for NBN Co to move to the next upgrade phase now than to downsize its workforce and ramp it up later. He says present indications are that by 2023, the fibre-to-the-node rollout would have paid for itself and taxpayers could expect to see a return on their investment.
A rollout of fibre-to-the-home allows the ALP to claim it had things right all along. This may be true, but economics and business don’t always work that way. What is inescapable is that the world has changed in response to the pandemic and will continue to do so. As technology editor David Swan has written, COVID-19 has proved what many knew already: our society is moving towards more remote work, more online collaboration and an economy that is heavily reliant on digital services and internet infrastructure. We can fully capitalise on those opportunities only if we have reliable ultra-fast broadband that allows us to work from home at the same pace and with the same capabilities as if we were in an office. Record low interest rates make it an excellent time to borrow to invest in forward-thinking infrastructure projects of all kinds. The imperative is jobs, and the NBN plan is designed to deliver 25,000 of them. It is galling that Australia is still placed 62nd in the world broadband speed rankings. New technologies such as 5G will provide much needed competition for the NBN and greater mobility, but at a cost. We are in a different world post COVID-19, one that demands high-quality connectivity and strategies that will secure jobs today and underpin the infrastructure needs of the future.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Time bomb in the Third World	The Australian	COVID-19 crisis could be overtaken by greater catastrophes
In the present global economic environment, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres doubtless will struggle to get the $US2bn ($3.3bn) he believes is needed urgently to help combat coronavirus in the developing world. But it will be a pity if the international community ignores his warning about the “ticking time bomb” the pandemic presents across vast areas of medically under-resourced Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, and the need to defeat it there as much as in the developed world if victory is to be achieved. Estimates that more than two billion people, as Mr Guterres said, “lack clean water and soap with which to do the most basic act of self-protection against the virus — washing their hands” sum up the enormity of the challenge. So does Mr Guterres’s warning most “do not have homes in which to socially distance or self-isolate … and, should they become critically ill, they have no way of accessing a healthcare system that can provide a hospital bed and a ventilator”.
Ascertaining the extent of the crisis looming in the developing world is not easy. Indonesia, for example, the world’s fourth most populous nation with 272 million people, has reported 1285 cases and 114 deaths. But academics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine claimed last week that was only 2 per cent of actual infections. Similar doubts surround numbers in war-ravaged Syria, with an unlikely three cases; Bangladesh, with a population of 160 million and 48 cases; Somalia, with three; and Myanmar, with eight. As much as the developing world may fall short on verifiable statistics, however, so does it present fertile ground for the deadly pandemic’s spread. Africa has two doctors for 10,000 people in cities. Italy, as it faces an enormous battle against the pandemic, has 41. Almost 600 million Africans, 60 per cent of urban dwellers, live in fetid, overcrowded slums with little hygiene.For the world’s 70 million refugees, conditions are worse. Sprawling camps housing millions of Syrian refugees are already plagued by disease. The al-Hawl camp houses 70,000, mainly women and children who fled Islamic State. They lack food, water and basic medical services. In the Gaza Strip, two million Palestinians are crammed together cheek by jowl, their only real hope Israel’s willingness to help contain the pandemic. If India’s reporting is to be believed, the country of 1.3 billion people has 1024 cases and 27 deaths. A leading virologist has warned, however, that India is in the early stages of a COVID-19 avalanche with potentially hundreds of millions of cases. Yet across the developing world, testing — so vital to the battle — is poor. By March 20 India had tested only 14,514 people, Indonesia 2028 and South Africa, with 2.5 million of its 60 million people afflicted by HIV, 6438. The picture across poorer countries in Latin America is similarly one of few resources and little expertise. The need to meet the challenge facing the Third World is, as Mr Guterres said, no less vital than it is in the developed world.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Until the facts are known, China is under suspicion	The Australian	COVID-19 will alter strategic dynamics as well as economies
China’s ambition to be a respected member of the international community of nations will unravel further if it does not heed growing calls to “come clean” over the genesis and spread of the COVID-19 virus. Transparency, as Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Sunday, is vital. Beijing, if it does not want to be regarded as an ongoing danger to world health, should accept her suggestion for an independent global review, outside the untrustworthy World Health Organisation, to “get to the bottom” of the coronavirus origins and how and why it spread from Wuhan. As of Sunday night, it had killed 160,700 people from 2.3 million cases.
Like Senator Payne, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned China of the need to “open up” and “come clean” in explaining “exactly how this virus spread”. So has British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, acting prime minister in place of Boris Johnson, who is still recovering from COVID-19. Amid pressure from within the Conservative Party for the British government to review its controversial decision to allow Huawei to participate in aspects of the UK’s 5G network, Mr Raab warned there could be no “business as usual” with China until after the pandemic. Senator Payne also hinted at a changed relationship with China post-pandemic, saying “all of these things will have to be reviewed … considered in the light of change in the world economy, in the light of changes in international health security”.
Addressing expectations that governments and companies will want to diversify their trading partners in the post-coronavirus world, Trade Minister Simon Birmingham has warned Australian businesses “to not have all your eggs in one basket”. Former foreign minister Julie Bishop also spoke of the likelihood of “a very different world when we have (passed through) this pandemic … many nations will be looking to diversify and bring a greater domestic focus to supply chains”.
Despite its economy contracting by 6.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2020, the first decline since 1992, Beijing is apparently paying little heed to the views of its trading partners. It is more intent on seizing a strategic advantage while the US remains incapacitated, as Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and a former deputy secretary for strategy in the Defence Department, wrote in Inquirer on Saturday. China is also intent on positioning itself as the saviour of much of the world, sending medical equipment and doctors, building political indebtedness and claiming its authoritarianism is doing better at beating the virus than the US and other democracies.
US intelligence agencies are probing speculation, fuelled by Donald Trump, that the virus might have originated in China’s leading biological research establishment, Wuhan’s Institute of Virology, located close to the city’s notorious “wet” markets. Chinese spokesmen, citing the WHO, insist “there is no evidence coronavirus was made in a lab”. Other matters, too, demand investigation. Early on, when a novel coronavirus was suspected of causing flu-like cases in central China, whistleblower Dr Li Wenliang, working in the epicentre of COVID-19, raised the ire of the communist state when he attempted to warn other doctors on social media about an emerging virus. Chinese authorities made him sign a letter stating he had made false comments about the virus, of which he later died. In a Lancet article, researchers observed the first diagnosis was made on December 1 — a month before China alerted the WHO. China was also dangerously slow in alerting the world. Yet at the time the virus had only just begun to spread, in January and early February, Chinese businesses across the world, including property developers in Australia, were buying up tonnes of medical supplies from unsuspecting companies to send back to China. As late as February 13, China’s embassy in Canberra was expressing “deep regret and dissatisfaction” over Australian restrictions on travel from China, claiming they were “extreme measures’’ and an “overreaction’’. China has a lot of explaining to do.It must not be allowed to brush aside its responsibility for a catastrophe destroying lives and plunging the world into its worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, who has recovered from the virus, is correct in saying accountability would “certainly be demanded of us if Australia was at the epicentre of this virus”.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Colour the garden in winter with camellias	Bay of Plenty Times	Camellias are NOT old fashioned and suit Tauranga gardens very well. They are excellent to use as backbone planting and for colour in the dreary winter months and are wonderful all-purpose easy to grow, versatile shrubs that look good all year round.
The camellia varieties of today are much better than the old ones from years gone by.
Many can be espaliered along fence lines to give a soft touch to ugly wooden fences. Planted as backbone shrubs to give a wonderful green foil and pretty flowers in the winter. Used as hedging plants, groundcover plants, or simply planted in pots. They make excellent container specimens especially if you add in some colourful annual plantings around their base to give a seasonal change to the look.
There are three types of camellias: sasanqua, japonica and reticulata.
Sasanqua camellias are the first to flower from March-August. They are great for landscaping as specimens, screens or hedges, espaliered or in pots and have white, pink or red flowers. Setsugekka with its white blooms and yellow stamens is our most popular variety, especially for hedges. Early Pearly is also a stunning white and Yuletide is a good red with yellow stamens which is more of a compact grower.
Japonicas flower a bit later from June-September. These are the best known type of camellia and there are dozens of gorgeous varieties with differing flower colours and sizes varying from miniatures of less than 5cm up to big semi double flowers as large as 20cm. Many of the varieties today are chosen for their flower durability. No longer do we have flowers that mark in the rain or drop off as one big bloom. Now we have ones that hold their blooms through the season and the flowers just drop petals, thus not making such a mess. Fairy Blush is a favourite of mine, along with Sweet Jane and Quintessence as a groundcover, and it’s fragrant. I also love the miniature Itty Bit.
Reticulatas are the largest flowering camellias, with some blooms up to 24cm; more like the size of a soup plate! They flower from June-August too, but you do need plenty of room for these in the garden to get the full benefit from the bush and flower display.
Plant camellias with plenty of Magic Compost or Magic Garden Mix available here at Decor and some ICan Slow Food. If planting into containers make sure you use a quality potting mix such as Daltons Premium Tub Mix.
You can trim and thin camellias to keep them to the size you want so a bird can fly through, and feed them a few times annually with acid fertiliser and they will be happy for many years.
Now is the time to select them as new stocks are in and many are in flower.

RBA finally recognises a glass-half-empty economy	The Australian	Canberra and Martin Place are in step on virus responses
Tuesday’s monetary policy decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia takes official interest rates into new territory. At 0.5 per cent, the cash rate is a whisker away from the unconventional printing-money responses that would signal a full-blown economic and financial emergency. The RBA could not stand in the way of the market herd and the changed sentiment among the globe’s top central bankers as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to wreak havoc on the world economy. It’s an abrupt about-face for RBA governor Philip Lowe, the last optimist standing, a “glass half-full” man in every respect, even after the Black Summer bushfires, drought, US-China trade tensions and the cold-shoulder response of consumers and businesses after three interest rate cuts last year.
Truth be told, the central bank is out of firepower and risks smothering the little confidence there is. Uncertainty reigns in an evolving situation, says the RBA chief, with growth weaker this quarter, and it is “difficult to predict how large and long-lasting the effect will be”. So the anticipated knock-on effects from COVID-19 have the nation’s official family of economic advisers in a huddle to make sure they are fighting the same war. The task is to support spending and employment as the supply-side shock worsens. Budget policy must carry the burden. Scott Morrison is adjusting the dial almost daily on his government’s response as Canberra officials finetune a recovery.
Last week the Prime Minister was calming expectations for a big stimulus, contrasting the Coalition’s approach to Labor’s “extreme” cash splurge to boost liquidity after the global financial crisis. On Thursday, Mr Morrison said Treasury was working up a plan that was “targeted, modest and scalable”. Ahead of the RBA’s move, he said the plan would be “measured” and would focus on jobs, cashflow and investment. Business is being hit by falling demand and supply bottlenecks out of China as the world’s factory shuts down. The tourism and education sectors are the first to be hit, but with confidence slipping and material shortages likely to emerge in coming weeks, the wider economy also will be shaken.No one can yet say whether we are going to see a V-shaped bounce back or a longer, deeper, U-style period of stagnation for national output. But Mr Morrison should be wary of baking into the budget measures that are purely a response to a temporary hit. So far he has been keen to assert COVID-19 is a health crisis, not a financial one. There will be an economic cost, but the challenge is to support only industries and workers in the vortex of the supply crunch. As we have argued for years, a strict fiscal regime in Canberra — with tighter, high-quality spending — delivers lower taxes and is the key to building a viable safety buffer when unexpected events knock us off course. With a budget in balance, a slim current account surplus, robust export prices and solid employment levels, the nation is in reasonable shape to absorb a swift, hard blow. Beyond this macroeconomic challenge, we still need to address a range of supply-side reforms that would make our economy flexible, resilient and more competitive. We need a super-sized, toughened glass that is full.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Dr Phil urges Australia to spend, invest and believe	The Australian	Canberra is watchful, but RBA chief sees better days soon
In his first major address for the year, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe came roaring out of the blocks with an upbeat message to fire up consumers and investors. Perhaps the Morrison government will break out of its defence posture, alert but not alarmed about the economic outlook. Dr Lowe maintained that the central bank’s outlook for GDP growth — 2.75 per cent this year, 3 per cent next year — was achievable. Still, drought, bushfires and the coronavirus outbreak will hold back the recovery from its insipid sub-2 per cent growth over the back half of last year. But markets took the narrow view: the next interest rate cut is further away, so dollar up, bonds down.
Dr Lowe took on critics of the bank’s three cuts in official interest rates last year, which have left the cash rate at a record low 0.75 per cent. To those who say the ultra-low price of money has been a confidence killer for consumers, the RBA chief points to bigger factors at play. Sure, it has unsettled some people, but Australians were already adjusting their spending due to subdued wage growth, a fall in housing prices and high debt levels. In his view, without the easing of monetary policy, household “balance sheet repair” would have been more difficult and the economy would have been weaker. Lower interest rates allowed people to pay down debt faster, plus their asset values were now higher. “It is reasonable to expect that things improve from here,” he said.
Echoing Josh Frydenberg, but with an official’s low-key messaging and technical credibility, Dr Lowe declared the nation’s “economic fundamentals remain very strong and they provide a solid foundation for us to be optimistic about our future”. He then rattled off reasons to be cheerful, parts one through to six: world-class endowments of natural resources; a highly skilled and innovative workforce; an established and predictable regulatory system; sound public finances; a diverse and growing population; and being well placed to benefit from strong growth in Asia, not only China but also populous countries such as Indonesia and India. “We enjoy a set of fundamentals and a standard of living that few other countries enjoy,” he argued. “It’s important that we do not lose sight of this.” Certainly the Treasurer did not resist waving this endorsement of Brand Australia across the chamber in question time on Wednesday. But there was a sting in the tail in Dr Lowe’s speech. “Strong fundamentals, though, can take us only so far,” he said. “If we are to turn these fundamentals into strong and consistent growth, we need to keep investing in our future.” That’s been our consistent message to government, too. As a percentage of GDP, private investment has been on the slide for the past decade, while capital spending in the public sector has been more robust; state governments, especially in NSW and Victoria, have embarked on huge rail and road projects in recent years. Investment is the missing link in our economic story. It is the culprit in our “troubling decline in productivity growth”, says the RBA chief, who nominated a range of areas where fresh capital spending would improve our prospects: infrastructure, human capital, energy production and distribution, new data technology, and measures to deal with climate change and its effects. As well, he says there has never been a better time for companies and governments to contemplate longer-term investments. Why? Because future returns don’t need to be discounted as much (due to entrenched low inflation), financing costs are lower. And they’ll stay that way, as interest rates are likely to be low for some time.So the medium-term task for the Coalition is clear: reforms that help businesses to invest, innovate and skill-up workers. Mr Frydenberg is likely to introduce a tax break for investment in the May budget, a second-best option. We’ve long argued for a lower company tax rate, red-tape reductions, more flexible workplaces and a coherent national energy policy to underpin a revival. It’s the supply side, stupid! The capital’s legislative dysfunction means the business lobby must take whatever it can get, so ad hoc will have to do in the short run. To Canberra’s credit, as Dr Lowe hinted, a balanced budget gives the government the option of a targeted sugar hit to boost consumer or investment spending if the world turns against us. But if Scott Morrison is to make the nation stronger, more secure and resilient to shocks such as the virus outbreak and likely downturn in China, his government will have to aim higher.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Post-pandemic Team Australia	The Australian	Canberra on its own can’t carry a new productivity agenda The pre-pandemic economy is a foreign country. We did things differently there. COVID-19 has stress-tested our institutions and health systems; they held up well, especially in suppressing contagion. But the medical response has taken a toll in job losses, business failures and shattered confidence. As we reanimate commerce in the months ahead, the nation needs to reduce what Scott Morrison sees as a productivity-sapping “sclerosis”. On Tuesday the Prime Minister will sketch out the contours of a long-term economic reform agenda, centred on skills and training. It will also be a pep talk and a refocusing of the national will. Former top bureaucrats and the policy elite have set the test for the political class. In a nutshell, as encapsulated by Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, the nation needs a better set of incentives for businesses “to expand, invest, innovate and hire people”.
Let’s be clear: we are talking about raising productivity and investment, encouraging economic dynamism, leading to profits, jobs and higher living standards. Debates about settings for income support — extending the JobKeeper subsidy or return to normal for JobSeeker — are housekeeping issues, as brutal as unemployment and underemployment are for millions. Remember, before the crisis we were in the wrong lane. Growth was driven by exports (good), public works (mostly good), population (on balance, good) and bigger government (not good). But construction, investment, agriculture and consumer spending were a drag on national output. The government should be able to do both cyclical fiscal policy and long-range structural policy. For many reasons, the latter task has eluded governments for two decades.
Mr Morrison is keen on a new industrial compact between workers, employers, unions and government to boost employment and remodel the economy after the pandemic, as well as a new and more effective federation. Given consensus was Bob Hawke’s operating mode almost 40 years ago, it’s not possible to revisit that foreign country. Yet we must find a way to break Canberra’s dysfunction and reset the problem-solving capability of the bureaucracy, which has been exposed. Mr Morrison wants to harvest fresh ideas, not have logrollers and rent seekers coming in off a few steps, rolling the arm over. Two of the nation’s most respected former public servants, Peter Shergold and Martin Parkinson, have urged the Prime Minister to use the COVID crisis to reverse two decades of over-regulation, which has “gummed up the wheels of commerce”.
We’ve accumulated a lot of gunk in the system through complacency and poor policy. But the political class has been sucked into third-tier cultural skirmishes and indulgent internecine feuds. The will or wit to act on the advice of the Productivity Commission or Ken Henry’s tax review evaporated. As always, the few losers from proposed reform make a lot of noise but the many beneficiaries are spread across the economy. The caravan moves on, election to election, but sound market principles remain, such as getting the right incentives for investment and pricing infrastructure. Or getting rid of disincentives, such as broken workplace rules, high tax rates and deadweight regulation. This focus must not be lost in a populist trading bazaar where the electoral map holds more sway than rational decision-making. We need a game plan to grow the economy, get people back to work and give companies the confidence their capital will get a decent reward for risk-taking. Canberra can’t carry this agenda alone. Indeed, reform of the federation offers as much potential as any other area. The national cabinet has shown up the overly complex machinery of the Council of Australian Governments. A country of 25 million should be able to find a sweet spot between co-operation and competition; the national interest is served by making it easier for people and resources to move where the new opportunities are. Like it or not, post-pandemic Australia will be a different country, trying to rebalance trade, competing on quality and price, moving up the value chain, paying back a mammoth debt, and making sure our young are skilled and engaged in work. Healthy, innovative, ambitious, fleet and sustainable enterprises are the vehicles to take us to that future.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Phasing out wild wet markets	The Australian	Canberra’s case for urgent and decisive action is compelling
Scott Morrison was right to emphasise that his campaign against wildlife wet markets “has never been directed only to one country”. The markets, the Prime Minister said on Wednesday, “exist in many places, just as the next pandemic could come from any country in the world”. That is a grim reality which all 194 World Health Organisation members must recognise as they prepare for next month’s scheduled World Health Assembly. As Amanda Hodge reported on Wednesday, Indonesia’s wildlife wet markets operate under conditions “similar to those in China that have led to the worst pandemic in a century, despite urgent warnings about the risks to human health”. In North Sulawesi’s notorious Tomohon “extreme meat” market, she reported, “rows of bat carcasses were lined up on bloodied butchers’ tables next to charred dog bodies and pig heads. Nearby eviscerated pythons hung suspended from meat hooks while other vendors sold whole cooked rats on sticks.” Such wet markets — like Wuhan’s, where horseshoe bats are believed to have spawned the pandemic — are typical of similar, dangerously unhygienic markets across Southeast Asia and Africa. If ever an Australian leader deserved strong global backing for an initiative, it is surely Mr Morrison’s campaign to get the world to take decisive action over the wet markets. Scientists reportedly believe a staggering 70 per cent of emerging infectious diseases in humans are of zoonotic origin. According to estimates published in The Washington Post, there may be 1.7 million undiscovered viruses in wildlife, with researchers “searching for the ones that could cause the next animal-to-human spillover”, most likely from rodents and bats.
According to Thomas Gillespie, a disease ecologist at Emory University in the US, “bats have a superhero-like immune system that allows them to become reservoirs to many pathogens that do not impact them but can have a tremendous impact on us if they are able to make the jump”. Yet it is bats — slaughtered for their hearts, which are considered good for asthmatics — that are at the epicentre of speculation about the COVID-19 pandemic. They are sold widely in wet markets across Asia and Africa as well as South America. Australian Chief Veterinary Officer Mark Schipp has left no doubt about the global risks the markets pose. “Of the last six pandemics or large-scale emerging diseases since 1980, all have been associated with wild animals,” he pointed out. “(That includes) AIDS, SARS, swine flu, MERS, Ebola and now COVID-19.”Mr Morrison’s case for global action over wet markets wherever they operate could hardly be more compelling. His disclosure of EU president Ursula von der Leyen’s support is vital. So is Agriculture Minister David Littleproud’s lobbying of his G20 counterparts. But with every one of the WHO’s 194 members paying a very high price for the coronavirus, a much wider consensus for decisive global action must be forthcoming. If there isn’t, we may as well all start preparing for the next pandemic.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Invest in the real economy to close indigenous gaps	The Australian	Cape York’s natural advantages have much to offer markets
Years before Kevin Rudd launched the Closing the Gap process in 2008, the need for indigenous people, especially those in remote communities, to overcome welfare dependency and despair through participation in the real economy was clear. The goal was emphasised by the nation’s wisest and most far-sighted indigenous leaders. In supporting their aspiration, The Australian has backed indigenous involvement in mining and workforce programs for Aborigines in major companies, and championed the efforts of Cape York Aborigines to balance development and conservation around their wild rivers, free of heavy-handed state regulation.
In the same spirit, we recognise why Cape York indigenous leaders are backing a $300m Aurukun port proposal that would facilitate bulk ore and live cattle exports. Provided the business case is viable, the facility would help overcome the economic separatism that held back remote Aborigines for too long. Young people need jobs and productive lives, as lawyer Noel Pearson said on Saturday. He dubbed the project a “game changer” for the Wik people and Aurukun. It would differ from previous efforts by governments and companies because it has engaged the traditional owners over development of their lands from the outset.
The proposal is timely. Last week, the 12th Closing the Gap report showed headway in enrolling indigenous four-year-olds in early childhood education and in Year 12 attainment by Aboriginal students. But progress on key measures such as jobs and life expectancy has been disappointing. The national 49 per cent indigenous employment rate compares with 75 per cent for non-indigenous Australians. Lack of jobs in remote regions is a major problem.
As Geoff Chambers wrote on Saturday, resource company Aurum Pacific has launched a scoping study into the port development, which would be capable of handling 12 million tonnes of bauxite a year. The site, Aurum Pacific managing director Scott Dodd said, had a large supply of high-quality bauxite close to deepwater access. The facility also would be ideal for cattle exports. Under ­indigenous land-usage agreements with the Ngan Aak-Kunch Aboriginal Corporation and Cape York Land Council, up to $50m would be injected into the local ­community annually. At least 60 per cent of the workforce would be local people, overcoming the boredom that is a serious problem in remote areas.Scott Morrison, in envisaging a fresh strategy to “close the gap”, has spoken about the need to restore the rights of Aborigines to make decisions, take responsibility and create their own futures. As community leader and NAK chairwoman Barbara Bandicootcha said of the port project: “This is what we want … a start for our people to actually do something with ourselves and for our people and our country.”	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Vale to a timeless, creative spirit	The Australian	Carla Zampatti’s was the quintessential Australian migrant success story. As a child in 1940s Italy, “amid the mountains and sparkling lakes of Lombardy not far from the Swiss border’’, she wrote in her autobiography, she created an imaginary dress shop in the family attic. School and farm work finished for the day, she would sketch her latest creations: “Strange as it may seem, in all that playtime, I never thought of myself as just the dressmaker, mimicking other people’s creations,’’ she wrote in My Life, My Look, released in 2015 to mark the 50th year of her fashion house in Australia. “I was constantly on the lookout for a way to add my special touch to a neckline, hemline or sleeve, making clothes to my own designs, even imagining what it would be like to have my own salon.’’ The “special touches’’ for which Zampatti was appreciated for decades stand out in the distinctive, classic garments on her label’s website, from her current collection. Her death on Saturday, at 78, after a fall at the opening night of the Australian Opera production of La Traviata at Mrs Macquarie’s Point beside Sydney Harbour, is a sudden, devastating blow to her family and a loss for Australia’s fashion industry.
Zampatti was a trailblazer, as fashion editor Glynis Traill-Nash wrote, “starting her business at a time when women were unable to have a bank loan in their own name’’. Like many of the nation’s most successful entrepreneurs, when Zampatti arrived in Australia in 1950 with her family she could not speak English. They settled in Bullfinch, a wheatbelt town in Western Australia. Zampatti later moved to Sydney, launching her first, small collection in 1965. Princesses, politicians and film stars — as well as many women who saved up for a visit to one of her boutiques — were among her legions of fans. The outfits they bought were good value. They lasted, were easy to wear and always looked fresh. Zampatti’s aim was that women should feel comfortable, confident and that what they were wearing represented them at their best. Clients kept some of her pieces for 30 years and still loved wearing them. “No one throws away Carla!” Zampatti once told Vogue. Her contribution to the nation, as Scott Morrison said, “will be timeless, just like her designs”.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
NSW-Victoria border ban is deja flu all over again	The Australian	Chairman Dan inflicts further economic and social damage More than 100 years ago, NSW unilaterally closed the border with Victoria. It was January 1919, during the Spanish influenza pandemic, and a soldier who had arrived in Sydney by train from Melbourne was diagnosed with pneumonic influenza. After he infected staff, patients and visitors at a military hospital, NSW officials closed the border without warning. People were stranded on both sides, quarantine tent camps were erected; the marooned had to rely on charities. More closures followed and Canberra, in charge of maritime quarantine to keep the virus at bay, threw up its hands, leaving it to warring states to sort out the messy border details. It’s deja flu all over again.
The abrupt decision on Monday by NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian to close the border with Victoria from Tuesday midnight was based on advice from her state’s Chief HealthOfficer. The game had changed. “We’re hoping this is a temporary arrangement. I want to see this happen for the shortest time possible,” Ms Berejiklian said. The decision was taken because of the escalation in infections in Melbourne during the past week and fears the virus was spreading through the community. The daily number of new infections in the state hit a record 127. NSW officials are concerned COVID-19 cases will now spread beyond Melbourne. Yet for months Ms Berejiklian strongly had urged all states and territories to open their borders to interstate travel.
The closure of the NSW-Victoria border will stall economic recovery, disrupt supply chains and lead to job losses. It also will set back community confidence about the approach officials are taking. On Monday, the NSW Premier was working both sides of the border issue. She denied the new ban was in conflict with earlier calls to reopen elsewhere. “What is occurring in Victoria is not happening anywhere else in Australia. It requires a new type of response,” she said. Ms Berejiklian is right, up to a point. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has botched his policy and it requires others to step up to limit the fallout. His approach is part hubris, part incompetence, but the end result is telltale authoritarian Chairman Dan. His rhetoric throughout the crisis has been overegged, the responses veering to overkill. Yet even failure, such as the latest spike in cases, comes with “I told you so”. In this rigged game of spin and win, Mr Andrews can never be wrong.
As Greg Sheridan explained on Monday, Mr Andrews’s failure is broad and both political and technocratic. Perhaps his most shocking ploy was putting untrained security guards into high-stress, technically demanding roles managing distressed people in hotel quarantine, Sheridan wrote. All the way through this crisis, Mr Andrews has spoken in melodramatic terms about the life-and-death consequences of everyday decisions: if you go out shopping, people will die. Or “playing golf is not worth someone’s life”. Well, who can argue with that? Mr Andrews pulled the trigger on naming a school linked to an inactive case when it suited him to justify school closures. But he was awfully discreet about identifying the Cedar Meats abattoir, the site of a significant outbreak and, at best, half-hearted in warning people not to attend the Black Lives Matter demonstrations.
As the Big Man who greedily banks applause and the high personal ratings from a besieged citizenry, Mr Andrews is culpable for these errors. And now the entire country is dealing with the grim consequences. Scott Morrison has warned the last thing we want is a “go, stop, go, stop” rhythm to reopening the economy. It will kill confidence and confuse the public. Australia’s strategy has never been to eradicate COVID-19. Rather, the aim has been to suppress the rate of infection while building up the supply of medical tools and bedding down processes to deal with outbreaks. We’ve boosted supplies of masks, respirators and intensive-care hospital beds; ramped up testing across the nation; put in place an app-based contact-tracing regime to take pressure off the experts. As long as we operate in a COVID-safe way, in business and in social life, we can get people back to work, earning and spending money, and taking the weight off taxpayers. The Melbourne outbreaks were avoidable and deeply regrettable, and are a reminder of the need for strong leadership and common sense. Sure, closing the border may stop Victorians hitting the road to head north. Yet a sense of proportion is also required. Australia has been successful in fighting COVID-19. Of 8380 cases, three in five came from overseas. Sadly, 106 people have died. But the mortality rate for infected people aged under 70 is below 0.1 per cent. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd says Victoria’s outbreak is a reminder that “we are all at risk from a resurgence”. Still, we need to be both vigilant and measured in our behaviour. Community welfare is a broad measure of health, social and economic outcomes. A spike in community transmission, serious as it is, should not be an excuse to hide under the doona this winter or impose more draconian restrictions. We run the risk of losing the many gains we have made, while ignoring the lessons we’ve learned about living with the virus, being resilient and adapting to our vexed, if temporary, circumstances.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Fiscal prudence and reward for effort are always in style	The Australian	Challenges of the GFC and the pandemic are not the same Given the high level of debt-funded spending contained in the federal budget, it has become fashionable to declare that we are all Keynesian economists now. ABC television presenter Leigh Sales went so far as to suggest the budget measures had shown the federal government was “dishonest and cynical” in its attacks on Labor’s response to the global financial crisis. This view reflects lazy thinking and partial knowledge rather than objective understanding. The budget does share some attributes of Keynesian economic theory in which government spending is used to boost demand during a downturn. But the conditions that flow from the pandemic are not easily compared to those of the global financial crisis. Just as the budget response outlined by Josh Frydenberg is far removed from the measures unleashed by the Rudd government with, in the case of the home insulation scheme, sometimes deadly results.
The Treasurer says the central aim of the budget is to build a bridge to the other side of the COVID-19 crisis and begin the recovery phase. He argues that comparisons with the GFC do not do justice to the scale of the financial predicament now being faced. During the GFC the global economy contracted by 0.1 per cent. This compares with OECD forecasts for the pandemic to cut the global economy this year by 4.5 per cent. Australia has performed relatively well compared with economies such as Britain and the US. Nonetheless, gross domestic product has fallen by 7 per cent in the June quarter and Australia’s net debt to GDP is forecast to peak at 44 per cent. Under the budget forecasts, the deficit will reach $213.7bn this year with net debt rising to $703bn.
The government has responded to the pandemic with measures focused on promoting jobs growth and assisting businesses to invest. Mr Frydenberg says the government’s fiscal strategy is in two parts, with spending front-end loaded. More than 90 per cent of the money being spent as part of the response will be spent across two years. It is an emergency response aimed at keeping the economy alive and creating jobs until a clearer picture can emerge on the big questions hanging over the global and national economic outlook. This includes the prospect and timing of a vaccine being developed and deployed to combat the coronavirus. This in turn will determine the speed with which international travel can resume, something vital to restoring tourism and aviation businesses badly hit by the pandemic.
The end of travel restrictions also will restore the possibility that migrants will want to call Australia home. Immigration helped to shield Australia from recession during the past few decades. Rising numbers of immigrants have provided a foundation for activity in the building sector and supported rising house prices, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, which has flowed out nationally. Without a return to high immigration, Australia’s economic outlook is vastly different.
Immediate criticisms of the budget have been that not enough was spent on infrastructure projects and that it lacked big-ticket reforms in areas such as industrial relations. One response has been that the Morrison government’s focus has been on restoring stability so bigger reform issues can be tackled in the future. It remains to be seen whether the electoral cycle will afford the government such luxury. There are sure to be some unintended consequences from the budget, including from prioritising job support measures based on employees’ age. Mr Frydenberg says integrity test measures have been included to protect existing workers. But he says the big lesson from past recessions has been that young workers who struggle to enter the workforce face long-term disadvantage.
Unlike Labor’s response to the GFC, stimulus measures announced this week do not include wasteful spending on things such as school infrastructure that, while in some cases justified, carried over for years after the crisis had passed. Instead, this budget brings forward already announced personal tax cuts and introduces short-term employment grants. Businesses have been given access to accelerated depreciation and investment write-offs to help build resilience and capacity for the future.
If there is a common lesson from the GFC and the pandemic it is that a strong budget provides policy options. When the GFC hit, the ALP was able to draw on the budget strength left by the Howard-Costello years. The Reserve Bank was able to play its part by cutting interest rates by 425 basis points to stimulate economic activity. Mr Frydenberg says this had the same impact as pumping $100bn stimulus effectively into the economy across 12 months. When COVID-19 hit, Mr Frydenberg also had the good fortune of being able to respond with a budget near surplus thanks to years of restraint to rein in deficits. In this case, however, the low interest rate environment made it impossible for the Reserve Bank to respond in the way it had during the GFC. The reverse side of already low interest rates is the government has greater capacity to borrow to help provide the emergency measures aimed at boosting business confidence and employment. The challenge ahead is to reduce unemployment, to get the economy firing and to maintain a focus on one day reducing debt to build a solid foundation from which to respond to shocks when they arise. The pandemic is not an excuse to justify open-ended or wasteful spending. Neither is it a reason to believe that fashionable ideas such as modern monetary theory hold a promise of a new economic paradigm as some suggest. The budget has its flaws but is a sensible document rooted in the principles of fiscal prudence and reward for effort.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Green bank confused about aim	The Australian	Cheap wind and solar technology don’t need further government help
Australia’s $10bn green bank experiment, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, comes complete with all of the distortions and compromises that illustrate why picking business winners is no place for government. Conceived by the Gillard Labor-Greens alliance in 2012, the CEFC was established to provide finance for renewable energy projects when backers were hard to find. The concept was that a pool of government funds could help take risk out of investments to make them a safer proposition for more traditional lenders.
The Abbott government pledged to abandon the project but couldn’t, so it restricted the CEFC lending mandate. The Turnbull government relaxed the lending rules to allow the CEFC to resume support for mature technologies as well as some emerging favourites. The Morrison government has expanded the investment remit further to include new technologies including carbon capture, gas and recycling.
The result has been confusion on the part of the CEFC as to what exactly its true focus should be. This conflict is expressed in an audit of the CEFC’s lending performance and response from the corporation. The Australian National Audit Office found the CEFC has never met its government-mandated benchmarks for investment returns and has no strategy to do so within the next decade. The CEFC is expected to make a return on funds of 5-6 per cent but it has achieved a seven-year rate of 4.75 per cent, with investments in its Innovation Fund losing up to 27.1 per cent in one year. CEFC chairman Steven Skala responded to the audit report by rejecting the view that the CEFC should be guided by profit in all of its investments. The CEFC says while it operates with an objective of financial sustainability, profit maximising is not its primary objective. Mr Skala says the CEFC primarily invests for a public policy purpose.
Abandonment of investment norms appears to be a trait shared by many renewable energy enthusiasts, particularly when it is government money at stake. For industry participants, the problem is not that the CEFC does not meet its performance benchmarks but that those benchmarks are too high. Rather than 6 per cent, a performance rate of 0.25 per cent has been suggested. The real problem has been identified by Grattan Institute analyst Tony Wood: the CEFC is conflicted because it is neither fish nor fowl. It is a financial institution freelancing as a venture capitalist with modest expectations.
The CEFC claims its government-backed investment of $8.2bn has unlocked leveraged commitments of $24.3bn since 2012. The audit report says this figure includes projects that would have gone ahead without the CEFC’s support. In these cases, the CEFC is unfairly competing with the private sector or providing a government subsidy to other lenders that do not require it. There certainly may be a role for government in supporting new technologies but it is reasonable to ask if the CEFC is the best approach. Given that mature technologies such as wind and solar photovoltaic are now regarded as the cheapest available option there is no obvious reason for continued government support. Government support for emerging but non-profitable new technologies is already provided by the CEFC’s sister organisation, the grant-focused Australian Renewable Energy Agency. ARENA says that since 2012 it has supported 566 projects with $1.63bn in grant funding, unlocking a total investment of almost $6.69bn in Australia’s renewable energy industry. The CEFC is another step along the chain but the audit report shows it is operating in areas where it is not needed and it is conflicted in supporting new technologies that prevent it from meeting its mandated return on public funds. The answer is not to lower the bar of expectations in terms of financial performance. Ultimately, the level, cost and benefit of public good provided by the CEFC must be expressed more clearly. Britain resolved the issue by privatising its Green Investment Bank and selling it to Macquarie Bank. This is an example the Morrison government would be wise to consider.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Defunding police a crazy move	The Australian	Chicago killings show how vulnerable minorities would be
After George Floyd’s killing, there can be no doubt about the need for effective police reform in America, particularly when it comes to the all-too-often brutal behaviour of individual officers. But the growing clamour by the Black Lives Matter movement and so-called progressives to defund the police and replace them with what would be akin to warrior-turned-guardian social workers could hardly be wider of the mark in a country perennially scarred by violent crime, much of it targeted at or otherwise involving black Americans. With the slogan painted in large letters on a major road leading to the White House, and being chanted at protest rallies nationwide, it is no wonder Donald Trump has seized on it. He is using it to back his argument that his opponents in what appears certain to be November’s law-and-order election “have gone crazy”.
A detailed account in the Chicago Sun-Times of what happened in just one day in the US’s third-largest city shows the challenge police face and why defunding them would be a disaster. On May 31, 18 people were murdered, making it Chicago’s most violent 24 hours since records began 60 years ago. Over the weekend beginning at 7pm Friday and ending at 11pm Sunday, 85 people were shot, 24 fatally, as rioters went on a rampage and gangs exploited the vulnerabilities of the overstretched police force to steal and kill. “We’ve never seen anything like it,” said Max Kapustin, research director at the University of Chicago Crime Lab. “I don’t even know how to put it into context. It’s beyond anything we’ve ever seen before.” The victims included the 32-year-old father of three young children caught in crossfire paying his phone bill, a 36-year-old father of two killed in a drive-by shooting, a 30-year-old black woman standing innocently on her verandah, senselessly shot by a passer-by, and an 18-year-old studying to become a prison officer who wrote a paper last year about gun violence in her neighbourhood. Chicago’s emergency services received 65,000 calls for help on the day — 50,000 more than usual. Police had to work overtime but were stretched thin amid extensive and indiscriminate attacks mainly in low-income black neighbourhoods.
But it is not just in Chicago that American police are overstretched. In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed and the city council now wants to “dismantle” the police force, carjackings this year are up 45 per cent, homicides 60 per cent, arson 58 per cent, and burglaries 28 per cent. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey was booed off the stage by a crowd of BLM protesters last weekend when he admitted he opposed defunding. In New York City, shootings are up 18 per cent so far this year, burglaries 31 per cent and carjackings 64 per cent. The trend is the same on America’s west coast, with crime surging in places such as San Francisco. But Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti is moving to redirect $US150m ($216m) from public safety to social programs. Paradoxically, while the “defund the police” calls are gaining momentum, polls show only 16 per cent of all Americans, and 33 per cent of African-Americans, support the demand. No wonder Mr Trump appears confident that, despite being behind his Democrat challenger Joe Biden in most polls (by an average of seven percentage points, but by as much as 14 points in some), he can make up ground by running on law and order and win in November. The precedent he has in mind is doubtless Republican Richard Nixon’s victory against Democrat Hubert Humphrey in 1968 after running a law-and-order campaign amid the mass civil unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King. Bad police must be brought to book and punished. But the lesson of violent crime and death in Chicago and other American cities is that bowing to the defunding clamour would be a mistake. Amid the disorder, police are vital, especially for the protection of vulnerable minority communities.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Smug premiers eat humble pie	The Australian	Childish rivalry between states over COVID-19 is damaging Three weeks ago, when NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian noted that state border closures were undermining the national economy, she drew a barrage of flak from her more parochial interstate counterparts. Queensland’s Annastacia Palaszczuk and Western Australia’s Mark McGowan were insufferably smug. Queensland, Ms Palaszczuk said, was “not going to be lectured to by a state that has the highest number of (COVID-19) cases in Australia”. In her schoolmarmish tone she told “NSW and Victoria, get your cases under control so we can open the borders up”. Her Deputy Premier and Health Minister, Steven Miles, was condescending: “We know Sydney can be dreary but hang in there.” Mr McGowan accused Ms Berejiklian of bullying: “NSW had the Ruby Princess — I mean, seriously? And they are trying to give us advice on our borders, seriously?” WA’s isolation was its “greatest strength”, he claimed. Businesses struggling to stay afloat and unemployed staff ardently disagree.
The Labor leaders spoke as though their states were immune from errors, amid an unpredictable pandemic where small slips trigger major repercussions. As they have in Queensland and WA.
On Tuesday, Mr Miles apologised to the partner and family of Blackwater miner Nathan Turner after the state coroner concluded the 30-year-old did not have coronavirus when he died a week ago. The circumstances had compounded the grief of Mr Turner’s loved ones, he conceded. As Michael McKenna has reported, a test conducted several hours after Mr Turner’s death produced a positive reading for COVID-19. But a second test three hours later came back negative. And the fraught confusion has become messier by Queensland Health’s handling of investigations into whether a Rockhampton nurse, who tested positive for the virus, was the source of Mr Turner’s infection. Exasperated health officials say the woman’s story “has changed so many times”. The Nurses Professional Association of Queensland claims she is the victim of a government witch hunt. The nurse sparked a crisis a fortnight ago at an aged-care home where she continued working after being tested for COVID-19. WA is also on the back foot. It failed to act on an email warning about three sick crew on board the Al Kuwait sheep ship before it berthed in Fremantle port on May 22. Of its 48 crew, 21 have become infected and account for most of the state’s cases. As Mr McGowan conceded, the email “plainly” should have raised red flags within the WA Department of Health. The pressure and stress of the past few months, he said, might have taken its toll. Exactly — as it has in all states — which is why personal slanging matches by state leaders should have no place in the current situation. Further apologies could be in order, however, after the economic and social costs of states wallowing in isolation — against federal medical advice — emerge.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Clock ticking on gender clinics	The Australian	Children and teenagers can be deemed competent to consent to medical treatment without parental approval under the common law Gillick rule. With minimal court supervision, that rule applies to life-altering medical treatments for under-18s in children’s hospital transgender clinics. In England, use of the Gillick rule in gender clinics faces a challenge, with a High Court judge granting a full hearing for a “plainly arguable” case that minors cannot give informed consent to treatments such as puberty blockers with unknown long-term risks. That challenge is relevant to Australia, and similar litigation here is inevitable. The same hormone drugs used in Australia are being scrutinised for safety and evidence by international experts and research groups.
This means policy-makers in Australia cannot indefinitely operate in a vacuum with little transparency. On Friday, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt sent the gender clinic controversy back to the states via a COAG health officials council, urging them to come up with consistent and safe clinical standards for their children’s hospital clinics. Amid uncertainty about his reasons, Mr Hunt ruled out a national inquiry, which would put this child welfare issue in the public spotlight.The states have a chance to preside over a thorough and independent review. But there are grounds for scepticism. Victoria is the key state, having lobbied for the contentious “gender-affirmative” treatment model with easier access to irreversible hormone drugs and under-18 surgery. So far, the Andrews government and its Royal Children’s Hospital gender clinic have refused to engage with informed critics. And the COAG review starts not with a blank slate but with questionable advice from a medical college that had promoted the affirmative treatments it was later called upon to assess. That advice focused on the “harm” done by media coverage of this health debate, not the harm that might be done by treatments it admits are based on patchy evidence. The information and expertise for a rigorous COAG review are available. It’s up to state ministers — and Mr Hunt as Australia’s health minister — to supply the essential integrity and determination.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Countering United Front’s meddling, spying and theft	The Australian	China Inc is exploiting our open society for political warfare
Launching an overhaul of foreign investment screening, Scott Morrison said geopolitics meant deals could not rest on commercial aspects alone. Instead, they would also be judged on strategic and national security issues. From next year, all foreign proposals relating to sensitive businesses — telecommunications, critical infrastructure, defence supply chain, cyber-related technology, businesses that collect, store and own data, aspects of energy, electricity, ports and water — will go before the Foreign Investment Review Board. The buck stops with the Treasurer, who will be able to “call in” an investment — before, during or after acquisition — for a security review. “Investment in Australia must be on our terms, on our rules and in our interests,” the Prime Minister said, invoking sovereignty, the pandemic’s critical institutional bequest. Yet this is not a kneejerk response in a crisis but the result of China Inc’s pathologies.
Beijing’s use of financial muscle and political warfare to expose weak points in our open society is driving change. As security analyst Alan Dupont has noted, under President Xi Jinping, China’s “expanding toolkit” includes propaganda, “wolf warrior” diplomacy, disinformation, media manipulation, subversion, financial traps, intellectual property theft, coercion and the use of economic and military pressure for strategic purposes. “Xi has elevated interference and influence operations into an art form,” Dupont argued in our pages. The Chinese Communist Party’s tactics have forced responses, including foreign interference and espionage laws, the banning of Huawei from the new 5G network and curbs on foreign donations to political parties. ASIO director-general Mike Burgess believes the level of threat from espionage and interference is unprecedented. “It is higher now than it was at the height of the Cold War,” he said in February.
Now, a new research paper by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute documents the CCP’s United Front system to influence politicians, meddle in Chinese communities and transfer technologies from abroad. ASPI’s Alex Joske details how the model, which has been used in China to quash civil society and independent voices, is being exported to foreign political parties, diaspora communities, universities and multinational corporations. The system undermines social cohesion, fuels racial tension, influences politics, harms media integrity, facilitates espionage and increases unsupervised technology transfer. As we have reported in recent weeks, the vast network operates here in various guises, with groups involved in technology transfer, talent recruitment and facilitating deals. ASPI’s report is a reality check, detailing how China’s intelligence agencies, universities, state-owned media, state-owned enterprises, private companies and foreign affairs agencies are part of a disruptive system. If we are to counteract the CCP’s onslaught, we need to understand its structures, agencies, methods and effects. It won’t be easy to get a clear view, for example, given how deeply enmeshed research institutes are with China’s in key fields, including computing, marine science and medicine. We are dealing with an authoritarian, opaque regime, playing by its own rules. When we assert our interests, as in investment screening, there will be retaliation, such as tariffs on our products and travel warnings against visiting Australia, and lost opportunities. According to a report by KPMG and the University of Sydney, Chinese investment in Australia fell by more than 60 per cent last year, despite a record level of bilateral trade. We know doing business with China Inc can be mutually beneficial. But we must also become resilient to punishment in standing up for principles and values.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Mockery made of human rights	The Australian	China and Russia only reveal their anxiety about international norms
First Russia and now China have targeted Australia over the undeniably serious allegations of the Brereton report that our special forces were responsible for the murder of 39 Afghan citizens and prisoners. “This is a truly shocking report,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, also has expressed his ostensible shock, tweeting a fake photo — supposed to represent an Australian special forces soldier slaughtering a child — with the mocking caption: “Don’t be afraid, we are coming to bring you peace.” This is propaganda on both counts. It is part of a power struggle, but the theatre of conflict is not Afghanistan. In a sense, the true target is not even Australia but the civilised international norms to which we subscribe — and, yes, sometimes fall short of.
Hypocrisy is the key word. Last week Mr Zhao seized on the Brereton report and said it pointed to “the hypocrisy of some Western countries who like to consider themselves as guardians of human rights and freedom”. All those around the world who have been following the fate of Hong Kong’s democracy activists and the incarcerated Uighurs in mainland China — and all those who fear for the freedom of Taiwan — know exactly why the Chinese Communist Party would like people to believe that universal aspirations of freedom and humanity are rendered hollow by shameful actions. The truth is the opposite, in the same way that nothing is a better reminder of the need to be vigilant and to maintain the rule of law than outbreaks of law-breaking or corruption.
It’s significant that Ms Zakharova said “the circumstances (of the Brereton report allegations) make us truly doubt the genuine capacity of Australian authorities to actually hold accountable all the servicemen who are guilty of such crimes”. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is notorious for the impunity enjoyed by organised crime, official corruption and, so it is alleged, state-sanctioned murder. In October Russia withdrew from talks with Australia and The Netherlands over the long-frustrated attempt to bring accountability to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014 by a Russian-made missile fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels. All those on board died, among them 38 Australians.
In stark contrast to Russia’s obfuscation, Australia’s authorities appear to have been open and meticulous in acting on reports from whistleblower soldiers about alleged crimes in Afghanistan. The Brereton report runs to almost 500 pages, represents a serious attempt to find the truth, however the cards may fall, and there is no credible suggestion of any official attempt to sabotage it. And that is how it should be. If the lives of Afghan people have been taken unlawfully, then there must be a reckoning, otherwise it would indeed call into question the principles of justice that Australians hold dear — and which are part of the reason many ethnic Chinese have felt the global pull of migration to our open society. Indeed, if there is a criticism of Australia’s response to the Brereton report, it’s growing unease about the suggestion that 3000 special forces soldiers — or, in some instances, their bereaved families — ought to be stripped of their meritorious service awards as a form of collective dishonour. The overwhelming majority of these soldiers face no allegations at all and are heroes to whom we should acknowledge an enduring debt. And these soldiers are not alone in observing that the top brass get to keep their medals. This potential unfairness should be more carefully considered so it does not become a distraction from the central issue: the alleged conduct of a few and the imperative to make amends. It’s the calibre of our response to this moral test — not transparent propaganda and misdirection by authoritarians with an agenda — that will determine the effect on our reputation in the world. Both Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are quick to speak of the honour of their regimes and the respect to which they are entitled. Fear can be commanded and dissent can be muffled, but respect is only corroded by propaganda.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Duterte risks regional security	The Australian	China will gain if The Philippines scraps its pact with the US
With much at stake for The Philippines and its regional partners, including Australia, President Rodrigo Duterte should rethink his risky decision to scrap the key security pact that has long underpinned the US alliance with Manila. Abrogation of the 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement, as US Defence Secretary Mark Esper warned, would be a gift to China as it flexes its muscle in the South China Sea and seeks to displace the US as the region’s dominant power. Scrapping the pact also would be a blow to the fight against Islamic State-linked terrorism. In 2017, the US played a crucial role in ending the embarrassing (for Manila) five-month takeover by jihadists of the city of Marawi on the island of Mindanao.
The mercurial Mr Duterte’s determination to “end that son of a bitch”, as he described the VFA, has been under consideration for some time. The immediate cause was his fury over the US’s revocation of a visa granted to Ronald dela Rosa, the former national police chief, who is a senator and friend of Mr Duterte. Senator dela Rosa supervised the President’s crackdown on the drugs trade in which hundreds of alleged dealers were killed, along with innocent bystanders and children. Mr Duterte believes the US disapproved of the campaign. But he should heed the views of some in his cabinet. Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin warned “terminating the VFA will negatively impact our defence and security … our contribution to our regional defence is anchored in our military alliance with the world’s last superpower”. Scrapping the VFA would jeopardise US help. The Philippines accepted $US550m from Washington between 2016 and last year. The VFA facilitates movement of US troops and equipment. It is regarded by military chiefs as a precondition for US military presence in the country. Australia is the only other country to have a VFA with The Philippines, under which soldiers have been trained for the fight against terror. Philippines officials say scrapping the US VFA will not affect the Australian agreement.The 180-day notice of withdrawal announced by Mr Duterte was the culmination of years of anti-American statements. In Beijing in 2016 Mr Duterte declared “goodbye” to more than six decades of co-operation. Since then he has drawn closer to Beijing, despite China’s claims to the Scarborough Shoal, an outcrop of rocks and reefs 350km from Manila. China has not militarised the shoal but reportedly wants to do so. Announcing Mr Duterte’s decision, a spokesman said “we will rely on ourselves … we will strengthen our own defences”. The inability of The Philippines to end the jihadist takeover of Marawi shows that is far from reality. Philippines congress members want to thwart Mr Duterte’s move. It is in their interests, and that of the region, that they succeed.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Killing Hong Kong’s autonomy	The Australian	China’s crushing of the territory will extract a high price Washington’s declaration that Hong Kong no longer enjoys a “high degree” of autonomy from China points to the likely economic impact of Beijing trampling over the territory’s prized democratic freedoms. The formal announcement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo opens the way for Donald Trump to impose sanctions that could destroy Hong Kong’s position as a global business hub and the preferred base of many US and other Western companies as their gateway to the wider China market.
Hong Kong has long operated as one of the freest and most successful economies in the world, even in the 23 years since Beijing took control after committing itself to the “one country, two systems” model that enshrined autonomy until 2047. Endorsement by the US and other nations of the territory’s special status served as a seal of approval for the city’s business role. That was backed by an efficient and respected Western-style court system and the rule of law. The system was the basis for the remarkable economic success enjoyed by Hong Kong’s 7.5 million people and was a useful link to mainland China between East and West. That status is under immediate threat of being extinguished as Chinese Communist Party delegates rubber-stamp President Xi Jinping’s dictatorial security laws. These are targeted at what the CCP brands as Hong Kong’s “terrorist” democracy movement.
Mr Xi and his handmaid in Hong Kong, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, are deluding themselves if they dismiss the overwhelming support enjoyed by the democracy movement in the territory. Nor will the draconian new regime, in whatever form it takes, diminish the Hong Kong people’s overwhelming support for democracy. After declaring himself president for life, Mr Xi is frustrated over his inability to impose his will on Hong Kong. His predecessors since the 1997 handover, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, recognised the value to China of Hong Kong as a financial hub and entry point. They also understood the reputational and financial damage that would be done if the “one country, two systems” model was abandoned. They did not interfere. Mr Xi appears to have different priorities. His warning to the CCP congress that “it is necessary to step up preparations for armed combat” is resonating, especially in Taiwan but also in India and farther afield.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Nation on coronavirus alert	The Australian	China’s disclosure that the new coronavirus discovered in Wuhan can be spread through human-to-human contact adds urgency to the need to prevent it from reaching our shores. A Brisbane man returning from China was placed in quarantine but deemed on Tuesday not to be a public risk.
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy’s announcement that passengers on the three direct flights from Wuhan to Sydney each week will be subjected to triple health checks is a sensible start. With 160 flights landing in Australia each week from China, and authorities revealing the severe acute respiratory syndrome-type pathogen has spread from Wuhan to Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen since December 31, vigilance is essential.
Cases also have been reported in Japan, Thailand and South Korea, all involving travellers from Wuhan, where the fish and meat market is the outbreak’s epicentre. Qualifying rounds for the 2020 Olympic women’s football tournament are to be held in Wuhan, with Australia’s Matildas to play on February 3, 6 and 9. At this stage Chinese authorities say they have no intention to move the tournament, a decision that should be reviewed.Chinese figures put the number of people infected at 218, with four deaths. But researchers at Imperial College London suspect the number infected could be as high as 1700. About 700 people died and 8000 were infected in the 2002-03 SARS outbreak. With the World Health Organisation meeting to consider declaring an international emergency, the full extent of the outbreak is likely to emerge from Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations starting on Saturday. With an estimated 400 million people leaving Chinese cities to visit their families for the holiday, there are fears that, as with SARS in 2002, the mass migration could accelerate the virus’s spread.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Huawei dials up security risks	The Australian	China’s global offensive on 5G is insidious and destabilising
China’s ambassador Cheng Jingye was dead right when he labelled Canberra’s ban on Huawei from a role in our 5G network “discrimination”. We take the word to mean good judgment rather than racial profiling. The 2018 decision by the Turnbull government was based on an assessment by security agencies that the Chinese tech giant was a “high-risk vendor”. As current ASIO director-general Mike Burgess, then Australian Signals Directorate chief, said at the time, the nature of 5G — which will underpin driverless cars and water and power supply — is that “a potential threat anywhere in the network is a threat to the whole network”. It’s difficult to think of anything more important than getting national security right for vital infrastructure or maintaining the circle of trust among those with whom we share critical intelligence in the Five Eyes alliance.
Huawei is now hitting the road on a charm offensive around Australia, arguing for a “fair go”. There’s no doubt the company is welcome here; through many years it has invested billions and employed thousands of people. But it is a state-run entity, a strategic tool of the Chinese Communist Party. We wonder how far an Australian or US company would get asking to be part of the rollout of a strategic network in China. Or consider the newish Chinese embassy in Canberra; a decade ago Beijing extracted a deal from Kevin Rudd allowing China to ship in a team of workers on diplomatic visas to build the embassy. That did not go down well with the comrades at the construction union. In any case, the 5G ship has sailed so the company should save its PR dollars. There is no political appetite on either side of politics for a change.
Mr Cheng’s opportunism is a result of Britain’s appalling decision to allow Huawei to build its 5G and full-fibre network, albeit with a limit of 35 per cent of “non-core” parts of the project. Former prime minister Tony Abbott said Boris Johnson’s move was a serious error and he hoped the British Prime Minister would eventually cut Huawei completely out of its 5G market. It’s a message Labor’s Anthony Byrne, deputy chairman of parliament’s intelligence committee, delivered to British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab when Mr Raab visited Canberra.
That’s what friends do, especially as any damage to Britain’s security is a threat to our interests. As Greg Sheridan explained on Monday, it’s not only, or even primarily, eavesdropping that is the risk. In any serious disagreement with China, Beijing would have the capacity to damage or disable British infrastructure. Plus the 5G decision gravely injures the geostrategic task of Britain’s allies in resisting Huawei’s rising influence. China is winning the 5G technology race via a mix of theft, innovation, subsidies and coercion. Sheridan said Britain’s move made it harder for Western allies to make sure there were viable alternatives to Huawei. Closing the technology gap has to be more creative than blocking Huawei.Still, Donald Trump is upping the pressure on Mr Johnson and Germany’s Angela Merkel, who is now considering her options on Huawei. US envoy to Germany Richard Grenell said Mr Trump told him to “make clear that any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardise our ability to share intelligence and information at the highest level”. The US President could not be more clear about the risks to NATO, looming trade deals and the future of Five Eyes. Mr Johnson and Mrs Merkel should heed the 5G advice of their longstanding security partners.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Virus hits students and tourists	The Australian	China’s troubles are a reminder that benefits come with risk
The scale of threat from the latest coronavirus originating in China is a rapidly unfolding story. Almost 3000 infections have been declared in mainland China and it has spread elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific, including Australia, as well as to Europe and the US. It appears those without symptoms can pass on the virus. China’s Health Minister, Ma Xiaowei, has suggested it is becoming more infectious, although it’s not yet clear how easy it is to catch or what proportion of patients may die. In any event, it’s already serious enough to reflect on medium-term implications while keeping in mind this is unlikely to be the last such virus to emerge from China’s wildlife markets.
The rise of China has been a marvel of the modern world; never before have so many people been lifted out of abject poverty so quickly. This has helped drive prosperity for many other nations, not least Australia, which was spared the hardship of the global financial crisis thanks to the China trade. As the Chinese middle class expanded, travel overseas for business and education became normalised. Australia alone has more than 35 direct inbound flights from China daily. This interchange, easily taken for granted, promotes personal ties and mutual understanding that can help mitigate future tensions between China and the rest of the world. But no benefit comes without its risks.
Already singed by bushfire, our tourist industry is bracing for a sizeable loss of revenue following China’s decision to cancel outbound group travel bookings. In a rapidly expanding market, Chinese visitors to Australia spend almost $12bn a year. Of course, the damage to China’s own economy has been highlighted by the virus outbreak, and travel restrictions have cast a pall over the Lunar New Year holiday, when millions of families reunite for celebration and feasting. This disruption is close to home for us because more than 1.2 million Australians are ethnic Chinese.
As retail spending and commercial activity weaken in China, there will be economic knock-on effects for the rest of the world, depending on how prolonged this health crisis turns out to be. Australia’s universities have a special vulnerability. They are large-scale, successful recruiters of other countries’ students, trading on our reputation as a safe, naturally beautiful destination. But images of bushfire inferno have gone around the world. On top of this, our universities are heavily reliant on tuition fees from one overseas nation: China. This was the source of more than a quarter of revenue for the University of Sydney and the University of NSW in 2018.Just as tourism marketing has to keep developing new markets, so too our higher education sector has to make a better fist of diversifying the source countries of international students. And China’s troubles should be a general wake-up call for our political class. Red tape and other burdens on business need to be lifted so we can unleash the entrepreneurial spirits necessary to come up with new products, services and markets, thereby diversifying our sources of prosperity.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Myanmar’s civilian killings rise	The Australian	Chinese and Russian support is crucial to the nation’s ruling junta The Myanmar army’s massacre on Saturday of what is believed to be well over 100 unarmed civilians underlines the need for urgent international action to halt the unrelenting bloodbath being perpetrated by the generals. Scenes of appalling depravity were witnessed in more than 40 towns and villages as soldiers ruthlessly gave effect to a warning that pro-democracy protesters on so-called Army Day would be shot on sight “in the head and back”. In the worst day of killing since the military overturned the country’s democratic hopes and seized total power on February 1, women and children were among those targeted by the junta’s “shoot to kill” order, aimed even at civilians trying to escape the violence. Harrowing images showed parents clutching the bodies of lifeless children, among them a five-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl. US ambassador Thomas Vajda condemned the “ horrifying bloodbath”, while the EU’s delegation described Army Day as one of “terror and dishonour” for Myanmar’s 55 million people.
Yet there was not the slightest hint of regret from junta strongman General Min Aung Hlaing. As the killing was going on, he celebrated a display of the military’s strength at a large parade in the capital, Naypyidaw, and the highly significant attendance at the parade of one of Vladimir Putin’s top generals, as well as representatives of China and other regional nations. That support from Russia and China goes to the heart of the challenge Western and regional democracies face as horrifying developments unfold in Myanmar. The US and UK have provided a strong lead in the crisis, as Amanda Hodge wrote on Saturday. They have announced punitive sanctions targeting the military-owned companies that enrich Myanmar’s generals. Canada and New Zealand have also imposed stringent sanctions. Australia, as Hodge wrote, is under pressure from human rights groups and corporate activists to impose similar measures targeted at the two big military conglomerates that have vast interests in mining, beer, cigarettes, construction and banking. Well over 400 civilians have been killed since February 1. Hundreds have been wounded. More than 2500 pro-democracy activists, including civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her Australian economics adviser, Professor Sean Turnell, are in detention.
The generals remain far from isolated. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was in Naypyidaw in January, shortly before the coup, to toast a new arms deal. His deputy, General Alexander Fomin, was at Saturday’s Army Day celebrations, to demonstrate Mr Putin’s support for the junta. Amid reports of clandestine flights from Beijing carrying more arms supplies to Naypyidaw, Beijing sent a special envoy. Doubtless to General Hlaing’s delight, major regional democracies including India, as well as members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, including Vietnam, Laos and Thailand, also attended. Australia has rightly been at the forefront of calling on ASEAN to do more to pressure fellow member Myanmar. Yet, ASEAN has done little so far. Its failure to act at a time when Russia and China are doubling down on their support is a warning to the West of what is at stake as the crisis in one of the nation’s most strategic nations escalates. Russia and China are playing a crucial role at the UN in preventing any action by the world body. As veto powers, they have been able to block international moves against the Myanmar military regime. That makes it even more important for democracies such as Japan and South Korea to isolate the junta. Saturday’s bloodbath shows the need for a more widespread global effort. Myanmar’s nine fellow ASEAN members, especially Thailand and Singapore, which exert major influence on the country’s economy, must do more. The nefarious support roles being played by Russia and China as the generals intensify their killing of civilians suggests it is imperative the world’s democracies find an effective way to bring the pressure to bear on the generals.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Tough scrutiny is necessary on all foreign investment	The Australian	Chinese firms should not build the Victorian police headquarters Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has made the right decision to block a Chinese government-backed bid for a construction company with sensitive building projects in Australia. Rejecting foreign investment is always a difficult decision for any country that relies heavily on global markets and has grown rich through the use of foreign capital. The decision to block China on security grounds will no doubt add to tensions with our biggest trading partner but it is not without precedent and reflects rising geopolitical challenges.
Mr Frydenberg did not make a formal declaration to stop China State Construction Engineering Corporation from buying the South African-owned Probuild. But the Chinese firm withdrew its $300m bid after getting advice from the Treasurer before Christmas that the acquisition would be refused. China on Tuesday responded angrily to the block, saying Canberra had “weaponised the concept of national security” and was being discriminatory.
There were two obvious problems with the bid. The first is China State Construction’s links to China’s defence industry. This was compounded by the fact that Probuild was also involved in the construction of the Victorian police headquarters and CSL’s Melbourne HQ, which is producing COVID-19 vaccines. Rejection of the bid follows Mr Frydenberg’s refusal in April last year of China Mengniu Dairy Co’s proposed $600m acquisition of Lion Dairy & Drinks. Mr Frydenberg also officially rejected Hong Kong-based CK Group’s $13bn bid for Australia’s east coast gas pipeline owner, APA Group, in 2018.
Mr Frydenberg is not the first treasurer to face hard questions on foreign investment. Peter Costello blocked Shell’s bid to take over Woodside Petroleum in 2001 because it would give away too much control over the timing of resource development. Wayne Swan limited Chinalco’s investment in Rio Tinto to 14.99 per cent due to fears a full merger would give China too much market influence. Joe Hockey blocked US grain giant ADM from buying GrainCorp and Scott Morrison as treasurer used his powers to block Chinese government-backed and Hong Kong-based interests from bidding for NSW electricity distributor Ausgrid. It was the Turnbull government’s decision to prevent China’s Huawei from investing in Australia’s 5G network in 2018 that helped to spark the current, escalating row with Beijing. Our decision on Huawei was closely watch by Western allies and mirrored. In a list of grievances issued by China against Australia, the Huawei decision was highlighted along with the blocking of 10 Chinese foreign investment deals across infrastructure, agriculture and animal husbandry sectors. Official complaints from the Chinese government only serve to underscore the fact that Chinese corporations often are merely an extension of the communist state.
Rejection of the Probuild acquisition coincides with the introduction of tough new foreign investment rules in Australia, China and elsewhere. From January 1, new measures took effect in Australia that the Morrison government said were the most significant reforms to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 in nearly 50 years. The reforms were drafted to ensure that our foreign investment framework “keeps pace with emerging risks and global developments, including similar changes to foreign investment regimes in comparable countries”. Under the new rules, foreign investors are required to seek approval for all investments in sensitive national security land or businesses (including starting such a business), regardless of value. The move to tighter control over foreign investment is a global trend. In December, China’s National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Commerce announced new rules to strengthen the national security review of foreign investment into China. Those new laws take effect on January 18, and echo the global movement towards adopting more stringent review regimes. In the US, the Committee on Foreign Investment has bolstered its review processes with clear intent to restrict Chinese companies’ access to critical technologies. Given the current state of global relations, there are good reasons for governments to be hypersensitive to investments that give other nations access to key areas of infrastructure, and research and development. Any criticisms of the decision to stop China State Construction gaining access to sensitive building jobs such as the Victorian police headquarters can be seen in this context of heightened tensions and a new global reality.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Quad summit a historic step in collective security	The Australian	Chinese leaders have stepped up their aggressive rhetoric in Beijing Chinese leaders attending the annual National People’s Congress in Beijing will be well aware of the historic first summit of leaders of the Quadrilateral Alliance. If they ever seriously doubted the determination of major democracies to stand up to Chinese belligerence and bullying, especially in our region, it will be demonstrated when US President Joe Biden and prime ministers Narendra Modi of India, Yoshihide Suga of Japan and Scott Morrison hold their unprecedented virtual meeting. The summit, the Prime Minister says, will “send a strong message” to the Indo-Pacific about Australia’s support for a stable, independent region. “It was the first thing I discussed with President Biden and I was so pleased that other leaders are so enthusiastic about the program, and President Biden is taking this to another level. It will be a historic moment.’’ As Paul Kelly wrote on Wednesday, the Quad, as it is known, is not an Asian NATO. Neither is it a military alliance. But it is of increasing importance to the strategic balance in our region. Collectively, it aims to do whatever is needed to ensure China behaves and observes a rules-based world order, like other nations. The fact that Mr Biden, less than two months after he succeeded Donald Trump, has made the summit one of his earliest multilateral engagements speaks volumes, as his spokeswoman said, about the importance he places “on close co-operation with our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific”. That is good news for the region, and it should be a cause for China to think hard.
The focus of the summit will be on “maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region, climate change, and the economic effect of COVID-19”, the spokeswoman said. The main purpose will be the Quad’s relaunch in a way that puts “strategic grunt” and heft behind the warnings and concerns that each of the major democracies has about Chinese aggression and threats to freedom of navigation through the South China Sea. The summit is intended to show, Kelly noted, that with Mr Biden in the White House, the US, India, Japan and Australia believe there is strong collective interest in working together in devising responses to China. The aim is “strength in numbers” to send a clear signal to Beijing, while also reassuring the 10 ASEAN nations that are worried about being caught in the crossfire of a US-China power struggle.
Such messaging is pertinent as leaders at the National People’s Congress in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing intensify their menacing rhetoric. On Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said he was deliberately ratcheting up the mood of a deepening crisis across the region. He warned delegates of the People’s Liberation Army that they must be “prepared to respond” to “complex and difficult” situations. “The current security situation of our country is largely unstable and uncertain,” he claimed.
Defence Minister General Wei Fenghe spoke of China entering a “high-risk phase”. He mentioned Beijing’s intensifying cross-border dispute with India in the Himalayas, “simmering” tensions with Japan in the East China Sea, tensions over the South China Sea, and technological rivalry with the US.
On Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted tensions over Taiwan, warning Mr Biden “not to cross the red line” over the democratic island nation’s future and Beijing’s desire to subjugate it. There was “no room for compromise or concessions on the Taiwan issue”, he said.
Mr Wang issued his blunt warning as Washington’s commander in the Asia-Pacific, Admiral Philip Davidson, told a US Senate committee that China could invade Taiwan within six years as part of a strategy to supplant the US as the dominant power in the Asia-Pacific. Nothing better underlines the importance of the Quad summit. The region’s leading democratic nations carry a heavy responsibility in seeking to elevate the four-nation group into a force that will both meet the challenge posed by China’s threats and leave smaller regional nations in no doubt that they can count on help in dealing with Chinese bullying. Mr Morrison’s refrain that Australia does not seek the “containment” of China but wants to ensure strategic balance in the region and that Beijing observes a rules-based order is sound. Mr Trump, during his turbulent time in the White House, did what he could but he was ineffective in mobilising regional support beyond Australia and Japan. The uncertainty that overshadowed his foreign policy played into Beijing’s strategy of undercutting regional confidence in the US as a reliable ally. The Quad summit will be an opportunity for Mr Biden to rebuild trust. It is early days, but the Quad could become our most important strategic grouping after ANZUS. Australia has a crucial role alongside the US, India and Japan to achieve the co-ordinated responses needed to counter Beijing’s belligerence.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Celebrating the migrant mosaic	The Australian	Chinese-Australians speak with a multiplicity of voices Graham Lloyd’s series on the ethnic Chinese in Australia is a compelling reminder that there is rarely such a thing as a monolithic migrant community. It’s true that the number of Chinese-born people living here began to increase rapidly not long before China under President Xi Jinping took on more chauvinistic and authoritarian features. But the Chinese presence in Australia has a long history and it is to be hoped that today’s troubles with Beijing prove to be a passing irritant and that mutual benefit will return as the bedrock of bilateral relations.
Discovery of gold in the 1850s first attracted a sizeable number of Chinese with an adventurous spirit. After World War II the source of many ethnic Chinese arrivals was Southeast Asia. In the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square repression of 1989, the inflow of mainlanders, many with high levels of education, began to give the “Chinese Australian” demographic the considerable heft it has today. For most of this recent period, China was a good news story: a rewarding partner in trade and the key market for a lucrative inbound education industry.
Now our economy suffers with pandemic, we are caught in a power struggle between China and the US, and some Chinese Australians are understandably anxious. There’s no doubt anti-Chinese racism is a strand in our history (think of the Lambing Flat Riots of 1861 and Federation’s White Australia policy), but multi-ethnic Australia has become a remarkably open and welcoming place. The history of the ethnic Chinese diaspora here is one of considerable success and achievement, and the wish to bring in family members remains strong.
When racist incidents do occur, of course they require a decisive response. But exaggerating racism is recklessly counter-productive. Chinese authorities have tried to play the racism card to discourage international students, to punish Australia economically and to distract attention from their attempts to exert political influence within our sovereign borders. This goes back several years, at least as far back as 2008 when Beijing organised students to frustrate pro-Tibet protests during the Olympic torch relay in Canberra. More recently, attempts to control Chinese community organisations and to interfere in our party politics have been well documented. There is evidence of several ethnic Chinese — not all Australian citizens — enabling this strategy. Some appear unabashed partisans of the Chinese Communist Party, others convince themselves that alignment with Beijing’s interests in truth serves Australia’s future.
Those outside the Chinese diaspora should remember the pressures that apply. Attachment to China as a mother country (as opposed to the regime) does not make anyone less Australian. But there is a darker side. The party leadership has updated its authoritarianism with surveillance technology and is willing to punish mainland families for the dissent of relatives abroad. Mr Xi’s chauvinism implies that all ethnic Chinese, regardless of birthplace or legal nationality, owe a higher duty to the party as the custodian of Chineseness. Given the risks they face, the significant number of Chinese Australians who defy Beijing and stand up for democracy and human rights are all the more heroic. Their courage and connections are vital for Australia to maintain its independent policy.
They are living proof that the CCP does not own Chinese people, their culture or their ancient civilisation. And some of today’s clearest, most urgent expressions of liberalism — ideas fostered in the West but with broad appeal — have come from democracy activists in Hong Kong. China certainly has its own authoritarian traditions but, for many Chinese, Leninist totalitarianism is an import destructive of Chinese values. Hence the astonishment when the party that requires family members to inform on each other attempted to co-opt Confucianism. But beyond any tribal politics, it’s vital to keep in mind that as a pluralistic society, Australia gives both the locally born and recent arrivals the freedom to develop as individuals with views and opinions beyond the supposed party line of any imagined subculture.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
States muddle students’ return	The Australian	Choice matters, but schools should be nudged to open up
The jumble of messages from the education sector is worrying parents as their children gear up for term two, which is under way in some states and about to start in others. The advice from Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee has been consistent from the outset of the coronavirus pandemic; that is, schools should be open and have strict social-distancing measures in place. It was understandable, when caseload numbers were rising towards the end of term one, why most parents opted to keep their children at home. After the respite of Easter holidays, getting children back to school is an important step towards reopening the economy, as Scott Morrison said on Thursday.
Despite good leadership in containing the virus, the national cabinet has failed to find a uniform approach on the return to school. Families in some states can only wonder about the ideas being proposed. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says students will make a staggered return to classrooms from May 11, starting with one day a week. As parents scramble to readjust their work schedules they may wonder why just one day. Queensland, where the term has started, is in a muddle with the Education Department and the state teachers union offering conflicting advice. The Palaszczuk government reasonably cites the AHPCC advice, which encourages students to maintain a 1.5m distance when entering or leaving classrooms and for classroom furniture to be arranged with as much space as possible between students. The Queensland Teachers Union, however, insists classes with more than 12 pupils are unacceptable, with even fewer students in smaller classrooms. The union’s promise to down tools if its provisos are not met is unhelpful.
At Perth’s Hale School for boys, one of the first schools to switch to online learning when the COVID-19 crisis erupted, headmaster Dean Dell’Oro has sent out a clear, practical and detailed plan that covers many of the issues concerning parents. In a staggered start from next Wednesday, the school’s priority will be for years 11 and 12 students to start first. Pre-primary to Year 2 pupils also will start that day, as will students with special needs and those whose parents work in the health sector. Changes to maintain physical distancing during class and lunch are clear. Bringing the senior students back first makes good sense. They are more mature to cope with the necessary changes, and they are in the most critical phase of their studies.
Victorian Education Minister James Merlino overreacted on Thursday when he blasted the Fitzroy Community School in Melbourne’s inner north as “reckless” for planning to return to face-to-face teaching next week. But with COVID-19 testing being ramped up and the number of new cases plummeting, even Victorian health authorities, who have been ultra-cautious in insisting on remote learning for all of term two, appear to be opening the door to getting students back in earlier. In the current predicament, where leadership and compliance have put us in an enviable position, choice and common sense are vital. Children appear to be largely unaffected by COVID-19 but could be asymptomatic “silent spreaders”. It would make sense if the families of children who live with grandparents or adults with compromised immune systems decided to concentrate on online learning at home for now. Teachers unions’ concerns for their members health and wellbeing are also reasonable. Allowances need to be made for vulnerable and older teachers to concentrate on duties outside busy classrooms.After so long in hibernation, it is understandable that parents are anxious about risking their children catching the coronavirus at school and putting them back on to public transport. It makes sense to hasten slowly. And schools need good plans in place. But as the Prime Minister says, reopening schools is an important step in the nation’s recovery and in moving people off JobKeeper and JobSeeker. It is also important, as he says, in ensuring children receive the best education. Reopening schools will be a significant step in the return to normal. It needs to be done right.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Rape allegation from 33 years ago is unresolvable	The Australian	Christian Porter will be forced to live with a cloud over his character Amid frenetic social media speculation and finger pointing, Attorney-General Christian Porter, the nation’s most senior law officer, did the right thing on Wednesday when he identified himself as the cabinet minister at the centre of rape allegations from 33 years ago. He had no alternative. In doing so, he cleared his 16 male cabinet colleagues from a ghastly suspicion that was hanging over them all. Mr Porter was 17 at the time of the alleged incident and the alleged victim was 16. Both were elite debaters attending an event at the University of Sydney in January 1988. The woman, who reportedly did not take the matter to NSW police until early last year, took her own life in June. Hours before doing so, she reportedly contacted police to say she did not want the investigation continued. Neither were her parents keen to see her pursue the matter. “They worried that she may have confected or embellished the allegations due to her mental illness,” according to a letter recently circulated to several politicians, including Scott Morrison, and to police.
At his press conference, Mr Porter vehemently denied raping the woman. Neither did they have consensual sex, he insisted. “We didn’t have anything of that nature happen between us,” he said. He was less certain about whether they had ever been alone together. He never visited her room, he said. But later he remembered that the woman had taught him and two other boys to iron their shirts. It is not clear where the ironing took place.
On the other hand, as Paul Kelly wrote on Wednesday, nobody reading the material sent to the Prime Minister, Labor frontbencher Penny Wong and Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young and police could doubt the woman’s belief she had been raped: “The letter names many friends of the woman, who, it says, believed her account. Central to the current ­dilemma is the time factor and, more importantly, that the woman took her own life.” The woman’s friends and journalists who have taken up her cause will now be combing Mr Porter’s words on Wednesday and comparing them with the material they have collected to find any discrepancies. He was adamant that he and the woman had not been in contact for 33 years.
Mr Porter is now taking a few weeks off “for my sanity”. He will seek assistance for his mental health. He was under intense duress on Wednesday and close to tears. But his debating skills, honed through a long and distinguished legal and political career, came to the fore. No, he would not resign as Attorney-General. Allegations should not equal resignation: “If that happens, anyone in public life is able to be removed simply by the printing of an allegation,” he said. “Every child we raise can have their lives destroyed by online reporting of accusations alone. My guess is if I were to resign and that set a new standard, there wouldn’t be much need for an attorney-general anyway because there would be no rule of law left to protect in this country, so I will not be part of letting that happen while I am Attorney-General.” Fair enough. He should stand firm on that important principle, with Mr Morrison’s backing. Neither did Mr Porter rule out defamation proceedings against some of those making “just incredible” claims against him. Sniping from the sidelines, Malcolm Turnbull made an unhelpful call for an inquest into the woman’s death. “We don’t know for sure that she took her own life. We know for sure that she’s dead, and there needs to be an inquest,” he told the ABC. That decision is up to South Australian State Coroner, David Whittle, who is awaiting more information from police.
It remains to be seen how high a political price Mr Porter and the government will be forced to pay over the matter, especially in the febrile atmosphere generated by several sexual assault and harassment allegations, including by former Liberal staff member Brittany Higgins, who alleges she was raped in March 2019 in then defence industry minister Linda Reynolds’ parliamentary office. Reports that Senator Reynolds referred to Ms Higgins as a “lying cow” in front of staff — a remark for which she later apologised — will add to the tensions.
Australians want justice for rape victims. But they expect due process, understand that not all allegations are true, and support the presumption of innocence. After Mr Porter’s press conference, a friend of the alleged victim who was in contact with her up to the time of her death told The Australian: “I implore the government to understand that the pressure will only go up and not down and that this is not the iceberg, this is only the tip of the iceberg.” The tragedy for all concerned is that the allegation can never be resolved through the correct channel — the legal system. The woman will never have her say in court. Mr Porter will not have the opportunity to defend his reputation and clear his name legally. And the matter is so murky and vague that details of the allegation are unknown to the public or even to Mr Porter himself, judging by his answers on Wednesday. He did not appear to know, for example, until it was raised by a journalist, that the attack allegedly involved forced oral sex, followed by rape, in the woman’s room at the university. Despite the gravity of the allegations, he appeared to be in the dark.
NSW police have closed the investigation into the allegation due to “insufficient admissible evidence”. That was always likely in the absence of a complainant and in light of the woman’s request before her death for police to stop the investigation. Mr Porter has argued against any other form of inquiry, as advocated by his political opponents and some in the media. But as he acknowledged, “these are matters for other people to determine”. Any such inquiry, he said, would put him on trial to “disprove something that didn’t happen 33 years ago”. Senator Hanson-Young is pushing for an inquiry. Anthony Albanese says it could be pursued through a coronial inquiry in South Australia, where the woman died, or an investigation similar to the High Court’s probe into allegations against judge Dyson Heydon. That parallel is problematic. The Heydon probe was able to interview several women about workplace issues concerning sexual harassment and reach conclusions. But any independent inquiry into the rape allegation will face the same obstacle the NSW police faced — lack of evidence. Such an inquiry would set a bad ­precedent, as Kelly wrote, forcing a minister facing 33-year-old rape accusations “to face an alternative ­default process” because the legal system could not put him on trial. This would be a far-reaching, adverse step for politics and for justice in our society.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
MPs should reflect the community they serve	The Australian	Citizens are entitled to feel pride in their parliament and members
For credibility and consistency, the Liberal Party must quickly find a way to achieve its stated target for an equal number of men and women in its parliamentary ranks by 2025. As things stand, one of the Morrison government’s main messages for world leaders is that targets are worthless without action to back them up. Australia’s position on climate change action is that we set achievable targets and find innovative ways to deliver them on time and in full. But inside the Liberal Party, when it comes to women in parliament, there has been a big promise made — yet it has been woefully underdelivered, with no obvious plan to move ahead. Against a target of 50 per cent women by 2025, only 25.4 per cent of Liberal MPs across federal and state parliaments in July last year were women. This was an increase of just 3 per cent in four years.
Having been caught in a whirlwind of sexual politics in Canberra in recent months, Scott Morrison is attempting to overcome what has become a deep-seated perception that his party has a problem with women. At a press conference in Canberra on Tuesday, the Prime Minister said there had never been a more important time for women to stand in parliament. “I want to see more women in this place. I have done many things to get more women in this place and I intend to do more,” Mr Morrison said. “I have put more women in my cabinet than any other prime minister ever has before and I look forward to doing more. I need women to stand with me as we go about this, as we stand together.” Pushing the issue further, Mr Morrison reopened debate on the divisive issue of whether the Liberal Party should follow Labor with a quota system to make sure that gender targets are met. The ALP has increased its female representation from 11.82 per cent to 47.87 per cent since 1994, when the quota system was introduced. Labor’s gender push is supported by EMILY’s List, a financial, political and personal support network for Labor women in politics. The body provides mentors and the foundations on which to build a successful campaign and attract more financial support. Mr Morrison said he had been open to the conversation about quotas for some time. “I think many Liberals have been coming to this view (a quota system) over time,” he said.
The Australian has always been opposed to quotas. Neither do we believe the issue of gender balance within the major parties is the key to resolving the cultural issues and claims of sometimes criminal misbehaviour that have dominated Canberra in recent weeks. Any suggestion that all women behave well and all men behave badly is ludicrous. But it is easy to understand that the sorts of workplace behaviour at Parliament House that have been exposed publicly in recent days are enough to discourage both men and women of high character from wanting to run for public office.
This is a tragedy for the nation. Australia deserves the brightest and best leaders, and parliamentarians who truly reflect the people they serve. It would be foolish to think that the current crop of MPs on both sides of the house is the best that can be offered up to voters. The highest quality candidates, regardless of gender, are needed to lift the intellectual and professional firepower on both the government and opposition benches. Meritocracy is gender neutral, but the challenge for the Liberal Party to meet its 2025 target starts from the ground up. As Nick Cater writes on Thursday, the disproportionate representation of women in the Liberal Party runs deep. Female membership of the Young Liberal movement sits at 34.8 per cent women to 65.2 per cent men. The senior party records female membership of 42.9 per cent women and 57.1 per cent men. Research by the Menzies Research Centre claims that progress is being made. Of the 14 new Liberal members elected to the House of Representatives in May 2019, seven were men and seven were women.
It is outrageous nonetheless that Australia’s political parties do not reflect more properly the society they serve. This includes the Liberal Party getting its house in order with regard to its targets on women. It is incumbent on leaders in both the public and private sectors to make sure that there is no discrimination on the basis of gender or race. Many companies have achieved good results using measurable, achievable targets to improve female representation in the workforce without setting quotas. A priority to achieving a political system that better reflects and serves its public masters is to work hard to remove the barriers to entry that disproportionately affect women, but not only women. This includes areas such as childcare, workplace flexibility and sensible working hours. Janet Albrechtsen hit a nerve with many readers when she set out a road map to improve parliamentary behaviour. Her list included shorter working hours and banning alcohol and introducing drug and alcohol testing for workers including MPs and staff. Citizens are entitled to feel pride in their parliament and the people who represent them. For that, parliament must be a place that reflects our country, our communities, our families and the values that define us as a nation.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Team Australia digs in for challenge of the century	The Australian	Civil and constructive discourse needed in coronavirus fight
In the Prime Minister’s courtyard at Parliament House, our head of government outlined the awful contours and forbidding scale of the health, social and economic calamity of the coronavirus pandemic. “This is a once-in-a-hundred-year type event,” Scott Morrison said, announcing an unprecedented travel ban and harsh restrictions on social contact. “We are going to keep Australia running. We are going to keep Australia functioning. It won’t look like it normally does but it is very important that we continue to put in place measures that are scalable and sustainable. There is no two-week answer to what we’re confronting. There is no short-term, quick fix to how this is dealt with in Australia.” Mr Morrison spoke powerfully to the Australian people, both as national leader and as one of us. After initial circumspection in these matters, he has now sketched out in broad terms a disruption to normal life for six months, perhaps more, and the privations citizens could expect because of travel restrictions and social distancing. Mr Morrison addressed the small picture as well, scolding people for bulk-buying supplies: “Stop doing it. It’s ridiculous. It’s un-Australian, and it must stop.” It looked like a principal shaming errant schoolchildren. He’d said it before, but his emphatic display came with the risk of overkill. Yet someone had to say it. In an emergency, the Prime Minister has first call on the national stage.
Australians have many sources of information; facts and official directives can be lost in a digital blizzard of gossip, hearsay, fakery and mischief. In an era of plummeting trust in politicians and institutions, authority is not a given. There was a lot for the public to absorb, with the national cabinet banning non-essential gatherings of more than 100 people; a lifting of the travel advice for Australians to the highest level (do not travel abroad); restrictions on aged-care visits; cancellation of Anzac Day events; a relaxation of international student nurse visa conditions; and aviation industry support measures.
Big decisions are made every few days via the evolving instrument of a national cabinet, made up of the Prime Minister, six premiers and two chief ministers; the group comprises four Liberal and five Labor members. There are strong and competing views on the way forward, while data are imperfect. This big-tent approach, at the behest of Mr Morrison, maximises co-ordination in decision-making and aids information sharing; it is in stark contrast to 100 years ago, when our young federation confronted the Spanish flu pandemic. A struggle over state and commonwealth powers, just after World War I, almost tore the country apart. On the medical front, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee is comprised of all state and territory chief health officers, and is chaired by Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy. There is a diversity of views, unity of purpose and orderly process in the Team Australia structure.
The public has clearly expressed a preference for regular information, from a single, reliable source. No one person in a plural society has a lock on wisdom or complete authority. But the Prime Minister is head of the executive government. People expect him to step into this front-and-centre role and lead the policy responses, as well as the messaging. Dr Murphy and his deputy, Paul Kelly, have been the conduits for practical medical instructions and the AHPPC’s emergency high-end policy advice. News outlets, as is their duty, will continue to probe political and medical leaders about their decisions, policing the space between what they say and what they do; being discerning in who they present as experts, who can add nutritional value to the public’s information diet, is the job description.
The broader public discourse, however, is not always open, constructive, informed or civil. Our politics are robust, too often unedifying. Still, opposition politicians, no matter at what level of government, have a legitimate and key role to play in questioning policy decisions, holding leaders to account and making practical suggestions during the shutdowns. All MPs can modify such roles; it’s why we send them to parliament. Politicians are ground-level custodians, problem-solvers, witnesses and listeners.
Given the wartime metaphors and emergency policy footing, there’s a view that Anthony Albanese should have been part of the national cabinet. There are obvious pros and cons. The Opposition Leader has been a fixture in Canberra since 1996 and he is the alternative prime minister. But our politics have a deficit of goodwill and trust. The Labor leader’s exclusion is an opportunity, as well as a risk — for both leaders. Mr Albanese does not, at this stage, have much to grumble about. Nor can he simply disappear, vacating the platform he has spent a career seeking. It’s a delicate, unenviable task.
But some experts, in public policy and medical affairs, clearly have axes to grind; others simply have relevance deprivation syndrome — and it shows. A few who have recent experience in crisis management or the executive are big-noting themselves by offering public advice on options they know are actively in the policy mix. Lo and behold, they’re paragons of anticipation and wisdom when the subsequent step is taken. Does this help the public? No. Does it soothe tender egos? For a while, sure. But to reboot Kevin07, this sort of reckless speaking must stop.We are in a fast-moving situation. Messaging is now up with the play and cutting through. Early on, as the extent of the crisis unfolding was unclear, the Prime Minister’s briefings were cautious. He tried not to reveal too much, lest he be seen as “speculating” or causing “public anxiety”. His go-to phrase, “abundance of caution”. We now see that the measures we must take aren’t in fact abundant, they’re necessary, prudent, reasonable and realistic. “Reason and realism are good,” writes Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan. They must be our touchstones in public discourse because, as Mr Morrison explained, “life is changing in Australia, as it is changing all around the world”.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Diatribe report for doomsayers	The Australian	Claims that every child faces existential threats are asinine
Bad luck, kids. You don’t live in Burundi, Chad, Somalia, the Central African Republic or the Democratic Republic of the Congo. So just suck it up. Failed African states, among the most cruel, corrupt and violent in the world and torn apart by wars and poverty, have been ranked in the top 10 for “sustainability’’ in a new global report. It was released by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and scientific journal The Lancet, and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Australia was rated 174 out of 180 nations on the “sustainability’’ index that put 10 African states at the top. Australia was just behind the US and ahead of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Developed nations, the authors said, were “ threatening the future’’ of children’’ with high carbon emissions, junk food and alcohol advertising and time online. The doomsday tome, overseen by former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark, urges “immediate action on child and adolescent health … to ensure children have a future on this planet’’. It demands an urgent end to CO2 emissions, crackdowns on advertising, heavy investment in child rights and incorporating children’s voices into policy decisions. Would Greta Thunberg help us out and wag more school to set up a third chamber of parliament for minors?
Ms Clark’s hysterical assertion that “every child worldwide now faces existential threats from climate change and commercial pressures’’ reflected the report’s mangled logic. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former Ethiopian politician and academic, described the report as a “wake-up call’’. He’s right. The ideological drivel, set out in didactic bureaucrat-speak, should wake up politicians to ask: does Australia need to rethink the tens of millions of dollars taxpayers contribute to the UN and its affiliates each year?
On Wednesday, local academics stepped out of their ivory towers to claim, falsely, that Australia has been “disgraced’’ on the world stage. The nation has “lost its way’’, according to Liz Hanna, an Australian National University academic who chairs the Environmental Health Working Group at the World Federation of Public Health Associations. This “rigorous’’ study, Dr Hanna said, married “the voices of children with global metrics”. It also showed why “the world’s children are uprising, demanding governments protect their future’’. We can only assume that Paul Read, a senior research fellow at the Monash Sustainability Institute, was joking when he said Australia was Sir Les Patterson, “the drunken uncle at every wedding that doesn’t seem to realise what he’s doing wrong’’. Wasting money on spurious “research’’ perhaps? University of Queensland academic Peter Sly, a local author of the report, called for governments to “impose restrictions that truly protect children’’ against fast food and gambling advertisements. Another UQ academic, Jackob Najman, nailed the issue when he said including the sustainability index as a measure of child health outcomes was “fanciful’’ and a “contrivance’’.By overlooking inconvenient truths — including the fact that Australia contributes just 1.3 per cent of global CO2 emissions — the authors shredded any credibility they might otherwise have had. So did their apparent indifference to the mortality and suffering of children in developing nations and the corruption behind so much of it. Their rants demanding the banning of junk food, alcohol and gambling advertising during children’s television viewing times were hollow. A more mature approach would suggest sugar, alcohol and gambling are part of life and that parents take responsibility for teaching children to be discerning consumers. Censorship is one of the hallmarks of authoritarian societies, the dire problems of which were largely conveniently ignored by the WHO, UNICEF and The Lancet. Given the grave issues of survival confronting children in poor nations and problems such as cancer and other diseases still unsolved, the world’s children deserve far better than this rubbish.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
No nation an island with Covid	The Australian	Close international co-operation on a vaccine is essential Scott Morrison set an example for leaders everywhere when he warned last Friday against the dangers of increasing “vaccine nationalism” in the global battle to defeat COVID-19. “There’s never been a global effort like this,” the Prime Minister said, pledging that if Australian researchers were successful in finding a vaccine, their success would be shared with the rest of the world.
With 120 vaccine research projects under way internationally, involving 1000 clinical trials, he argued that “any country that were to find this vaccine and not make it available around the world without restraint, I think, would be judged terribly by history”.
He was right. Moves by the US, the European Union and Britain to go it alone in striking deals with major global drug manufacturers to corner the market and secure many millions of doses of whatever vaccine emerges may be understandable. There can also be little surprise that the US, China and Russia have shunned the multinational COVAX initiative formed under the auspices of the World Health Organisation to ensure equitable access by all countries to a vaccine.
But their attitudes raise concerns about what Medecins Sans Frontieres has termed “a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism” that could potentially see a replay of the 2009-10 H1N1 flu virus. During epidemics of that much milder disease, rich nations bought up most of the available vaccine supplies, leaving much of the world with none. As former head of the US Agency for International Development Gayle Smith says, there is a risk that some countries are doing “exactly what we feared — which is every man for himself’’. For as long as the deadly pandemic continues to rage in any country, no other country will be safe. It is overwhelmingly in the interests of every nation to co-operate to defeat COVID-19, and any future pandemics.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Tense islands in the virus stream, that is what we are	The Australian	Closing state borders is wrecking tourism and supply chains On May 8, Scott Morrison handed over responsibility for reopening Australia’s economy to eight premiers and chief ministers. It wasn’t hand-wringing by the Prime Minister but a passing of the baton and microphone to states and territories for implementing the three-stage recovery plan shaped by national cabinet. That framework for easing restrictions would see a COVID-safe economy operating by July, with a goal of restoring 850,000 jobs, according to Treasury estimates. By then, the full boost to gross domestic product would be $9.4bn a month. Given myriad differences in restrictions — some states had closed their borders, schools were on a range of timetables — and rates of new infections, there is no way Canberra can dictate the big thaw. But it now means state and territory leaders own their settings and, like it or not, are politically responsible for the financial hardships that flow from delays.
Ultra-cautious Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is exercising her discretion in keeping the state’s border closed. On Monday, Ms Palaszczuk said “things would look more positive towards September”. What? In any case, she added, the ultimate decision belonged to Queensland’s Chief Health Officer, Jeannette Young. According to Dr Young the southern states need to “get all their problems sorted” first. July is the “absolute earliest” when interstate travel may be permitted; she wants to see “no new cases for two incubation periods”. An incubation period for coronavirus is typically 14 days but can be as short as five. That’s a tall, though not impossible, order. But it puts a clamp on holiday travel for cashed-up southerners and worker mobility, and digs a deeper hole for Queensland’s tourism and hospitality sector, already reeling from the ban on foreign visitors to Australia.
On Friday, Mr Morrison said that as borders fell internally and Australians holidayed at home, tourism would get back on its feet. National cabinet was told we are “net tourism importers”. Australians spend $20bn more overseas than visitors spend here. Now the travel dollar is up for grabs for local operators, a key employer in regional areas. Shut-outs by Queensland and Western Australia have drawn sharp criticism from state and business leaders. On Sunday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said interstate travel would be critical in boosting trade and delivering a flexible workforce. “The key to our economic success will be to improve our supply chains and our manufacturing base,” she said, urging the reopening of state borders as soon as possible. After successfully flattening the curve, and building up capacity for testing, tracing and intensive care units across several months, it seems daft to continue with such harsh restrictions beyond the agreed July target.
Still, the alacrity with which Sydneysiders over the weekend flicked the switch to “up close and personal” will have medical officials on edge and leave other states wary of visitors. WA Premier Mark McGowan has no time frame on when his border closure will be lifted but he is fearful of continuing community transmission in the largest two states. “Our isolation is our greatest advantage,” he said. Is this exclusion even legal? Constitutional law experts highlight sections 92 and 117 of our founding document. The first section mandates “trade, commerce, and intercourse among the states, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free”. Yet there is strong opinion a state can take reasonable measures during a health emergency, such as a pandemic, to protect its citizens. It happened a century ago with the Spanish flu. But peer-group and commercial pressure will intensify on these self-declared islands and their cautious rulers to open up. So, too, will the fiscal cost, as state tax bases are devastated and federal funding reaches its limits. National companies have every right to expect free movement of people and goods. Stage three of the road map to recovery sees a resumption of all interstate travel and consideration of a return of foreign students and a “trans-Tasman bubble”. How odd would it be, as Ms Berejiklian noted, to be allowed to travel from Sydney to Auckland but not to Perth or Brisbane. As Treasury outlined, that third stage of reopening would see another 67,000 jobs restored to Queensland and 32,000 jobs to WA. As well as managing intermittent virus outbreaks, getting Australians back to work and on the move is what success looks like. We don’t need more islands.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Leadership transcends borders	The Australian	Clumsy overreach only makes it harder to adjust to life with COVID It’s the year 2031 and at last the people have torn down the country’s concrete internal borders, with a wide-eyed child declaring “We did it! The United States of Australia”, and an old chap gently correcting her: “It’s just Australia.” This ad flogging the prosaic lamb chop has struck a chord online because it satirises a maddening reality. Many Australians, never mind their home state, have been victims of bordermania at the hands of premiers, and this campaign at least allows them a rueful laugh at what they cannot change. Western Australia is justly parodied in the ad as a secessionist holdout. In real life, its leader, Mark McGowan, talks tough as if only his NSW counterpart, Gladys Berejiklian, stands in the way of COVID-19 elimination. Many will wonder if his “crush and kill” slogan is aimed not only at the virus but also the March 13 election.
State polls have a hefty dose of parochial politics, and that’s especially the case in WA and Queensland, two provinces with geography and character that can create a sense of standing apart from the nation. To be fair, Queensland’s Annastacia Palaszczuk, safely returned to office last year after some shameless pandemic politicking, has lately found a more measured tone. In South Australia, Steven Marshall stumbled into last November’s pizza lockdown after contact tracers were misled. Victoria’s Dan Andrews probably surprises many when he denies being bent on outright elimination of COVID-19 but his latest measure — a travel permit system with a traffic-light metaphor of risk levels — is emblematic of his record. For all his reassuring patter and self-confidence, Mr Andrews presides over a government that appears to lack the basic organisation, competence and skill to run an effective public health operation.
NSW has had its bungles but its contact tracing seems to have set a national standard for speed and success, while Ms Berejiklian has been conspicuous for her measured and pragmatic approach to a complex challenge, which is easily caricatured as a no-brainer trade-off between safety and money. It is a productive economy that underpins all kinds of safety, in the long run. Jobs bolster mental wellbeing and health systems break down without the economic activity that fills the tax coffers. Fear of being marooned by a surprise border closure has become a bigger disincentive to domestic tourism than apprehension about the disease itself. If a manageable outbreak of infection leads premiers to keep closing borders, with little notice or co-ordination, this unthinking safetyism will ratchet up the pressures and risks for families and businesses. It’s naive to think that policing lines on a map will get us any closer to elimination of COVID-19. Nor can we pull up the international drawbridge to those Australians still overseas and desperate to return home, or inflict further damage on trade and tourism by stopping all overseas arrivals. It’s inevitable COVID-19 cases will continue to come into the country, demanding rigorous quarantine.
Vaccination is not going to be a swift or complete solution. It will take months to do, and it’s unclear whether a vaccinated person may nonetheless pass on the infection to someone yet to get the jab. Add to this the uncertainty about how long immunity lasts and the emergence of new variants of the virus, the latest being detected in Japan.
All this means that we need a light-touch approach to living with COVID-19, keeping the economy open, allowing people and companies to plan, and encouraging an individual and collective effort to make sensible judgments about risks and opportunities, and to tailor behaviour, social life and economic activity accordingly.
Nobody can say drastic and abrupt measures will never be needed but if they are overused or poorly executed, compounding uncertainty and sapping confidence, they risk undermining the popular morale and co-operation without which the costs of pandemic adjustment will quickly mount up and become prohibitive. That would entail considerable human suffering. Of course, premiers must be accountable to their own states but they, like the rest of us, are citizens of a federation. We have duties to other Australians that do not stop at state borders, and the same goes for the leadership responsibilities of premiers. Why else form a national cabinet? If the states had to fund JobKeeper, maybe premiers would have been less inclined to bordermania. In any event, the economic damage done by ham-fisted pandemic policy will be felt across Australia in ways totally unrelated to tribal divisions of states; WA’s self-righteous lockdowns won’t spare its people. We are actually all in this together, and that trite phrase is the true test of political leadership.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Bad government led to diabolical health outcome	The Australian	Coate inquiry details the rotten core of Victoria’s COVID response Victoria’s hotel quarantine inquiry has failed to uncover who was responsible for a decision that allowed the state’s second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to spiral out of control with deadly results, but it has damned the Andrews government as irresponsible and incompetent. Premier Daniel Andrews’ apology issued in the wake of the release of the final report on Monday does not reflect the scope of his government’s failure, forensically detailed over two volumes by inquiry head Jennifer Coate. The bottom line from the Coate report is that the Andrews government’s actions leading to the state’s second wave of infections of COVID-19 was “at odds with any normal application of the principles of the Westminster system of responsible government”.
Coate correctly rejects any temptation to excuse the government’s deficiencies due to the unusual and fast-paced nature of the pandemic. The fact that people worked hard or had wanted to do the right thing “does not excuse the deficiencies found in the program”, Coate said.
The heart of Victoria’s second wave of the pandemic that left some 800 people dead has been forensically traced to the failure of hotel quarantine. This failure was due in large measure to the use of private security guards that lacked the proper training or understanding of public health. The bigger shock, both for the inquiry and the public, has been the failure of the Victorian public sector to explain what the decision-making process was that led to such a diabolical outcome. Coate says a decision of such significance for a program, which ultimately involved the expenditure of tens of millions of dollars and the employment of thousands of people, had neither a responsible minister nor a transparent rationale for why that course was adopted. It plainly does not seem to accord with the principles of proper governance.
The influence of Victoria Police on the state decision-making is laid bare. Coate says critical to the decision was a preference expressed by then chief commissioner Graham Ashton that private security perform the role and Victoria Police provide the “back-up”. The police preference was adopted without discussion or dissent. At no time was there any consideration of the respective merits of private security versus police versus Australian Defence Force personnel. “Instead, an early mention of private security rather than police grew into a settled position, adopted by acquiescence at the SCC meeting,” the Coate report says.
Evidence to the inquiry outlines how failures in the hotel quarantine system using private contractors led to such disastrous consequences for the Victorian community. The expert evidence, based on genomic testing, was that 99 per cent of Victoria’s second wave of COVID-19 cases in the community came from transmission events related to returned travellers infecting people working at two quarantine hotels, the Rydges and the Stamford Plaza. Coate said: “What I can, and do, find is that the ‘second wave’ of COVID-19 that so catastrophically affected Victoria was linked to transmission events out of both Rydges and Stamford via returned travellers to personnel on-site, who then transmitted COVID-19 into the community … I do so having accepted the uncontroverted genomic and epidemiological evidence of (Professor Ben) Howden and Dr (Charles) Alpren and their conclusions from that evidence.” The scandal of the inquiry is that the more than 70,000 documents produced could not demonstrate how the decision to engage private contractors was made or by whom. The decision did not follow the normal process of the Expenditure Review Committee. Coate says the people of Victoria should understand, with clarity, how it was that such a decision to spend millions of dollars of public money came about. She says the public should be able to be satisfied that the action taken was a considered one that addressed the benefits, risks and options available in arriving at such a decision.
In his evidence, the Premier agreed that the question of how the decision to use private contractors was made should be capable of being answered. The head of the Victorian Public Service at the time, the then Secretary of DPC, acknowledged it was a “fair point”. The alarming finding by Coate is that the decision was made without proper analysis or even a clear articulation that it was being made at all.
The Coate inquiry does not make any recommendations for legal liability or prosecution. Coate says the question of causation as a matter of law is one, if it is to be pursued, that must be properly pleaded before a court, seized of the jurisdiction, where the rules of evidence and procedure apply and arguments and submissions on the law can be made and ruled upon.
The lack of any recommendation for prosecution should not be enough to let the Andrews government off scot-free. As Premier for six years and a former health minister, it is unreasonable for Mr Andrews to now argue that failings were made by a bureaucracy he inherited and over which he had no control. With the ravages of the second wave now passed, Mr Andrews enjoys the good wishes of many for having acted to suppress the second-wave outbreak. The verdict, however, is now in. The actions of the Andrews administration were the opposite of good government. A small outbreak was magnified by incompetence. There should be no prizes for saving people from a disaster of one’s own making.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Time to end the free lunch for Google and Facebook	The Australian	Code of conduct must be fair to media players big and small
Facebook has a squad of 15,000 people tasked with reviewing content in more than 50 languages on its site but it still can’t stop the use of its platform by mass murderers. The soldier who killed 29 people in Thailand was able to post photographs and videos from the scene.
The tech giant’s business model relies on users generating content, with Facebook leveraging that and the data it harvests. That private army of screen jockeys, however, does not produce any news content. Original journalism is costly and fraught with a multitude of difficult issues — accuracy, defamation and distribution. Although Google and Facebook leave news gathering to the professionals, their algorithms insert themselves between the producers of stories, images, video and podcasts — such as The Australian and our peers at News Corp Australia — and customers.
This is neither good for journalism nor for our democracy and citizens. “Google and Facebook have grown to have almost unfettered market power with significant impacts on consumers,” concluded Australian Competition & Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims, who led a world-first inquiry into the power of the digital platforms. As the ACCC found, 95 per cent of general searches in Australia are performed through Google, which gobbles up almost 96 per cent of search advertising revenue in Australia. Like other media companies, News Corp was seeking a strong legislated code of conduct that included all players, large and small, to be paid properly for the original content that leads to billions of clicks and dollars of ad revenue for the tech giants.
In its response, the Morrison government said platforms must enter “voluntary” codes of conduct to address many, though by no means all, of the concerns raised by media companies. Josh Frydenberg said the new code would govern “how revenue is shared, how content is accessed and presented, as well as getting forewarning about changes to algorithms that go to how the content is ranked online”.
This week News Corp Australia will begin talks with Google, with executive chairman Michael Miller writing in our pages on Monday that he is confident this year will mark “a turning point for media sustainability in the modern digital world”. The key here is fair compensation for original content. Last week News Corp global chief executive Robert Thomson said the company had begun to see “significant progress” in the “long battle” for equitable treatment from the dominant global tech platforms. He pointed to deals with Apple and Facebook that were “beginning to yield financial dividends”, particularly from The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook content licensing. These are important precedents for proper compensation.
Yet in Australia, Facebook is yet to confirm when it will join the talks on a code of conduct. The social media behemoth actually disputes the ACCC’s underlying analysis for the proposed code and appears intent on going its own way with one-off deals. Divide and conquer is not in the spirit of the local code or the government’s road map.
In December, the ACCC boss wrote to the chiefs of Google and Facebook, urging them to reach a deal with publishers quickly and in “good faith”. The Morrison government is expecting an update on the code by May. A full draft deal for the ACCC’s perusal is required by October. If the parties cannot agree on revenue sharing and other important matters, Canberra has said it will impose a mandatory code by November, with the Treasurer declaring “the government is not messing around”.We are about to find out how serious the tech giants are about reducing the harm they cause and in promoting community welfare. The Morrison government has recognised “trust us”, business as usual for the tech titans is not sustainable. It’s time to end the free lunch. As Mr Miller noted, many media outlets won’t survive ­because, while their content has helped and is helping the platforms grow their businesses, returns for publishers are inadequate. In 2018, Google earned $US136bn, largely in advertising, while Facebook’s ad revenue was $US55bn. Their combined worth is greater than the value of our sharemarket. Google and Facebook need to act ethically and pay a premium to the premium creators generating these immense profits.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Puerile encounter reflects low ebb in US political life	The Australian	Coherent arguments were few; there was no knockout blow
US voters have good reason to be disappointed in Tuesday’s first election debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. What was widely hoped for 33 days out from the election was a respectful, if robust, exchange about vital policy issues and US leadership amid one of the greatest health and economic crises of our times. Instead, as Paul Kelly described it, they got “a spiteful, chaotic, abusive, often-out-of-control brawling encounter” that displayed “the reckless deterioration of American political life and the collapse of respect for civic life”.
Both men must shoulder the blame. Mr Trump was always going to emerge like a cage fighter, determined to flatten his opponent. But even by his own standards of bullying and ad hominem attacks he overplayed his hand. He interrupted Mr Biden so often that he did not allow the challenger enough time to make the mistakes and gaffes the President claimed Mr Biden’s dotage and diminishing acuity would lead him into. As Washington correspondent Cameron Stewart noted, it was a clash between the towering, red-faced Mr Trump, 74, and his white-haired, 77-year-old challenger that was “ugly to watch”. Mr Trump repeatedly interrupted Mr Biden while moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News tried in vain to get him to conform with the rules agreed by both sides. “He (Trump) looked like a bully … let’s face it, he is a bully,” Greg Sheridan wrote.
Mr Biden was not much better, interrupting almost as much. The candidate who says he wants to restore dignity to national and international politics and bring the US together after the “disaster” of the Trump presidency hurled his own abuse, calling, Mr Trump a “racist”, telling him to “shut up” and complaining: “It’s hard to get anywhere with this clown — excuse me, this person.” At one point he said: “Keep yapping, man.” In an unedifying display, the pair spun falsehoods as fast as each other. US voters have seldom seen anything as bad between two contenders to lead the free world. The 10 per cent of as yet undecided voters, in particular, deserved better than what The Wall Street Journal summed up as a “depressing fiasco” of “insults, interruptions, endless cross-talk, exaggerations and flat-out lies”.
Mr Trump gave a clear defence of his move to fill the Supreme Court vacancy before the election. Other serious issues were touched on but mostly went nowhere. Those hoping for a serious examination of tax policy, economic rebuilding or healthcare were disappointed. “Under this President we’ve become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided and more violent,” Mr Biden claimed. “It is what it is because you are what you are.” Mr Trump responded: “In 47 months, I’ve done more than you did in 47 years, Joe … There’s nothing smart about you.” Mr Trump tried to play the man, not the ball, injecting Mr Biden’s son, Hunter, into proceedings. The President also dodged a direct question about whether it was true that he paid just $US750 in federal tax in 2016 and 2017, insisting he paid “millions of dollars”. The crucial issue of the pandemic gained little momentum. The contenders bounced from subject to subject. And Mr Trump let Mr Biden get away with his claim that he has a plan to deal with the COVID-19 crisis without saying what it is.
Mr Trump drew out Mr Biden on the extent to which he is a puppet of the far left, including militant elements in the Democratic Party, and would do their bidding if he won by opposing police funding and law enforcement. But it was lost amid the name-calling. “Your party is socialist, and they’re going to dominate you, Joe,” Mr Trump said. “I am the Democratic Party right now,” Mr Biden shot back.
Asked about the violence in US cities and whether he would condemn white supremacist groups, Mr Trump responded “Sure.” But he added: “Almost everything I see is from the left wing. Not from the right wing.” A white supremacist group called Proud Boys should “stand back, stand by”, he said, a remark that drew condemnation from black groups. Mr Biden foolishly claimed the far-left anarchist movement Antifa was “an idea, not an organisation”. Mr Biden committed no major gaffes. And with such low expectations of him, he did not have to do much beyond get through the 90 minutes. The immediate US media narrative was that Mr Trump’s nasty bullying would alienate many voters. But amid the uncertainties of US politics there is no certainty it will. It also could have the opposite effect and invigorate his base, boosting their determination to keep Mr Biden out of the White House. At times, Mr Biden also looked nasty, and weak. The encounter did not confirm Mr Trump’s portrayal of his challenger as “Sleepy Joe”, on performance-enhancing drugs, barely able to put a sentence together. With Mr Biden well ahead in pre-debate polls, Mr Trump wanted a game changer. He did not get it. US voters are entitled to more than another slanging match when the pair face off again on October 16.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Beijing’s bullies are on the nose	The Australian	Collapse in trust is not the fault of China’s oppressed people If Beijing’s loathsome cowboy envoys need a measure of how Australians view their propaganda antics and grubby coercion, they need look no further than the annual Lowy Institute Poll, published on Wednesday. China’s authoritarian regime and its elbows-out minions are on the nose. Less than a quarter of Australians trust China to act responsibly in world affairs and a mere 22 per cent express confidence in President Xi Jinping — both figures halving in the past two years to record lows. Our relations with China have been in the deep freeze since the 2018 passage of robust foreign interference laws and banning of Huawei from our 5G network. Those moves were in our national interest. Things took another turn when the Morrison government led the call for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.
China hit back with “wolf warrior” bluster, before lashing out with an 80 per cent tariff on barley, bans on beef producers and a bizarre travel warning to its students to avoid an allegedly unsafe and racist country. Little wonder such bullying and slander are fuelling a grassroots push for less dependency on China: 94 per cent of respondents to the Lowy poll say we need to look for other markets. Mass detention of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and repression in Hong Kong have also hardened views of the Chinese Communist Party, with eight in 10 Australians supporting travel and financial sanctions on officials associated with human rights abuses. Scott Morrison is pushing back at Beijing’s “disinformation”, warning last Friday of a “malicious” campaign of state-sponsored cyber attacks against Australia. The recruitment of former US secretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen to prepare our cyber security strategy is a welcome move.
Few doubt China is behind hacking. In fact, more nations are becoming weary of Beijing’s undiplomatic ploys, theft of intellectual property, debt-trap chicanery, political meddling, economic intimidation and rising militarism. Its defensiveness over the pandemic, and brazen opportunism in playing all angles, are immature. Last month the community of nations called out such dodgy behaviour in a resounding vote on a COVID-19 inquiry at the World Health Assembly. The CCP’s bullying is making enemies. Beijing will pay a price for its belligerence and bad faith, via containment policies, trade diversion and a slide in prestige. Pressure will build within Western nations, including Five Eyes members, to keep firms such as Huawei out of sensitive networks and key infrastructure. Boris Johnson’s apparent willingness to allow Huawei to build a major new “research facility” close to Cambridge is a security risk.
The collapse in citizens’ trust is not the fault of China’s people. Similarly, the 1.2 million Australians with Chinese ancestry should recognise the chill in relations is directly due to Mr Xi’s awful actions. This, too, should be apparent in contemplating the Lowy poll’s findings about Australians’ lack of confidence in US President Donald Trump, despite strong support for the US alliance. Only 51 per cent of respondents trust the US to act responsibly, which is almost a third lower than in 2009. Only one in three Australians has confidence in Mr Trump to do the right thing. It’s a stark reminder of the profound challenges in making foreign policy, with our largest economic partner seen as increasingly hostile and our closest ally perceived as less reliable in what could, as some analysts believe, be a new Cold War. That harsh reality is showing up in Australians feeling more gloomy about security. Only half of those surveyed by the Lowy Institute reported feeling safe, a 28-point drop from 2018. The same proportion feel optimistic about Australia’s economic performance in the next decade — the lowest level recorded in the poll’s 16-year history. As Lowy scholars Alex Oliver and Natasha Kassam wrote on Wednesday, despite the pandemic, recession and souring of relations with China, Australians remain largely positive about globalisation and free trade. “The sentiments we express this year suggest we look to countries we trust, led by leaders we are confident will do the right thing, to work on issues that are important to Australia, as we square up to an uncertain future,” they wrote. It’s time to deepen some ties and nurture new friendships, while staying open to the world and true to our values.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
FROM THE EDITOR	Bay of Plenty Times	Community key in dry timesThe rain was the talk of our towns last weekend and some also witnessed what they thought looked like a small tornado.
It turned out to be a lot of show and not enough flow.
The entire Coromandel has now been declared as officially experiencing a meteorological drought, whereas last week it had only been declared for the northern half of our district.
A reader forwarded a video after she approached the owners of a bach in Whangamata, which was surrounded by verdant lawn. Amid the squirting sprinklers, she asked if the property owners were aware there was a drought.
This week, Fire Chief Jo Adams and his crew from Onemana Rural Fire are still rightly asking everyone to prepare and protect against fire risk as the drought goes on.
The community is responsible because there is no single individual, group or agency that is able to manage all the risks associated with rural fires and the types of fires that could eventuate in this setting.
It comes down to each of us doing our bit and being aware of others — seeing what we’re at risk of losing.
Sometimes there are differing viewpoints, as is the case with the pohutukawa on this week’s front page and the dunes in Whangamata.
It’s a challenge to raise our head above the parapet in a small town, when we see something that is unjust or not altruistic.
Even those of us reporting it can find ourselves aimed at. But the Coastal News is your community voice. Keep story ideas or contributions coming at news@coastalnews.co.nz.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Berejiklian gives a lesson in leadership on Covid-19	The Australian	Competent government has the flexibility to act with compassion Christmas celebrations will be far from normal for residents of Australia’s biggest city this year but the NSW government has shown that compassion does not have to be lost to the pandemic. Rather than a blanket approach like that taken in other states, the Berejiklian government is tackling the northern beaches COVID-19 outbreak with the minimum possible disruption. This has increased the task of government but improved the lot of citizens. The area of most concern, the northern section of the peninsula outbreak, has been identified and isolated. Different measures have been imposed in different areas depending on the perceived threat. It would have been easier to adopt a blanket ban on celebrations and travel, but at much higher economic and social cost. Yet still there are voices calling for a more cautious approach with tougher lockdowns. Their doom-laden expectations, to date, have proven to be overly pessimistic.
While things can change quickly, the results of NSW’s more nuanced approach speak for themselves. The number of new COVID infections recorded daily continues to be low. Only eight new cases were identified in the 24 hours to Wednesday morning from 42,000 tests. As a result, Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a slight easing of restrictions to allow for families to better enjoy the Christmas break. Even in the centre of the lockdown area, households will be able to have five visitors, so long as they live within the declared hotspot. In Sydney overall, households will be allowed 10 guests, not counting children under 12. At this stage, the relaxed measures will be for the immediate Christmas period only. On December 27, existing limits of a maximum of 10 guests including children will be reimposed. So far, with record testing across Sydney, the approach taken by NSW has shown that consideration breeds respect. Residents in hotspots have heeded calls to remain inside. And, unlike the experience in other states, there has been no need for heavy-handed policing to bring the public to heel. One difficulty of the NSW approach is ensuring there is clarity in an increasingly complex message. So far, it appears to be getting through.
Given such efforts, the Premier’s frustration with her interstate counterparts is understandable. State rivalry and a culture of blaming Canberra for state woes is the cheapest form of retail politics. It is played repeatedly by Queensland and Western Australia. Ms Berejiklian has expressed exasperation at state colleagues who have been quick to shut the door on NSW. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk again played State of Origin politics with Sydney’s COVID outbreak on Wednesday, despite the falling numbers. Queensland has been shut to travellers from Greater Sydney and those who are allowed in from elsewhere face hours-long queues to cross the now fortified state border at the Gold Coast. “This has happened in NSW, it’s happened in the northern beaches, we wish them all the very best but we do not want our lifestyle compromised at this point in time,’’ Ms Palaszczuk said. By acting quickly and heavy-handedly on borders, it is Ms Palaszczuk and other premiers who have compromised the lifestyles and choices of Australians all around the nation.
Anthony Albanese has also been quick to play politics with the Sydney COVID outbreak. The Opposition Leader’s call for the vaccine program to be speeded up is a cheap stunt. Given Australia’s very low levels of infection and the lack of pressure on the health system from the pandemic in summer, it makes sense to proceed calmly and gain the benefit and experience of the early rollout of the vaccine in other countries. When a vaccine is available, it must be rolled out in a safe, professional way. Introducing politics to the vaccine program, as Albanese has done, opens the door to division on what should be a bipartisan pandemic response. Labor’s example in rushing through emergency measures, such as the pink batts scheme and the so-called Building the Education Revolution program in the wake of the global financial crisis under Kevin Rudd, does not give confidence that Labor knows best. Lessons to be learned from the handling of the pandemic will be properly analysed in good time. At this stage, NSW does appear to have set the gold standard, having learned the lessons on contact tracing from the Ruby Princess fiasco early on. What is clear is that competent government has the flexibility to act with compassion. NSW has had confidence in its contact-tracing ability and is mindful of the impact of restrictions. Ms Berejiklian has taken the public into her trust; in return, people have responded responsibly. It is a lesson in leadership other premiers would be wise to follow.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Levelling with the public must be the new normal	The Australian	Concealing key details about COVID-19 clusters is not on
The figures tell a deadly story that cannot be swept under the carpet by NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian or anybody else. After the national death toll from COVID-19 reached 21 on Wednesday, Brad Norington revealed on Thursday that close to a quarter of the deceased had been passengers on the cruise ship Ruby Princess. Five passengers, all in their 70s and 80s, died in hospitals in Sydney, Caboolture north of Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart and northwest Tasmania. A sixth passenger died overnight on Wednesday in Toowoomba on the Darling Downs and a woman who died in Orange in NSW was the seventh. Her husband is also in hospital, fighting for his life. The cruise that docked at Sydney’s international passenger terminal on March 19 was also the source of 340 of Australia’s cases of the virus. The question Ms Berejiklian needs to answer is simple. When the liner arrived, who was responsible for letting 2700 passengers disembark without being tested for COVID-19? The public is entitled to know. Whatever responsibility, if any, rests with ship operator Carnival Cruises, governments, primarily at state level, are responsible for community health.
Last week Yoni Bashan revealed that Ms Berejiklian told a confidential partyroom meeting that Australian Border Force officials were ­responsible for the catastrophic decision to release the passengers into the community and that the agency should wear the blame for the risk of contagion. A day later, Australian Border Force Commissioner Michael Outram declared the NSW government was responsible. This was after the ship’s agent reportedly told the NSW Health Department the day before the vessel came into port that 13 of its passengers had been isolated with flu-like symptoms. Yet the state government deemed the vessel “low risk”. Ms Berejiklian has deflected questions about the matter. But she and NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard owe the nation an explanation.
In the battle against coronavirus, the public is being told to accept unprecedented restrictions as “the new normal”, as politicians like to tell us. But the new normal must be a two-way street, with authorities taking responsibility for decisions good and bad and being open. The Ruby Princess episode has been painful; the public knows someone is culpable, be it politician, bureaucrat or law enforcement officer. Thorough inquiries cannot be put off until the COVID-19 crisis passes. In the interests of the public’s confidence in the protective health measures in place, the matter needs to be cleared up as soon as possible. Until it is, the mystery will continue to cause public disquiet.
At least NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller, in addition to his already hefty workload in a time of crisis, has lent some leadership to tackling the problem of cruise ships. The Ruby Princess is one of eight vessels stranded off the Australian coast. And with 200 of its 1056 crew reporting respiratory symptoms, police and medical staff are on board, testing all crew members for the virus. Once the extent of any new outbreak is established, authorities will face difficult decisions.
As Norington’s report showed, clusters are life-and-death problems, with three-quarters of all deaths in Australia from COVID-19 linked to only three sources of infection. These are the Ruby Princess and three other returning cruise ships; the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged-care facility at Macquarie Park in Sydney’s northwest where five elderly people have died; and the haematology and oncology ward of Melbourne’s Alfred Hospital where three people have now died.Adelaide Airport, where Qantas baggage handlers have tested positive to COVID-19 from an unknown source, also has emerged as a cluster, with 17 people infected. Another 100 staff are in quarantine. The ability of the virus to last for several days on some surfaces is a worry for travellers. Extensive contact tracing is under way and SA Health says the first baggage handler became infected about the “first week of March”, indicating the need for searching inquiries. The penchant of governments, companies and other bodies for secrecy over openness is well entrenched. Amid a deadly pandemic that approach is unconscionable, as the Ruby Princess debacle shows.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
US missing in action on vaccine	The Australian	Concerted global co-operation is needed to fight pandemic
Donald Trump is unlikely to find much support for the ho-hum view he expressed in the White House on Friday that we don’t even need a vaccine for COVID-19 to “go away”. “I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests,” he said in comparing COVID-19 with “other viruses and flus” that, he argued, had come and gone. “This is going to go away without a vaccine. It’s going to go away, and we’re not going to see it again,” he insisted. As the coronavirus mutates into even more contagious forms and with America hit harder than any other nation, it is difficult to understand Mr Trump’s insouciance. But it goes a long way towards explaining his ill-judged absence from last week’s important virtual summit of 40 world leaders, including Scott Morrison, at which a remarkable $12.4bn was pledged to speed up and expand global co-operation to find a vaccine.
The summit was intended to be a display of solidarity in fighting the pandemic. Its aim was to achieve the sort of unity that the group of 27 US Republican and Democratic senators and members of the House of Representatives doubtless had in mind when they wrote to our Washington ambassador, Arthur Sinodinos, to express solid support for the Prime Minister’s initiative in seeking an independent investigation into COVID-19. In Mr Trump’s absence from the vaccine summit the 40 leaders took their cue not from him but from Boris Johnson. In contrast to Mr Trump’s flakiness, the British leader described the race for a vaccine as “the most urgent shared endeavour of all our lifetimes”. Mr Morrison, in pledging $352m, was no less forceful, speaking of “a great shared project by the peoples of the world with a clear purpose: to find that vaccine”. French President Emmanuel Macron warned “a race against time is under way”. Japanese leader Shinzo Abe pledged $1.24bn, the single biggest contribution. Other countries backing what was a remarkable display of unity of purpose in the face of the pandemic included Italy, Spain, Canada, Turkey, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel.Mr Trump was not the only major stay-away from the biggest virtual consultation among world leaders since the contagion began. Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang failed to appear, although Beijing did assign an ambassador. Vladimir Putin also kept away. US officials insisted Washington already was providing $3.7bn “in global health, humanitarian and economic assistance towards the COVID-19 response”. But it will be a pity if Mr Trump maintains his dismissive view of a vaccine and the need to demonstrably achieve the closest possible global co-operation to find one. Strong US leadership is imperative in fighting the pandemic. Mr Trump was unwise to stay away. With so many lives dependent on finding a vaccine, it was no occasion for misguided political one-upmanship or pointless scientific nationalism by any country.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
And the winner is ... Test cricket	The Australian	Congratulations, India. We would have liked a different result but the visiting team played better when it mattered, despite painful injuries, rain and playing the final Test on the Gabba wicket pundits said would not suit their style. Day five was a thrill a ball, with the result no foregone conclusion, even well after tea. India’s win by three wickets, late in the day, not only saw them retain the Border-Gavaskar trophy, it ended our 32-year unbeaten streak at the Gabba. Australia, a quality, talented team, will come back stronger from the experience.
After their drubbing at the Adelaide Oval, when all out for 36, India could have thrown in the towel. But they redeemed themselves at the MCG. In Sydney, the teams showed draws can be anything but dull. Plagued by injuries, India’s experienced players fell like ninepins. Their misfortune, however, paved the way for newcomers such as Shubman Gill, 21, to step up. Gill learned to bat on his family farm in Punjab, where the workers threw balls at him for practice. The seesawing series proved yet again that no international sporting contest matches a classic Test series between two competitive teams. Without the Sydney to Hobart yacht race and much of our usual summer tennis, it’s been a compelling bonus for Australian sports fans. Likewise for cricket fans around the world, many of whom are stranded at home by COVID. From Adelaide to Brisbane, via Melbourne and Sydney, the absorbing battles between batsmen and bowlers proved that courage, strategy and confidence are as important as talent at the crease and in the field.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Anti-vax message is a social ill	The Australian	Conspiracy theories take root through peer pressure in online world A striking image from the anti-vaccination demonstrations in state capitals on Saturday was of a pregnant woman wearing a bikini, a unicorn horn and a face mask, and brandishing a sign that said “my body my choice”. Easy to dismiss as the usual rabble in protest-happy Melbourne, where heavy-handed police arrest the working media by mistake. But unicorn woman was far from alone. Thousands of people gathered to demonstrate against a voluntary COVID-19 vaccination scheme because they feared that one day it might be made compulsory or they would be discriminated against for refusing to participate. In Sydney, leading the charge was discredited celebrity chef Pete Evans. In Brisbane, more than 1000 people gathered at the Botanic Gardens before marching through the streets.
The protests are a clear signal that vaccinating the population against the COVID-19 virus is not going to be all smooth sailing. And much of the disruption will have been facilitated by the modern-day social media monopolists who give kooky conspiracy theories fertile ground to propagate. The community reservoir of anti-vaccination sentiment is well studied and understood. In most cases it has not led to public health calamities because herd immunity has been achieved by most people making the decision to vaccinate themselves and their children from formerly catastrophic diseases such as polio, measles and mumps. A widespread breakdown in trust in vaccinations in Samoa in 2019 because of human error did cause a worrying outbreak of measles that threatened to spread throughout the Pacific. Because the COVID-19 vaccine is so new, a high take-up will be required. The newness of the vaccine also means inevitably there will be a lot of unknowns, the conditions needed for herd immunity being one of them.
The list of concerns held by anti-vaccination groups is extensive. The World Health Organisation says common misunderstandings include that the COVID-19 vaccine causes infertility. WHO says there is no truth to this, a rumour that is common to many vaccines. Another rumour is that mRNA vaccines, a new type of vaccine that includes the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19, can change the DNA of recipients. Again untrue, say scientists. WHO says rigorous testing should be enough to convince the public that vaccines are safe to use, but many still choose to believe the messages they receive on social media rather than from official sources.
In scientific circles, anti-vaccination belief is called vaccine hesitancy and it has been widely studied. Peer-reviewed studies say the identity politics associated with vaccine hesitancy is inherently social rather than a matter of pure individual rationality. Before the pandemic, WHO said vaccine hesitancy was judged one of the 10 most notable threats to global health. Research by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-supported Aspen Institute says the spread of vaccine hesitancy comes from having misinformation socially reinforced to the extent that citizens believe it to be credible. It says a significant concern is misinformation that has infiltrated the conversation about vaccinations online and via social media. A study published in February last year demonstrated that people exposed to vaccine content on social media were likelier to be misinformed than those exposed to it on traditional media. To avoid contamination of the public health message, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has pulled government advertising on the vaccine rollout from Facebook. Mr Hunt said on Sunday his department would rely instead on other platforms and traditional media. The issue highlights the need for greater scrutiny of the role social media plays in public information. Yet the Senate’s media diversity inquiry last Friday was unable to identify what a media monopoly was. It’s certainly not something enjoyed by the traditional media. The monopolistic example wrecking public policy objectives on the vaccine rollout is staring committee members in the Facebook.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Victorian outbreaks must not risk nation’s recovery	The Australian	Containing local spikes safeguards the wider economy Much of the damage was done a fortnight ago. Sure, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews urged protesters not to attend the Black Lives Matter march on June 6. But when the event was not stopped, and the tens of thousands of people who broke social-distancing laws were not fined as Victoria Police stood lamely by, many others, fed up with isolation and restrictions, gave up on the rules in disgust. They forgot, or chose to forget, there is no room for complacency. As a result, cases of COVID-19 lurking in the community, partly because of authorities’ ineffective responses to earlier outbreaks, began to spread. The weekend mini-spike in Victoria, 25 new cases announced on Saturday and 19 more on Sunday, is a salutary lesson for all jurisdictions. Yet again, the potential of this stealthy, highly contagious virus to wreak havoc with citizens’ lives and livelihoods has been writ large. It comes as the international situation is deteriorating. On Saturday, the World Health Organisation said the pandemic was accelerating, with more than 150,000 new cases reported within 24 hours, the highest single-day number to date. More than half of the new patients were in the Americas, with many also from South Asia and the Middle East. More than 467,000 people have died from almost nine million cases worldwide.
Victoria has reached “a tipping point’’ as its Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, says. Mr Andrews had no alternative at the weekend but to delay the relaxation of restrictions due to be lifted on Monday. Doing so comes at a high cost, however, for hard-pressed restaurateurs, cafe owners and their staff. As John Ferguson and Rachel Baxendale report, they have spent tens of thousands of dollars stocking up in anticipation of serving 50 customers at a time rather than 20. Business owners’ anger at facing $10,000 fines for letting 21 patrons eat at their well-scrubbed, well-spread-out tables, while Black Lives Matter protesters got off scot-free, is understandable.
Three protesters have tested positive, and a fourth case is linked to one of them. But the bigger problem was the signal sent by the attitude of authorities to the march. Mr Andrews is right not to rule out lockdowns in the worst-affected suburbs of Melbourne; they could be a means to spare the rest of the state, especially regional areas that are free of the virus, from further economic hardship. Nor should the latest outbreaks, being relatively isolated to a couple of outer Melbourne suburbs, be allowed to delay the opening up of the rest of the nation, including state borders. Jobs, small businesses, living standards, community wellbeing and families’ and individuals’ mental health are all at stake, as well as the nation’s economic future. Queensland Health Minister Steven Miles has suggested reopening of the state’s borders could be delayed beyond July 10 because of fears of a dreaded second wave of coronavirus in Victoria. Such head-in-the-sand isolationism has never been justified on medical grounds or called for by the commonwealth’s most senior medical officers. Border closures and the clamp on interstate travel are costing about 5000 jobs a week and shrinking the nation’s economic output by $84m a day. Economic analysis reported last week shows Queensland is the worst-affected state, losing more than 1000 jobs a week and $147m in economic activity. That is untenable.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan is also using Victoria’s predicament to try to justify his keeping WA’s borders locked. As Scott Morrison said last month, we can’t keep Australia under the doona. Emerging from the pandemic was inevitably going to see breakouts of COVID-19. But Australians can take comfort that our health system has the expertise, facilities and resources to cope. Testing, tracking and containing outbreaks is crucial. So is learning from mistakes. In Victoria, the breakout of 11 cases across nine households in Keilor Downs, in Melbourne’s outer northwest, arises from cases reported by the Victorian government last month. Comprehensive, localised case management to prevent local spikes becoming a second wave, endangering lives and the national economy, must be the priority of all states.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Preserving Australian way in time of draconian laws	The Australian	Coronavirus imperils lives, livelihoods and our freedoms
Draco was an Athenian of the 7th century BC who drew up a code of laws known for their severity. Nearly every violation was a capital crime. Centuries later, the orator Demades said Draco’s code was written in blood. The brand has been defined down over millennia. We often hear about draconian laws, without anyone being put to death for breaking them. Speaking on Sunday about social distancing to contain the coronavirus, Scott Morrison warned he “may have to take far more draconian measures” in terms of lockdowns and the like. Sure, that’s crisis rhetoric. But we can’t help but be troubled every time we hear governments speak about new restrictions on liberties, when we experience the onset of surveillance and feel the hefty, tightening grip of the national security state.
The advice from the medical experts of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, guiding the emergency response by governments, is to impose progressively harsher social-distancing measures. The aim is to flatten the rate of COVID-19 infections, spreading the caseload across a longer period to reduce pressure on intensive care facilities. Restrictions on travel, trading, socialising and schooling give authorities a chance to put resources in place ahead of a surge in infections. Australians grumble but accept such intrusive measures are necessary as long as they are based on facts, are transparent and explained clearly, and carefully balance competing interests. Let’s not destroy the village to save it.
In this vein, we must be vigilant about protecting the freedoms that are the Australian way of life. On Tuesday, we noted the success Singapore has had in containing the spread of COVID-19. Even at the best of times, the six million residents of the city-state consent to the harsh social control and surveillance by an autocratic government. Although it was quick to close borders and impose quarantine, Singapore also has used invasive contact-tracing procedures to create detailed logs of the movement of infected people. A new smartphone app called TraceTogether will allow officials to record virtually every encounter a person has, as phones exchange Bluetooth signals when they come within 2m of each other.
You would hope privacy breaches on this scale would be anathema to our open culture and vibrant democracy. Before you say Google, Facebook and the rise of what one Harvard theorist calls “surveillance capitalism”, think again. The AHPPC now has flagged measures to monitor closely those in quarantine and isolation, including phone checks and mobile phone tracking. Such an intrusive move has context, some would say justification, after the reckless NSW government allowed infected cruise passengers to disembark from the Ruby Princess last Thursday. Like the debacle at Bondi Beach that directly led to the shuttering of the nation’s hospitality industry and mass job losses, negligence on this scale invites desperate, damaging measures that chip away at our prized freedoms.
Again, there are delicate trade-offs at play. Liberty is recalibrated in times of national crisis, such as wars and pandemics. In 2015 parliament enacted the Biosecurity Act. As legal scholar George Williams wrote on Monday: “It provides a formidable and truly remarkable set of powers for the federal government to navigate this crisis.” Government officials can impose a control order on any person displaying one or more symptoms of COVID-19, as well as any person with whom they have been in contact. Those subject to a control order can be compelled to name people they’ve been in contact with, must take a medical examination or provide body samples, and must submit to treatment. After the Governor-General declared a week ago that “a human biosecurity emergency exists”, Professor Williams argued Health Minister Greg Hunt has the unfettered power normally found in dictatorships. Attorney-General Christian Porter acknowledged these laws were “strange and foreign to many Australians”.
Traditional checks and balances, for now, are out the window. Australians in every era have been ambivalent about authority. Citizens will comply in good faith during the COVID-19 fight but will continually ask questions and expect straight answers from leaders and officials. Yet we worry about the overhang of draconian measures first sold as temporary impositions. After 9/11, we experienced a loss of liberty as governments prosecuted the war on terror. Security agencies were scaled up. Screening at airports and homeland security red tape imposed costs — in lost time, higher taxes, inconveniences and forfeited opportunities. Strict laws curtailed a range of freedoms.But Australia became complacent. The creep of the national security state also has eaten away at press freedom, making news reporting a crime in some instances and limiting a citizen’s right to know what governments are doing. We are in a protracted fight, with lives lost and threatened, the social fabric stretched, an economy suffocating. The Prime Minister assures us Australia will emerge from the pandemic united and stronger. That promised land should be more open, with liberties restored. Today’s emergency controls, written in blood, must also be washed away.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Coate hotel inquiry closing in	The Australian	Cox Plate debacle shows worst restrictions should be lifted Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has much to be sorry about over the past seven months, especially the deaths of almost 800 people during the second wave of COVID-19. Almost all of that wave has been linked to the state’s failed quarantine scheme at the Rydges and Stamford Plaza hotels. But Mr Andrews’ repeated apologies and humiliating backdown over the fiasco surrounding the Cox Plate at Moonee Valley on Saturday should have been avoidable. Moonee Valley Racing Club’s proposal to allow 500 owners and connections of horses to attend Saturday’s 100th Cox Plate deserved the initial approval it received. As Mr Andrews said, it “went through a normal process, it was deemed safe … they would have been spread out’’.
Racing Victoria, the state Racing Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton and his team and Mr Andrews’ eight-member community crisis cabinet all signed off on the MVRC’s 300-page proposal. It was evidently safe and sensible.
Instead of withdrawing permission three hours after it was granted, Mr Andrews might have done better to address the root causes of the public anger the decision provoked. The real problem is that the severe restrictions still in place in Melbourne need to be relaxed. Measures that are now glaringly disproportionate to the state’s COVID caseload include the ongoing closure of retailers, pubs, restaurants and many workplaces. Limiting weddings to five people, including the couple; keeping funerals to 10; allowing indoor religious services only for filming, with five participants, and restricting outdoor services to six people, including a celebrant, is causing angst and anger at a time new daily infections have fallen to single digits. After a dismal winter, it is time to open up the economy as much as possible.
The Cox Plate controversy comes as the Andrews government falls deeper into disarray over the quarantine hotel inquiry. After revelations that he decided to withhold a critical email from the inquiry, Professor Sutton did not appear at the Premier’s press conference on Wednesday. The email appears to contradict Professor Sutton’s sworn evidence that he was not told about the use of private security guards until months after the scheme began. On March 27, he was copied in on an email from public servant Braedan Hogan to federal officials that said “private security is being contracted to provide security at the hotels with escalation arrangements to (Victoria Police) as needed”. Professor Sutton replied: “Thanks so much, Braedan”.
While problematic for Professor Sutton, the email trail does not suggest he was responsible for engaging the private security guards instead of using police and Australian Defence Force officers. The mystery of who was responsible is the key question at the heart of the inquiry headed by former judge Jennifer Coate. Mr Andrews confirmed on Wednesday that he has been asked by the inquiry to provide more information in an affidavit after the resignations of Department of Premier and Cabinet secretary Chris Eccles and health minister Jenny Mikakos. Mr Andrews told the inquiry he did not know who decided to hire private security guards to oversee returned travellers. Ms Mikakos, Jobs Minister Martin Pakula and Police Minister Lisa Neville also pleaded ignorance, as did Mr Eccles, Professor Sutton and Victoria Police chiefs. It may be advisable, as we have argued before, for witnesses to be recalled.
As Damon Johnston and Ewin Hannan write on Thursday, there is an emerging view in Melbourne legal circles that several inquiry witnesses may be in breach of the Victorian Inquiries Act 2014. The act lists as an offence making “false or misleading statements or produce false or misleading documents’’. Being found guilty carries big fines and jail terms. It would be up to retired judge Coate to refer any potential cases to prosecutors. She is due to report on November 6. But with important ground still to cover, the reporting date might need to be extended.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Beijing’s assault on rule of law	The Australian	Crackdown in Hong Kong means China cannot be trusted
If China’s leaders feel in the least bit abashed by global criticism of their handling of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak they’re not showing it. The roundup in Hong Kong on Saturday of 15 of the city’s most esteemed citizens, all prominent democracy advocates, showed instead, as US Attorney-General William Barr said, “how antithetical the values of the Chinese Communist Party are to those we share in Western liberal democracies”. Among those arrested for their alleged part in last year’s massive student-led pro-democracy demonstrations were, remarkably, the eminent, 81-year-old lawyer and widely admired “Father of Democracy” in the city, Martin Lee, 72-year-old fellow lawyer Margaret Ng, 71-year-old newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai and several former legislators. At any time, arresting Hong Kongers of such stature would be seen as a highly provocative move by Beijing. But when the city is battling coronavirus — which has helped quell the protest movement — that is even more the case.
No wonder the former colony’s last British governor, Chris Patten, declared: “It becomes ever more clear, week by week and day by day, that Beijing is determined to throttle Hong Kong. The world should make clear how this further undermines any residual trust that we still have in the Chinese Communist dictatorship.” Mr Patten accused Chinese President Xi Jinping of seeking to “destroy Hong Kong’s way of life”. Hong Kong pro-democracy leader Joshua Wong tweeted: “When all countries are now busy combating #coronavirus, the authoritarian regime of #China is now clamping down (further) on democracy movements in #Hong Kong.” Mr Lee, who previously has never been arrested, was the main author of Hong Kong’s Basic Law, effectively its constitution as a Special Administrative Region of China. After being released on bail he said: “After months of witnessing youths being arrested and prosecuted while I stayed out of it, I actually felt guilty. I feel proud to walk the road of democracy with these outstanding youths.” That indicates how far Beijing has departed from the views of even the drafters of the Basic Law.At least if Mr Lee or any of the others arrested do serve jail time it will be in Hong Kong. Last year’s protests erupted when Chief Executive Carrie Lam tried to ram through laws that would have allowed Beijing to extradite anyone to the mainland, thereby achieving the Chinese Communist Party’s ambition to destroy Hong Kong’s legal autonomy. Despite that setback, Beijing remains determined to further undermine Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems”. The arrest of the 15 prominent citizens is seen as part of a wider drive to impose new security laws aimed at further tightening Chinese control. Beijing may have calculated it will be able to get away with the arrests while the world is preoccupied with COVID-19. It must not be allowed to do so. The arrests, like its brazen deception over coronavirus, show, as Mr Barr said, the CCP “cannot be trusted”.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Markets, technology key to low carbon transition	The Australian	Creative entrepreneurs should capitalise on opportunities
In its scoping paper on energy and climate change policy, the Business Council of Australia — the voice of more than 100 of the nation’s largest corporations — argues that the economy’s energy transition needs to be driven by technology that “will not only get us to a net-zero emissions future but will also create new jobs, opportunities and industries, and maintain Australia’s competitiveness”. With healthy profits to be made from harnessing technology to deliver affordable, reliable power, energy entrepreneurs, including companies represented by the BCA, should take the long view, lead the way and invest. Those with the vision and flair to do so would find no shortage of overseas partners to inject capital in viable projects, as coal and other resource industries have done for generations. Based on calculations by the EU, the BCA paper argues new investment of at least $22bn will be needed every year until 2050 to deliver net-zero emissions. To put the figure in perspective, the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project proposes to spend about $5bn across five years.
That is a tall order. But if a sustainable transition to lower and ultimately zero emissions is to be achieved, investment and market efficiencies — rather than taxpayer-funded subsidies and centralised decision-making — will get us there. The vexed question of new coalmines and coal-fired power plants, for example, would be best resolved not on the whims of politicians but on technological progress with carbon capture and storage and whether banks and investors support them financially.
Investment in renewables and gas should be encouraged by new figures from the International Energy Agency showing clean energy transitions are well under way. Coal-fired power generation in advanced economies declined by nearly 15 per cent last year, causing big falls in emissions in the US, Europe and Japan, as Graham Lloyd wrote a week ago. That decline offset emissions rises in developing countries, where more coal-fired power stations were built. The changes in advanced economies were driven by an increasing switch from coal to gas, wind and solar energy, and the restart of nuclear generation. The IEA said natural gas produced more electricity than coal for the first time ever and wind-powered electricity almost matched coal-fired electricity.
The growing importance of gas in advanced economies overseas underlines the economic and environmental irrationality of NSW holding up the Santos Narrabri gas project for almost 10 years and Victoria banning all gas exploration. Geoscience Australia estimates Victoria has potentially recoverable resources of shale and tight gas onshore to meet 40 years of east coast domestic demand. The BCA report notes that gas will be an important transition fuel in electricity production, as backup to renewable power generation. The BCA says development of new fields in Victoria, the Northern Territory and the Cooper Basin should occur. In response to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission’s warning that high gas prices are forcing factories to shut and companies to go into liquidation, recalcitrant state administrations should remove their restrictions to open the way for an expansion of private investment in the sector. The role of government, as the ACCC said in its report released on Monday, is to provide infrastructure to move gas from Queensland and the Northern Territory to other states.
A crunch point on carbon is coming, with moves afoot for a new climate change plan to impose net-zero emissions by 2050 on participants at the UN climate summit in Glasgow in November. Scott Morrison’s instincts to avoid signing up to such an erosion of national sovereignty are right and reflect the outlook of most Australians. Like the BCA, The Australian has long supported a price on carbon and trading emissions permits as the path to least-cost abatement. But more than a decade of poisonous politics and false starts precludes that option for now.As the Morrison government recognises, technological advancement will be essential to significant carbon abatement. The question of who will pay — taxpayers or industry — is critical. Aside from budgetary concerns, governments picking winners has a disastrous history in Australia; look no further than the tens of billions of dollars handed to car manufacturers for decades. Subsidies for renewable energy have already cost taxpayers and consumers billions of dollars. At a time when many renewable schemes are set to wind up, demands for cutting emissions are increasing and the Victorian moratorium on conventional gas exploration is due to end in June, technological advances and markets offer the business sector an important opportunity to capitalise on Australians’ demand for cleaner, affordable energy. Governments must help create the conditions by way of infrastructure and minimising red and green tape. The momentum for sustainable, greener energy needs to come from business and markets. They should get on with it.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Focus on demand ignores it’s the supply side, stupid	The Australian	Cutting rates won’t address entrenched economic problems
Financial markets have spoken, if not screamed. More cuts to official interest rates — now a record low 0.75 per cent — have been locked in by investors. So say overnight index swap rates, forward scouts of cash-rate movements. The markets now are expecting an extreme monetary response, given the central bank has said “unconventional” policy or quantitative easing will kick in when the cash rate hits 0.25 per cent.
The Reserve Bank of Australia board, however, should ignore speculators when it meets on Tuesday. What’s the point of trying to juice up demand this way when monetary policy has run its race? All the RBA would do is pump up asset prices, especially housing in our largest cities. Not an ideal result. Another rate cut would send a message to consumers that things were really crook. It would be an act of self-harm.
The coronavirus outbreak has spooked investors well before it has taken a chunk out of the real economy. Tourism and education services are in the frontline, suffering an income hit. On Wednesday, national accounts are likely to show retail has been weak for a year. Agriculture has been affected by the drought, bushfires and floods. The impact of natural disasters on export sales and employment won’t show up in official figures until later in the year. Yet anecdotal evidence is mounting that the COVID-19 epidemic is disrupting supply chains across a broad front of industries, most of which are dependent on Chinese inputs. The world’s factory is in shutdown mode, with China’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index plummeting to a record low last month. Our building and construction industry — large and small firms — will soon experience a sharp contraction in materials supply.
As external shocks go, the evolving crisis is about supply disruption. Unlike the global financial crisis, the issue is not liquidity. Plus there’s nothing the RBA can do to calm global fears. Again, the board should hold fire, just in case the economy tanks and confidence takes another dive in coming months.
Scott Morrison’s language has evolved on the evaporating surplus and need for stimulus. The Prime Minister does not favour the post-GFC cash splashes used by Labor. But there is room for a swift fiscal response for the most affected industries, with Treasury developing plans for assistance that is “targeted, modest and scalable”. That means more support for businesses and workers in the tourism sector, which received a recovery package in January following the Black Summer bushfires. For now, the government is resisting additional funds to universities.
As we have argued in this space, a budget in balance gives Canberra a decent starting position to respond. It’s just a pity that the fiscal consolidation under the Coalition — after Labor’s policy excesses and failures across two terms — has been so timid and tardy. The greater lament is that the political class as a whole has been sitting on its hands, living off the fat of the reform era of the 1980s and 90s. Of course, our capital’s elected cohort is sick of hearing about the golden days of reform by Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, John Howard and Peter Costello. The truth is we’ve become used to rising living standards via the surge in national income from the rise of China, rather than lifting our economic game. The current crisis exposes this drift.
Nothing reveals this more starkly than a poor productivity performance. It’s what keeps even serial optimist Philip Lowe awake, although the letters QE soon may figure in the RBA governor’s nocturnal deliberations. We have lost ground in the productivity stakes through a lack of investment, skills, risk-taking and fresh ideas. Our supply side, more than demand side, needs urgent attention. That means less red tape to get projects going, more flexibility at workplaces and incentives for research, among a host of things Productivity Commission officials have listed in a reform road map. The mantra should be “doing things better” with our precious capital and labour, not flogging old tools and ill-equipped workers in the same old ways.Perhaps this will be the crisis that serves as the wake-up call to both sides of politics to develop game plans that look beyond one term in office or the next election. If we had more dynamic businesses, a diversified customer base for exports, a more competitive tax regime and skilled workers able to chase opportunities wherever they may emerge, we’d be hitting this challenge with revenue in the bank, fuel in the tank and policy options up our sleeve.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Mass confusion deepens Victorian Covid damage	The Australian	Daniel Andrews must come clean on strategy and mistakes If Victoria were a country, the increase in its COVID-19 caseload since late June, 570 per cent, would rank as the 13th-highest in the world, slightly worse than Madagascar, Angola and Libya. A desperate situation calls for desperate measures. But however long it takes for transmissions to taper off — and modelling varies on that point — the costs and pain of stage-four restrictions are being exacerbated as the “state of desperation” degenerated into a state of confusion before and during their first full day. Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox summed up the frustrations of employers and workers on Thursday when he said business owners were experiencing “mass confusion” about who could operate. Confusion was rife in warehousing, manufacturing, the building trade and other sectors about the permitted worker scheme. Lack of supporting documentation from government and slow updates on some government sites were problematic for businesses. Terminology such as “common sense will prevail” was little comfort for business owners facing $20,000 fines or trying to explain to a police officer why they were open. EY chief executive Tony Johnson said confusion in the Victorian business community in the 48 hours before the stage-four lockdown was unprecedented, with serious concerns centred on supply chains and distribution issues.
In March, during the first wave of the nation’s coronavirus crisis, we pointed out to all governments that prompt and clear communication was vital to encourage public compliance with COVID safety measures. The same principle is even more important now as businesses across Victoria seek to comply with the stage-four economic lockdown. Mixed and inconsistent messaging has left many businesses, workers and even lawyers confused. As a consequence, the community can be more vulnerable to the virus’s effects.
At this stage, Victoria cannot afford any more errors. Premier Daniel Andrews was frank in his mea culpa on Thursday about his government’s botched hotel quarantine scheme: “Mistakes have been made and I will own those errors.” So he should. We acknowledge that the challenges he is grappling with daily are immense. That is why he must not try to operate as a one-man band. Delegation is vital to good government at the best of times and has never been more important than now. Transparency also is important. For instance, the news that a man in his 30s had died from the virus sent fear through parts of the community. Earlier in the pandemic some states released information about pre-existing health conditions of those who succumbed to the virus. Doing so now in Victoria would help the public put the situation in perspective. While people of all ages must take the issue seriously, unnecessary anxiety is not conducive to public morale.
As a priority, Mr Andrews needs to marshal his economic ministers, especially Tim Pallas, and those responsible for transport, industry and agriculture to engage with key sectors of the economy. The practical experience of industries and workers should help inform government decision-making and regulations. Such input should help minimise the impact of stage-four restrictions on business, jobs, supply chains and consumers.
On Wednesday night, the heads of some of Australia’s biggest companies, including the major supermarket chains, discussed their concerns with the Victorian Treasurer. The meeting, reportedly came about after direct intervention by Josh Frydenberg. Business leaders, unsurprisingly, demanded greater clarity from the state government about the restrictions. Supermarket operators warned Scott Morrison that the lockdown across Victoria would lead to national shortages and fresh panic buying, and could force more frequent visits to the shops, which is contrary to the need of public health. Their concerns, including over meat supply, need to be addressed. The benefits of consultation were clear, as Ewin Hannan reports, when the threat by builders to shut most of the state’s construction industry was averted after the Andrews government agreed to allow specialist trades and equipment to move between building sites up to three times a week. The nation is facing its third consecutive quarter of negative growth, with the Victorian lockdown to slash $10bn to $12bn from national quarterly output by the end of September. The Andrews government has no margin for error.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Confident leaders have more faith in their teams	The Australian	Daniel Andrews promises Victoria more uncertainty over lockdowns
The only guarantee for Victorians who were released from a five-day COVID-19 lockdown at midnight on Wednesday is that another statewide lockdown could be just around the corner. As businesses count their losses and citizens prepare to resume social activity, Premier Daniel Andrews is using mind games and trickery to defend past actions while warning of more disruption to come. “I can provide no guarantee (another lockdown won’t happen) because I am not prepared to present to the Victorian community this is over,” Mr Andrews said. In short, Victorians can be confident not that they have a government in control but one that will continue to make drastic decisions that affect their lives and livelihoods.
Many in Victoria no doubt will accept Mr Andrews’ claims that they have been saved from the possibility of greater confinement and loss should the lockdown not have happened. But the hard numbers are in. During the five-day lockdown period there were six locally acquired cases, all of which were linked to the Holiday Inn outbreak and well contained.
Mr Andrews insists the lockdown was worth it, and that it was impossible to know how fast and far the UK variant would have spread around Melbourne had the city not had a “fourth ring” of protection provided by the lockdown. But as Health Editor Natasha Robinson writes on Thursday, the words of Victoria’s Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, give the lie to the Premier’s theory.
Professor Sutton said he was confident that the state’s traditional public health response of testing, tracing and isolating was capable of containing the coronavirus, whether a variant of concern or not.
“Victoria’s contact tracers have faced a challenge and they were up to it,” he said. “For every positive case, they traced 66 close contacts and placed them into isolation, erecting an iron-clad ‘third ring’ around the virus.” Professor Sutton said this reinforced that the three-ring principle of test, trace and isolate was the right way to go, and it could deal with variants of concern as well.
Epidemiologists say Victoria should now have confidence in its contact tracing, and that the UK variant does not move at “lightning speed”, quicker than contact tracers can keep up, despite what Mr Andrews has said to justify the latest harsh lockdown.
Mr Andrews’ vaudevillian performances at his daily press conference on the pandemic have become a masterclass in distraction, slapdown and spin. By submitting the people of Victoria to a daily theatre of psychological game-playing, Mr Andrews is claiming compassion but looking after his own interests first. This is the opposite of grown-up government and good leadership. Despite the positive news from health advisers on the latest outbreak, Mr Andrews seems unwilling or unable to trust the advice of experts. This is consistent with our view that past failure on hotel quarantine has limited the Victorian leadership’s ability to deal objectively with the facts. Fundamentally, all of the decisions made by Mr Andrews are being made under the influence of the trauma of last year’s hotel quarantine disaster that resulted in 800 lost lives. Nobody could ever wish on a society a repeat of 800 deaths, 20,000 infections and 112 days of lockdown. However, as we have stated previously, rather than panic, state leaders should have confidence in the changes they make to ensure those outcomes do not happen again.
Leadership is never risk free, but good leaders must be prepared to make brave decisions. Clearly, the NSW government took risks in its decisions to control the recent Sydney outbreak with limited lockdowns and faith in contact tracing. As a result, the NSW economy has continued to rebound strongly. Mr Andrews’ actions suggest he is interested only in eliminating all risk. As we report today, the economic cost of the five-day lockdown has been substantial. Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra said business had missed out on what could have been the busiest weekend of trading for a decade because of the lockdown. He estimated losses at between $500m and $1bn. Economists have warned that leaving the door open to stop-start lockdowns in future saps confidence and will lead to Victoria slipping further behind other states.
Victorian Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien has struggled for attention but his points on the latest lockdown are well made. “We can’t keep having this yoyo where we open, then close, then open again. Schools are open, schools are closed. Businesses are open, businesses are closed. Masks on, masks off. We just need to get it right,” Mr O’Brien said. “If the government gets hotel quarantine right and they get contact tracing right, we can get on with our lives. NSW has done it, NSW is doing it. That’s the model for Victoria: good contact tracing, good hotel quarantine, proportionate responses, stay open. That’s where we need to be.” Mr Andrews needs to relax the politics and gamesmanship of the pandemic and reflect on the longer-term societal cost of his actions, have more confidence in the future, and not let it happen again.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Hong Kong diktat a mark of China’s wilful outlook	The Australian	Daniel Andrews was not elected to determine foreign policy The “deep concern” about China’s assault on Hong Kong’s democratic freedoms expressed by Foreign Minister Marise Payne and her UK and Canadian counterparts is important. As the ministers said, making such a law on Hong Kong’s behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary undermines the principle of “one country, two systems’’, under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy. Donald Trump and the European Union also criticised China’s move. The comments from Western leaders drew an angry response from China, accusing its critics of “bandit logic’’.
In an exclusive interview with foreign editor Greg Sheridan on Monday, one of the most influential figures in American foreign policy, US senator Marco Rubio, says the Chinese Communist Party is using its current dispute with Australia to intimidate other nations and stop them from criticising Beijing over its handling of the COVID-19 crisis. Senator Rubio, who is acting chairman of the powerful Senate intelligence committee, is undoubtedly correct. And a united front between Australia, Britain, Canada and other democracies over China’s intolerable violation of the “one country, two systems” principle will send a stronger message than a single country speaking out.
Draconian new security laws to be imposed on Hong Kong after rubberstamping by President Xi Jinping’s National People’s Congress undermine the Chinese Communist Party’s pledge to maintain “one country, two systems’’ for 50 years when it assumed control in 1997.
Twenty-seven years ahead of that schedule — at a time when the world is preoccupied with fighting COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan — Mr Xi has chosen his moment. After failing for more than a year to snuff out Hong Kong’s democratic movement with tear gas, bullets, mass arrests and prosecutions, Mr Xi has cast aside the deference of his predecessors and shown his disdain for the agreement.
He is imposing a “rule-by-diktat” security law that will allow China’s feared security agencies to take effective control of Hong Kong. They will enforce bans on “secessionist or subversive activity”, the organising of so-called “terrorist acts” and “activities of foreign and external interference”. It may not be quite the full-scale military and administrative takeover of the former colony feared by democrats, but it is not far short of it. It will signal the end of freedom, including press freedom. The fate of leaders such as Hong Kong’s “father of democracy”, internationally respected barrister Martin Lee, 81, arrested in April with 14 other democrats and charged with “sedition, subversion and the theft of state secrets”, looks even grimmer in light of Mr Xi’s takeover. As the colony’s last British governor, Chris Patten, said on Saturday, “we are seeing a new Chinese dictatorship … the Hong Kong people have been betrayed by China’’. China, he said, cheats to twist things in its favour, and those who point it out can expect “wolf warrior’’ diplomats trying to bully them into submission. The trend will make the world less stable, as Mr Patten fears.
Amid concerns China has exploited the economic chaos caused by the coronavirus, Boris Johnson has made the right call to claw back Huawei’s involvement in Britain’s 5G network to zero within three years. The decision is welcome. But Mr Johnson should have responded sooner to the concerns of Australia, the US and other allies in the Five Eyes intelligence arrangement, as well as his own backbench. He has been warned repeatedly about the grave security implications of Huawei’s participation in the network.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and his Treasurer, Tim Pallas, also need to become more prudent. Asked on Sunday whether he agreed with Mr Pallas that some of the federal government’s rhetoric had been seen to vilify China, Mr Andrews said: “Yes. Any other issues?’’ He should have repudiated his Treasurer on the matter. As Scott Morrison says, states should respect the commonwealth’s role in setting foreign relations. Mr Andrews’s foolish embrace of a Belt and Road agreement contradicts national government policy and federal Labor policy, as Sheridan wrote on Saturday. It sets a state against the nation. And any Chinese investment in Victoria will need Foreign Investment Review Board approval, which Mr Andrews cannot guarantee. Amid the health, economic and strategic repercussions from COVID-19, China is at a critical point in its relationship with the democratic world. Its handling of Hong Kong will be a critical test. Mr Xi would do well to reflect on the words of the senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, Maya Wang, who said on Friday that watching the fate of Hong Kong being decided in Beijing was like watching the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 — “that same feeling of powerlessness, the sadness about the rights of people being trampled upon”.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Pell’s High Court acquittal revives reasonable doubt	The Australian	Decision asks serious questions of Victoria’s legal processes
The unanimous decision by the High Court of Australia to quash five child sexual abuse convictions of Cardinal George Pell is an emphatic verdict rooted in evidence, judicial precedents and the law. As the court said, there is “a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted because the evidence did not establish guilt to the requisite standard of proof”. That fundamental standard is beyond reasonable doubt, and the judgment runs through the court’s reasoning in clear, dispassionate detail. The court overturned the verdict of a second jury trial before the County Court of Victoria in December 2018 and a split decision by the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria last August.
Our judicial system is not perfect; no human system can ever be. But it has entrenched checks and balances, combining procedural fairness and reasonable review, and the promise that every person is treated equally. In this historic case, which has split the nation, we have seen the system’s manifest flaws but also its startling ability to right itself. When he was found guilty of abusing two choirboys at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne in 1996 and 1997, some saw the nation’s most senior cleric and high-ranking Vatican official as the scapegoat for decades of horrific child sexual abuse by Catholic clergy. For victims of that abuse, Tuesday’s decision will rekindle the traumas and turmoil at the hands of those who once had an exalted place in society.
Absolution and salvation are ecclesiastical terms, thus not the province of judges. Still, the decision is vindication for Cardinal Pell, who has been incarcerated since March last year. In a statement he said he did not want his acquittal to add “to the hurt and bitterness so many feel”.
But he was also defiant, noting his “trial was not a referendum on the Catholic Church; nor a referendum on how church authorities in Australia dealt with the crime of pedophilia in the church”. It was a trial over whether he committed specific, in his words, “awful crimes”.
But the acrimony and lynch mob hostility won’t subside; regrettably, our culture supercharges them. Cardinal Pell is a divisive figure: a charismatic, powerful, conservative cultural warrior, singled out as the man who must take responsibility for decades of child sexual abuse by Catholic clergy. For many in law enforcement, the media and the outrage industry, he is beyond redemption. The nation’s most senior judges also have validated last August’s dissenting view of Mark Weinberg, Australia’s most experienced criminal appeal court judge.
Coming after the Lawyer X debacle, Tuesday’s decision highlights serious deficiencies in Victorian justice. It also raises a litany of questions. One of the first is why police launched the “get Pell” Operation Tethering in 2013, reportedly before they received any complaint against him. The police strategy of effectively advertising for complaints about the cardinal in the media was extraordinary. Later came the issue of charges. Anybody familiar with how cathedrals operate on Sundays knew the improbability of anybody having the chance to abuse two children in the priests’ sacristy immediately after mass. Key issues of timing and opportunity rested on the unquestioned evidence of honest witnesses. As lawyer and Jesuit priest Frank Brennan writes, “the tragedy of this case for everyone, including victims and complainants (and most especially this complainant), is that an ordinary police investigation would have highlighted these problems with the complainant’s account”.
In May 2017, we reported the state’s Office of Public Prosecutions had twice returned briefs of evidence on the case to Victoria Police, which made the decision to charge Cardinal Pell. As to the two trials — the second was needed after the jury in the first failed to reach a verdict — Victoria should join NSW in allowing high-profile criminal matters to be heard by a judge alone. Judges, at least, should be above the baying mob. “Even if he didn’t do this he deserves to be punished,” was a common sentiment heard inside the court’s public gallery. The definitive judgment by the nation’s highest court reaffirms the importance of the presumption of innocence, one of the cornerstones of our justice system. Like Justice Weinberg, the High Court decided that any jury acting rationally must have had a reasonable doubt.
The Pell saga lacked transparency, with a media blackout on reporting proceedings of the two trials, due to the possibility of a further trial on separate charges. Another problem, as Chris Merritt writes, was critically important evidence about the psychological problems of the complainant was withheld from juries. That suggests laws with the intention of protecting those who claim to be victims of sexual assault have gone too far. For the good of victims and complainants, Victoria’s OPP and police must review their procedures. The initial response by Premier Daniel Andrews, that he believes “every single victim and survivor of child sex abuse”, suggests legal reform for dealing with such cases may be a slow train coming in Victoria.After years of wicked revelations about unspeakable crimes, including harrowing testimonies by victims to the royal commission, church leaders are finally recognising past failings to protect children have left citizens outraged. How could they not see? It’s a wound that will never heal for many. As Scott Morrison said of the decision, “mere discussion of these topics brings back great hurt” for victims. And when such issues are raised “my thoughts are always with them’’. Yet the final legal arbiter in our system has made its decision and, as the Prime Minister said, “that must be respected”.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Facts not fallacies critical to good policy and debate	The Australian	Decisions on economics and climate need logic, not emotion
Progressive, woke activists have much in common with Hanrahan, bush poet John O’Brien’s pessimist, who, in “accents all forlorn’’, lamented “We’ll all be rooned’’. In the lap of luxury at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Prince Charles demanded “a new economic model or the planet will burn’’. The heir to the throne — whose rhetoric is prompting even rusted-on monarchists to reconsider their future allegiances — greeted habitual truant Greta Thunberg at the alpine resort. The teenager goaded political and business leaders for their “inactivity’’ that she claimed was “fuelling the flames … by the hour’’. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, in contrast, acquitted himself well, basing his defence of Australia’s policies on facts not fallacies. The proposition pushed by some — that Australia was not committed to effective action to cut emissions — was false, he said. Climate change was making things worse. But Australia, a huge continent, had a history of extreme weather. Two years ago, then- prime minister Malcolm Turnbull made a similar, valid point: “You can’t attribute any particular event, whether it’s a flood or fire or a drought or a storm to climate change.” Since then, unfortunately, the facts and science that should underpin discussion and policies have been overshadowed by emotionalism and opportunism. Vile, wild statements by the likes of Greens MP Adam Bandt, who tweeted on Sunday that “Scott Morrison is a threat to life. We must rise up against this terrible gov’t with a fury that matches the intensity of these terrible fires’’, are unconscionable and irrational.
For some industries, such as tourism, false and misleading claims about the impact of bushfires have created a new set of serious problems, threatening small businesses, jobs and local economies. Enterprises in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, hundreds of kilometres from firefronts, are reporting cancellations and major downturns in bookings. Misinformation — like false claims that the Great Barrier Reef is “dying’’ — has gained currency online in the northern hemisphere especially, exacerbating the impact of the fires on tourism.
For the sake of communities, families and individuals, policy making and debate about political, social, economic and environmental challenges must be grounded in facts and knowledge, not prejudice and exaggeration. In the economic sphere, business and consumer confidence, both key ingredients in investment, growth and job creation, are under assault from an unlikely source. The Bank of International Settlements, established in 1930 to serve central banks around the world in their pursuit of monetary and financial stability, appears to be doing the opposite. It has asked central banks to think about “green swan” or “climate black swan” events triggering the next financial crisis. Repeated often enough, that prophesy could dent markets and eventually become self-fulfilling, inflicting incalculable economic pain on working families. Such a crisis would also stymie the ability of nations to pay for action to reduce emissions and to mitigate the effects of climate change.
In the same vein, economic confidence is not helped by oft-repeated claims that the labour market is in the doldrums. To the contrary, as Adam Creighton reports on Friday, the economy generated almost 30,000 new jobs in December. Almost all were part-time and under-employment remains a problem. But the improvement reduced the jobless rate to 5.1 per cent. Jobs growth finished 2019 at 2.1 per cent, more than double the OECD average, Josh Frydenberg noted. The nation has a long way to go to lift productivity. But the figures suggest economic policy is on the right track. Productivity will be the key to lifting wages growth in 2020. But even on last year’s trend, when wages growth slipped slightly to 2.2 per cent over the year to September, it exceeded the CPI, which rose by 1.7 per cent. Households, in the main, are starting the new decade with surging levels of prosperity due to rebounding property prices and a bullish sharemarket. Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows household net worth, on a per capita basis, jumped over the three months to September by $10,699, or 2.6 per cent, to a record $428,574, the fastest growth since 2016.Donald Trump, while prone to his own brand of erratic Twitter hyperbole, did well in Davos because he stuck to facts, mainly the reversal of the economic stagnation that affected the middle class and blue-collar workers in the US for decades. The President’s focus on bread-and-butter issues engaged audiences around the world far more than the vague nouns — inclusion, resilience and sustainability — favoured by many of the forum’s elite attendees. On Wednesday, one of our online readers, Jason, summed up many people’s views when he posted that readers want to hear more about people “who do useful work and less from celebrity activists who demand others do useful work’’.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Jobs reward for growth post-Covid	The Australian	Demand, confidence and investment are key to rebuilding
As the growth of Victoria’s COVID-19 caseload slows down, gradually and painfully, it is encouraging to see business leaders, among others, developing constructive proposals for rebuilding our ravaged economy through reform. Come next year, when government borrowings, support measures and stimulus, of necessity, will need to be wound back, growth strategies will be the lifeblood of recovery. Writing on Monday, Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott points out an inconvenient truth. For the first time since the 1970s, more funds are being invested offshore than overseas investors are pumping into Australia. For an economy in which successive waves of foreign investors have been crucial to economic development and unlocking resources, this is alarming. As Mr Scott, who is chairman of the Business Council of Australia’s tax and federation working group, says, Australia’s uncompetitive corporate tax system is a significant part of the problem.
Josh Frydenberg is correct when he says the Morrison government has moved to drive lower taxes and investment and improve conditions to create jobs. The government has increased the instant asset write-off threshold from $30,000 to $150,000. For businesses with turnovers of less than $500m it has introduced an accelerated 50 per cent depreciation investment boost. Tax cuts for 3.5 million small and family businesses with turnovers under $50m have been legislated and by 2021-22 such firms will be paying tax at the rate of 25 per cent rather than 30 per cent. The past two budgets have also legislated income tax cuts of more than $300bn.
That said, as The Australian has pointed out consistently, the refusal of the Senate two years ago to back a tax cut for larger businesses was a setback for the nation, leaving large companies at a disadvantage in attracting international investment. Our 30 per cent tax rate for large corporations is higher than that of most comparable economies. It exceeds the OECD average of 23 per cent and even the Latin American average.
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox, writing in Monday’s business pages, urges the government to bring forward the tax cuts that have already been legislated. That would make sense in the current environment and the government appears open to the idea. Headway should be made in the October budget.
Mr Willox was candid about the impact of Victoria’s stage-four lockdown, which had driven the national economy “even further backwards”. Melbourne, he says, feels like its heart and soul has been ripped out and is “a shell of its former self’’, a “confused, quiet and fearful place, stripped of activity, community and enterprise’’. With weeks more lockdown ahead, there is “no clear or articulated exit strategy’’. Further afield, prolonged border closures meant more disruption and less opportunity for doing business around the nation.
Amid such a predicament, federal and state measures to boost demand, confidence and investment are key. The long road back to recovery will need adroit policy and planning, on the part of both the private sector and government. As Mr Willox says, Australia is not going to tax or regulate ourselves towards a return to prosperity. In addition to tax reform, sensible improvements to workplace relations, skills and training, red tape reduction and energy policy will be crucial to the jobs of the future. Assessments by Mr Scott and Mr Willox coincide with Master Builders Australia, the nation’s peak building lobby group, forecasting a 27 per cent drop in residential building activity and the largest dive in commercial building activity since 1976. As well as focusing attention on economic strategies, the concerns of business are a clarion call to governments to get their strategies to contain and manage COVID-19 right in the absence of a vaccine. Australia cannot afford another Ruby Princess or hotel quarantine debacle. As Mr Willox says: “There simply cannot be another lockdown without creating a total economic catastrophe.’’	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Putting Humpty together again	The Australian	Demand, confidence and investment will be key post-Covid

Comrade Dan follows Silk Road	The Australian	Dependency on China is high-risk for nations and our states The juxtaposition of two exclusives on Thursday’s front page was telling. In the first story, Damon Johnston and Rachel Baxendale revealed Victoria is locked in final-stage negotiations with Beijing over an investment road map, as part of the communist regime’s pushy Belt and Road Initiative. In the second, below a picture of Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews at Tiananmen Square, Greg Sheridan reported on a new study showing Australia was more dependent on China across strategic sectors of the economy than any other Five Eyes nation. There is a danger in embracing the dragon, for sure, but equally in decoupling from the dance. As we recalibrate our relationship with the rising economic and military giant, we need to keep our eyes open, uphold our values, pursue the national interest and show a united front — as we have, until recently, in our pandemic response.
China has many faces, as changeable as a weathercock. Lately, we’ve felt its scorn and seen a glint of its charm. Punishing our barley and beef producers because of Canberra’s push for an international inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 was brutal and calculated. In a twist, China is making it easier for Australian iron ore to enter its ports — naturally, given its dependence on our rocks because of problems with supplies from Brazil. Intemperate verbiage from Beijing’s sock-puppet news outlet and mouthy envoys is losing its oomph. At times, however, it’s like being in an abusive relationship. National leaders have wisely kept calm and emphasised mutual interests, while some state politicians have played to the cheap seats at the visitors’ end.
Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas has gone out on a limb. Amid trade and pandemic inquiry tensions, Mr Pallas savaged the Morrison government for “vilification” of China. He described the government’s stand as “dangerous, damaging and probably irresponsible”, and laid direct blame on Canberra for the 80 per cent tariff on barley farmers. At best this is wrong, but in the context of the broader issues it is foolhardy. The Andrews government has simply lost the plot, mesmerised by the rhetorical extravagance of Belt and Road marketing. Article 1 of the framework agreement signed last October states Victoria and China must: “Adhere to the principle of mutual consultation, joint efforts and shared benefits. Bearing the Silk Road spirit of peace, co-operation, openness, inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit.” President Xi Jinping serenaded federal parliament in 2014 with that tune.
Victoria, the only state to ink a deal of this kind with China, should adhere to the advice from national security agencies. Don’t do it. While Labor’s unsure deputy leader, Richard Marles, pussyfooted around the issue, more sensible opposition heads saw the agreement as “bad policy and bad optics”. Poor countries are now finding Beijing’s debt-trap diplomacy has bite. Given Victoria has an AAA credit rating and money is preposterously cheap, the state should finance any big, feasible infrastructure projects on its own. If he needs a partner, Mr Andrews should call Scott Morrison or tap into industry super funds. The murkiness of the deal, due to be signed by the middle of this year, is also disturbing. Pulling down shutters on public information is from the Chinese Communist Party’s school of disclosure. Open up, Victoria. The pandemic has awakened Australians to our trade over-reliance on China. One-third of our exports go there, equivalent to sales in our next five markets. Disruption to supply chains has harmed manufacturing. A new report by London think tank The Henry Jackson Society found Australia is dependent on China across 595 categories of strategically important goods, especially in hi-tech areas, such as the internet of things, big data and biotechnology. This compares with the US at 414 and Britain at 229. The study calls on Five Eyes countries to conduct stocktakes of exposure to China in raw materials, components and complex supply chains, and for strategies to deal with it. As we argued on Thursday, the retreat from globalisation presents opportunities. But we should reject protectionism. Fortifying our industrial base by orthodox policy reform, as suggested by two former top Canberra mandarins, will encourage investment, productivity and growth that are not tied to the daily temperature in China.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Kicking its house into touch	The Australian	Devoted rugby fans, and those who love the big games, miss the excitement of our World Cup victories in 1991 and 1999 and the painful thrill of the 2003 Sydney final when Jonny Wilkinson snatched glory for England with a drop goal in the final seconds. We want those exciting days back, which is why after some lean and controversial years, the code needs its house in order. The first challenge for its new chairman, likely to be businessman Hamish McLennan, is to put Rugby Australia’s financial house in order. That is vital as it faces more than $20m in liabilities, with no new broadcast deal in place.
After being leaked a hefty swath of rugby’s financial records, chief sports writer Jessica Halloran poses a couple of key questions on Monday: “How can RA spend $333,000 a day in 2019 and have nothing to show for it?’’ and “Why does the game have no assets to speak of following years of massive broadcast revenue?’’ While all that was happening, the Wallabies slipped to No 7 in the world and crowds and TV viewers went away, despite millions of dollars being poured into marketing, high performance and teams. Former CEO Raelene Castle increased the size of the media department by 33 per cent.Halloran’s report helps solve a mystery hidden for too long from clubs, state organisations, players and fans. That is, the state of the code’s finances. The costly Israel Folau fiasco did not help. But nor does it explain why RA has spent $500m over the past four years. None of this is anything to do with COVID-19, although the pandemic will make the going harder for all codes this season. An audit, and putting the finances to rights, will be important building blocks if the code is to survive and rebuild. As it must.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Belt and Road brings China to PNG and our doorstep	The Australian	Diplomats must work to keep neighbourly relations on track An offer by a Chinese government-backed company to build a $US30bn ($39.3bn) city in one of the most impoverished areas of Papua New Guinea appears to be a classic case of debt-trap diplomacy. But however absurd and unlikely the proposition might be, the planned location for the metropolis, only kilometres from Australian territory, means it must be taken seriously. News of the city plan follows the signing in December of a memorandum of understanding between Chinese interests, PNG Fisheries Minister Lino Tom and Western Province Governor Toboi Awi Yoto to build a “comprehensive multifunctional fishery industrial park” on Daru Island. The city plan, which was put to PNG’s national government in writing in April last year, would expand the project to cover an area of 100sq km.
Western Province is PNG’s most impoverished province and the closest to Australia. Daru is located about 200km from the Australian mainland but within kilometres of the islands of the Torres Strait. China’s city plan includes a major seaport, an industrial area and a free-trade zone. An offer has been made by Hong Kong-registered WYW Holdings to build and operate the city and transfer it to PNG after an unspecified period. The company has a track record for major projects, having worked on Myanmar’s New Yangon City.
WYW says the PNG project is contingent on an agreed sovereign guarantee based on a long-term build-operate-transfer contract. China’s financial and diplomatic outreach across the Pacific has been a growing source of concern for Australia as trade tensions between China and the US and Australia have deteriorated. Expansion of China’s Belt and Road Initiative and worsening relations with the West have coincided with a more assertive international stance being taken by the Chinese Communist Party under President Xi Jinping and his wolf-warrior diplomats. China’s unrelenting drive to gain strategic advantage in the region is on display in the way it is brazenly showing support for Myanmar’s generals in the face of the international condemnation that has followed this week’s coup.
The fallout from the announcement of the Daru fishing agreement is an indicator of what difficulties the latest city proposal may bring for Australia. The Daru fishing proposal offered by Fujian Zhonghong Fishery Limited may never eventuate but it has the blessing of China’s Ministry of Commerce and the support of Beijing’s powerful ambassador in Port Moresby, Xue Bing. China is well aware of the diplomatic discomfort its activities in PNG and around the Pacific are causing Australia. Under the headline “Bonanza at Sea Awaits Island Nation”, China Daily said signing the MoU between PNG and a Chinese fishing company had attracted criticism in Australia about regional security risks and depletion of fishery resources but that critics ignored the economic benefits the project would bring to PNG, including jobs for local people.
China’s generosity, on paper, is exposing simmering resentments about Australia’s inability to deliver greater prosperity to the region. In recent interviews Mr Yoto has criticised Australia’s reaction to the fisheries proposal and its failure to make a counter offer to the Chinese plan. He was not satisfied, he said, with Australia’s intention for his people to remain in poverty. Mr Yoto told the ABC it was good for him to explore what China was offering and he accused Australia of working behind his back to deter foreign investment. Despite promises from China, Australia remains the biggest provider of aid to the region, including a $20m grant for an emergency tuberculosis program in Daru. Australia is PNG’s largest trading and commercial partner, with the latest figures from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade showing bilateral trade worth $6.7bn in 2018 and direct investment of $17bn (2018) in resources, light manufacturing, infrastructure and service delivery. Australia has work to do to keep its standing as PNG’s principal ally in the face of lucrative offers of assistance from China. The government must resist, at all costs, becoming involved in a bidding war with China for the attention of PNG that might enrich members of the political class but have no lasting impact on the ground. At the same time, we must step up our diplomatic efforts and continue to play a constructive role in improving the health and economy of our neighbour. It is openly acknowledged in Port Moresby that China has a history of talking big but delivering small. Australia, by contrast, can be relied on to do what it says it will. Australia has a long-term strategic interest in what happens in PNG and must keep the diplomatic relationship on track.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
UQ emulates China on dissent	The Australian	Disciplining a student protester insults academic tradition
Nine months ago, University of Queensland chancellor and former top diplomat Peter Varghese called on the Morrison government to work with universities to draw “red lines” around areas of research which should not be shared with Chinese counterparts. Besotted as they are with China, UQ chiefs should draw a red line through their repressive behaviour towards 20-year-old philosophy student Drew Pavlou. He has had 11 alleg­ations of misconduct levelled at him following protests and social media posts about UQ’s academic ties with China and his criticism of the Chinese Communist Party’s record on human rights. Mr Pavlou, an elected students’ representative on the university senate, faces a disciplinary hearing on May 20 and potential expulsion from the institution. A petition against his possible expulsion has drawn 25,000 signatures.
The institution’s overreaction, set out in a 186-page document sent to Mr Pavlou, begs three questions. First, what happened to the great academic traditions of intellectual freedom and free speech? Second, when was protest (for a worthy cause, democracy) not part of campus life? Third, why is the university devoting so much time and energy to silencing an undergraduate?
Last July, Mr Pavlou organised an on-campus protest in support of Hong Kong’s independence movement. As we reported at the time, hundreds of students were gathered in the university’s Great Court to express their solidarity with Hong Kong when pro-Chinese students gatecrashed the demonstration. Punches were thrown between the two groups in what became a four-hour standoff. At the protest, the pro-Hong Kong students also highlighted UQ’s links to the Chinese government, through its Confucius Institute. The pro-China students’ banners at the demonstration proclaimed “China’s Hong Kong”, and they chanted “China is great”. Police were called to disband the groups.
Mr Pavlou is awaiting UQ’s decision on whether he will be allowed legal representation at his hearing. As Michael McKenna reported on Wednesday, Brisbane barrister and prominent free speech defender Anthony Morris QC has offered to represen­t Mr Pavlou pro bono. In 2016, Mr Morris successfully represented two of the Queensland University of Technology students who were embroiled in the now-infamous 18C case. Jackson Powell and Calum Thwaites were sued for a breach of the ­Racial Discrimination Act by Cindy Prior, an indigenous administrative officer at QUT. Mr Morris acted free of charge for the students because of his belief in free speech and his insistence that section 18C, which makes it unlawful to “offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate” another person or group because of their race, colour or ethnic origin, “has no place in a liberal democracy”. The lawsuit brought by Ms Prior against the students failed.Writing in The Australian this week, Charles Sturt University public ethics professor and China expert Clive Hamilton said the UQ hierarchy appeared to be trying to intimidate Mr Pavlou into silence. The English-language mouthpiece of the CCP, The Global Times, predictably, wrote recently that UQ students favoured the “expelling or punishing’’ of “an anti-China rioter’’ who had “allegedly disrupted campus order and incited racism’’. However beholden to China the UQ hierarchy may be, copying its treatment of those whose views it opposes defies academic tradition. It needs to draw a few red lines.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
This must be the recession that changes us for good	The Australian	Dismal economic report card reveals there’s worse to come Recession? Australia, you’re standing in it. Josh Frydenberg decided not to wait until September for the next national accounts, and official confirmation of a second quarter of negative growth in gross domestic product, before calling it. The last treasurer to utter the R word, and mean it, was Paul Keating in 1990. No point in looking forlornly in the rearview mirror to the March quarter, when the Black Summer bushfires, natural disasters and first stage of shutdown shaved 0.3 per cent off GDP. Travel bans, social distancing and venue closures took a toll, as well as the first drop in consumer spending since the global financial crisis. But there’s much worse to come, possibly a 10 per cent contraction in output this quarter, before a recovery later in the year.
The Treasurer maintains $259bn, or 13.3 per cent of GDP, in federal aid will support workers, households and businesses. That includes the $70bn JobKeeper subsidy, a doubling of the unemployment benefit, loan relief, free childcare and industry assistance. Only 100 days ago, Treasury had expected a 20 per cent slump in June-quarter GDP. “This was the economists’ version of Armageddon,” he said. There’s more stimulus to come, including a package to help the construction sector, but the official family of Treasury and Reserve Bank advisers are now more hopeful of a stronger revival. There are still areas of devastation, particularly in tourism, education services and construction, which was weak before the pandemic.
The building industry is a vital generator of activity, a vast, energetic ecosystem of multiple contractors, “subbies” and tradies, chomping on bulk materials and churning money through car dealerships, hardware stores and lunch spots. It makes sense to give the sector a dose of sugar on this multiplier effect alone. But it must not become a high-cost grift, like Labor’s home-insulation debacle and school halls extravaganza. Value for taxpayers must be paramount. What point can there be in subsidising granite bench tops and frameless shower screens for people who have the money or desire to capitalise their homes? Far better to add to the housing stock in areas of need, perhaps reducing entry costs for first-home buyers or essential workers. The wrong stimulus would merely bid up the price of existing property, inflate the cost of labour and materials, and make some projects unviable.
Canberra needs to tread carefully. Every dollar of assistance is borrowed, each spending decision involves an opportunity cost. The lobbyists are out in numbers, rubbing their hands — and not only because it’s winter. The Morrison government was right to rebuff pleas for a bailout of the ailing Virgin Australia; a deal would have set a terrible precedent. Besides, the carrier’s shareholders are not short of cash. The crisis is asking companies difficult questions. There’s an imperative to review operations, restructure, and go for growth in a post-crisis marketplace. Asking for a handout should be a last resort, not first port of call because the political class is such an easy touch. Assistance — whether for the arts or strategic manufacturing — must not become permanent struts. The aim is to ease a crisis, not induce dependence.
The Treasurer has pushed back an economic statement from this month to next, after a thorough review of the labour market and income support. The $60bn “surprise” in JobKeeper’s cost is a burden and opportunity. There are calls to extend it to those excluded. There will also be pressure for a more generous “normal” when JobSeeker snaps back in September. The government must not lose sight of the sound principles behind temporary and targeted assistance as the economy bounces back, nor of mutual obligation or adequacy, the cornerstones of the social safety net. We will still have high unemployment, due to cyclical and structural factors. That’s why making it easier for companies to employ people has to guide decisions of the working groups on industrial relations that have just started. Bargaining is hobbled by the “better off overall” test. Awards are overly complex, and there are too many. Parliament needs to change the definition of “casual” worker after the recent Federal Court shock decision. The new workplace compact, if one emerges at all, will be stress-tested by financial officials to make sure changes promote flexibility, productivity and job creation. But businesses will have to do the heavy lifting in recovery, so it’s vital that federal and state governments ease the burdens of regulation and taxation on them. Canberra’s heavy fiscal footprint during an emergency must not become the norm. It’s true our success in flattening the curve of new COVID-19 infections means social restrictions will be lifted sooner than originally thought, notwithstanding the tedious caution of some premiers. As well, we are likely to suffer less economic damage than some of our rich-country peers. Yet the national accounts also tell us that we were, at best, sub-par before the pandemic; we had become lazy and reform-shy. The nation’s dismal economic report card — must be more dynamic, work safer and smarter, use better tools, innovate, hire more people — should be a spur to ditch the bad old ways. This must be the crisis that changes Australia for good.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Basin’s murky trade in water	The Australian	Dismantling the market would squander substantial benefits Water is scarce in a country prone to droughts, which are likely to become more frequent. Scott Morrison has said building drought “resilience”, which replaced the goal of drought “proofing”, requires comprehensive understanding and integrated management of our soil, vegetation and water resources. One of the tools in managing this precious water is a trading system. Water’s most valuable use — say for grains, nuts, vegetables, viticulture or meat — often changes as commodity prices change. So trading in water markets, the theory goes, helps irrigators access water where it is wanted most, to be put to its most productive use. As the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission sees it, water trade allows us to produce more of the things people value the most, which raises the wealth and welfare of the community.
But the $1.5bn water market in the Murray-Darling Basin has failed to deliver on its promise. As we reported last year, water was being hoarded, prices in some areas jumped fivefold and growers were put in a perilous position while speculators made a motza. Last September the Morrison government called in the competition watchdog to investigate and take action on any improper trading of water. The government earlier had asked the ACCC to provide policy advice to improve the water market in the basin, where 90 per cent of trading occurs. In an interim report released on Thursday, the ACCC found the rules are deficient; enforcement of them is inconsistent and limited; and the overall governance of the basin’s water trade is troubled.
The ACCC waded into the basin’s murky world of oversight and found it to be inconsistent, fragmented and complex. There are few rules to prevent market manipulation, conflicts of interest abound and water brokers have no specific industry regulation. A single regulator, akin to one operating in financial services, makes sense. The ACCC also found information crucial to the business decision-making of irrigators and traders, such as allocation policies and river operations policy, is not always well communicated or easy for users to access. Sophisticated traders can easily exploit market flaws. Yet simple identifiers, such as an ABN, would improve market transparency in trades. As well, the ACCC said the rules that managed the trade and delivery of water might not always reflect the physical realities of the river system, particularly in the southern basin.
In some areas there is too much regulation and in others not enough. When water is scarce or demand is rising, the problems make a bad situation worse. So more of the same won’t work. But dismantling the entire system, returning to the era when water was tied to land, as some still advocate, is not the way forward. The ACCC points out trading can deliver big benefits to irrigators: extra income, more production, new business models and freeing up capital to invest on the farm. Ditching trading would hurt the economy and significantly diminish the value of water entitlements, which make up a substantial proportion of farmers’ assets. One estimate values tradeable water rights at $22.7bn. In a nutshell, the water market has outgrown its governing framework and there is a lack of trust. “We need to rethink how these water markets are governed,” ACCC deputy chairman Mick Keogh said, adding “decisive and comprehensive” reform was needed. The pay-off for small and large water users, the community and the economy could be substantial. In 2017, the Productivity Commission found water trading had made the irrigation sector “more prosperous and resilient”. Using water optimally also would provide a much-needed confidence boost to the ailing agricultural sector. The National Farmers Federation has a goal of lifting the value of production to $100bn by 2030. But to achieve that, farmers will need to be more innovative, alive to consumer choices and able to attract investment and workers. Governments need to make tough policy choices to protect the integrity of water allocation, especially in the basin, where one-third of our food is produced. The ACCC’s final report to the federal government, due in November, has the potential to set a course for open, fair and efficient water trading in the basin. But it will require co-operation among basin partners to get the architecture right.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Andrews intensifies border chaos	The Australian	Disproportionate restrictions are hampering recovery in tourism
Being spoiled with beautiful beaches within easy driving of most cities and towns, too few of us, when holidaying in Australia, venture far afield. Today’s three-page Life & Times Feature, “Wish We Were Here’’, could change all that. With COVID-19 making overseas travel impossible, the spread covers some of the extraordinary experiences this country has to offer. There is heli-camping in comfort in the Flinders Ranges, “on a dramatic rocky ridge, fire blazing, wood stacked, Clare Valley wine chilled. The view is astonishing … after dark, stars dance like fireflies, the full moon is so near it appears to balance on a rock just over our left shoulder’’. Another option is Kittawa Lodge on King Island in Bass Strait, “opened in late 2019, blending off-grid luxury and wild environment’’ where “sunset gathers itself into a fiery oil painting” and wallabies bounce around outside. Or, for a different perspective on our largest city, the Shangri-La offers a luxurious staycation, with soaring glass windows giving “the illusion of floating above Sydney Harbour’’. Rottnest Island, 24km across the Indian Ocean from Perth, is car-free with “perfect beaches, rocky coves and lobster-riddled waters’’. Holidaying in Australia is also an opportunity to discover Arnhem Land, a region gently opening up — a Top End wilderness teeming with 60,000 years of continuous living culture.
Holidays such as these would be great escapes, especially after the annus horribilis that was 2020. Tourism is also vital for the economy as it recovers. But senseless, frequently changing border closures by some state leaders, red tape, long queues at checkpoints, anxiety about being stranded interstate and unable to get home for work and school, and the prospect of expensive quarantining in hotels have made domestic travel too daunting for many.
There are few certainties, apart from the likelihood that Premier Mark McGowan’s fortress Western Australia will be a no-go zone. Mr McGowan’s ridiculous scolding of NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Monday for managing the COVID-19 pandemic rather than taking a “crush and kill the virus” approach was out of step with national cabinet’s agreed position. Business leaders rightly slammed Mr McGowan’s criticism as “laughable”. Trying to totally eliminate COVID-19 is impractical for a trading nation. Attempting to do so will only crush and kill investment and job creation.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews added to border confusion on Monday, inflicting his state’s battered citizens and struggling economy with a new “traffic light’’ permit system. It will apply to all Australians entering Victoria, with travellers from different zones to face different testing and quarantine requirements. The system will be like a “permanent Checkpoint Charlie”, as Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said. Mr Andrews had bad news for Victorians anxious to avoid a repeat of the New Year’s Eve border chaos, which left thousands of people distressed and stranded in NSW, saying he would not hesitate to repeat the exercise. The “traffic light’’ system, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said, could leave Victorians retrospectively locked out of their home state if they visited a “green zone” that was reclassified to a “red zone” while they were away.
The extreme approaches of Victoria and WA are out of all proportion with Australia’s COVID-19 caseload. The nation had four new cases of community transmission on Monday, all of them in NSW. Nobody is in intensive care. The maze of confusing, costly, job-destroying over-regulation by some states is now intolerable. National cabinet has failed to avoid the fiasco. The commonwealth lacks the constitutional power to force states to open borders or abandon their ludicrous red tape. But the Morrison government must seek alternative solutions. Australia has done far better through the pandemic than most nations. But some premiers are exacerbating a situation that is already economically and socially fraught. For now, unfortunately, many Australians can only dream of the “healing, almost surrealistic silence’’ of Lord Howe Island’s coast and other such adventures.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Time to step up trade with India	The Australian	Diversifying our export markets must be a priority in the new year In his new role, Trade Minister Dan Tehan is right to prioritise securing an Australia-India free-trade agreement. An agreement, which has been nine years in the making already, is long overdue. And the timing is ideal. In a new report, the Confederation of Indian Industry notes that the potential of the India-Australia economic relationship has not been fully harnessed. The CII has identified a raft of opportunities to boost trade and investment and to collaborate in sectors such as mining, pharmaceuticals, IT, infrastructure, defence, space and tourism.
Two-way trade between India and Australia grew from $13.6bn in 2007 to $30.4bn in 2018. That was overshadowed by trade between Australia and China, which was a record $252bn last year. But with China slamming the door on Australian coal, wine, lobster, beef, barley, wood and now wheat — the latest target in its trade offensive — broadening our export base is key to maintaining prosperity. Developing the trading relationship with India, an important regional ally, will be crucial next year. So will free-trade agreements being negotiated with Britain and the EU.
The CII report is a response to the Australian report, An India Economic Strategy to 2035, completed in 2018 by former Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary Peter Varghese. He noted there was “no market over the next 20 years which offers more growth opportunities” than India. India declined last year to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the 15-nation Asian trading bloc that includes Australia. That decision, the CII notes, necessitates “a strong bilateral partnership … to capture economic opportunities”. It should help that Scott Morrison and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi elevated the bilateral relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership in June. One impediment to freer trade is that while Mr Modi is an economic reformer, he and his Bharatiya Janata Party are tied to the powerful Indian farmers lobby, which is intent on retaining protectionism. Under a policy of self-reliance, India also protects its manufacturers. But as the CII recognises, it is in India’s interests to broaden engagement with Australia to boost its resources ­security and to access better technology, healthcare and agribusiness expertise.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
NSW borrows and builds to generate recovery, jobs	The Australian	Dominic Perrottet has begun important stamp duty reform After the Morrison government’s budget last month, the NSW budget delivered on Tuesday is the most influential economic blueprint in Australia for encouraging post-COVID enterprise and recovery. It will stand the nation in good stead, especially the people and businesses of NSW. At the best of times, payroll tax is a tax on jobs. And in cutting the impost from 5.45 per cent to 4.85 per cent, the lowest in the nation, Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Treasurer Dominic Perrottet will make it more attractive for firms to take on new staff. The measure is timely when unemployment will peak at 7.5 per cent by next month before easing to 5.25 per cent in mid-2024. The reduction will remain in place for two years, giving businesses certainty. To Mr Perrottet’s credit, the budget also leads the way in embarking on a major reform of stamp duty, an onerous state tax that acts as a brake on investment in every jurisdiction of the nation.
In line with the Reserve Bank of Australia’s advice, the Berejiklian government has lifted spending and increased borrowing to boost demand, to save businesses and to encourage hiring. RBA governor Philip Lowe told a House of Representatives committee in August that “by borrowing today to support the economy we are avoiding an even bigger loss of output and jobs that would damage our economy and society for years to come, which would put ongoing strain on the budget”. With interest rates at their lowest level since Federation, the government’s financing costs have never been lower.
While Mr Perrottet acknowledged that public spending was not a permanent solution to economic ills, he has applied the RBA’s advice well. In response to the impact of drought, bushfires and COVID-19, the budget includes a record $107bn in infrastructure spending across four years. Of that, two-thirds will be invested in road, rail and other transport infrastructure with a view to creating 145,000 jobs a year. The projects will double capacity of the Sydney Metro West rail link between the Sydney and Parramatta CBDs, with a travel time of 20 minutes, and provide $9.2bn for the rail link to the new Western Sydney International Airport. From Tweed Heads to Sydney, health infrastructure also will receive a boost. The budget also includes upgrades for schools and the TAFE system. It provides for the extension of 15 hours of free preschool to the end of next year and more than 100 mental health nurses in schools. Intensive tutoring will be funded to assist students affected by the COVID disruptions. Such measures will result in long-term benefits for NSW. By contrast, the $100 worth of vouchers for every adult in NSW for spending at restaurants, cafes, cultural venues and tourist attractions is geared to providing an immediate stimulus. From a fiscally conservative government it’s an extraordinary giveaway at an extraordinary time.
NSW, as Mr Perrottet says, has a long road to travel but is in a better financial position than most nations and states around the world. The state’s ballooning debt, Yoni Bashan reports, will expand to $53bn by June next year before increasing further to $75.4bn and finally topping out at $104bn by 2024.
No start date has been provided, but Mr Perrottet’s move to give home buyers in NSW the choice of whether to pay stamp duty or to opt for a much lower annual property tax could be the start of one of the most significant reforms to state taxes for decades. Replacing stamp duty with a tax based on the value of land has been advocated in every taxation review since the 1970s, Adam Creighton reports. Labor’s Henry review found stamp duty was the most economically damaging of all taxes levied in Australia. NSW Treasury believes the switch would boost growth and make homes cheaper. But property buyers would need to think carefully. “Once a property is subject to the property tax, subsequent owners must pay the property tax,” the budget papers reveal. There is also the possibility that future, big-taxing governments would hike up land tax. As Creighton writes, stamp duty is a volatile source of revenue and discourages owners from buying and selling homes. Taxes on unimproved land values are relatively stable and encourage owners to develop their land. The proposal, like the budget’s spending provisions, will have long-term implications.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Divided America afflicted with grievances and grief	The Australian	Donald Trump must try to heal and keep the dream alive The killing of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis at the hands of police officers is an American tragedy, of a kind that has played out too many times in the life of the great republic. As before, people have taken to the streets in solidarity and sorrow. Many are demanding justice with the resolve Martin Luther King Jr described as a “whirlwind of revolt” in 1963 at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC. But in that “sweltering summer” of “legitimate discontent”, Dr King urged restraint. “We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence,” he said on the steps of the memorial. “Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.” The orator’s dream of racial equality remains elusive, from the streets of the capital to the shore of Santa Monica, while the nation is besieged by pandemic, joblessness and civil unrest.
Like it or not, US President Donald Trump has a moral duty to be a healer, a seeker of common ground in times like these. Even for fine speakers such as Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, this fractious moment of death and disunity would have tested the limits of their empathy and precision. Mr Trump has tried to convey poise and a higher purpose. At the Kennedy Space Centre on Saturday, the President spoke of the “grave tragedy” in Minnesota and the nation’s feelings of “horror, anger, and grief”. “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace,” he said. “And I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred; justice, not chaos are the mission at hand.” These consoling words were lost in the real-time images of conflagrations and warp-speed social media contagions. They were lost, too, because Mr Trump cannot help himself on Twitter, where he is troller-in-chief.
Mr Trump launched attacks over the next few days, with his telltale stream of overkill and invective, mixing reason with rancour, firing up his support base and taking no prisoners among his registered foes, including Democrats, mainstream liberal news outlets and left-wing fringe groups, such as Antifa anarchists. His threats of “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” and deployment of “the most vicious dogs and most ominous weapons” against protesters serve only to raise temperatures. As well, Mr Trump berated the nation’s governors, describing them as “weak” in the face of growing racial unrest. If they didn’t take back the streets and use force to confront protesters, he scolded them, they would look like “a bunch of jerks”. Mr Trump is right to call out thugs and vandals and these state and city leaders, a diverse group, should be his allies in containing the mayhem.
Yet in an election year, few in the political class are dialling down their biases. At a debate in February, one of the Democratic presidential hopefuls cut through the animosity at large in the body politic. Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang said progressives were making a mistake when they acted like Mr Trump was “the cause of all our problems”. The President was “a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years and decades”. Mr Yang was talking of the decline of manufacturing. But the current occupant of the White House, an outlier in the Republican Party, is both a symbol and beneficiary of the capital’s dysfunction, plunge in voter trust and hyper-partisanship. Congressional Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are fanning the flames of division at every juncture — from the various medical and fiscal responses to the pandemic, to the rolling turmoil in cities.
Again, Democrats see electoral advantage in November by fomenting disorder, entrenching a view Mr Trump has lost the plot and ceded control. Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been low-key, seemingly absolved from the national interest challenge of easing tensions. As Washington correspondent Cameron Stewart points out, the vast majority of protesters taking to the streets during the day are not “far left”. They are African-Americans, whites and mums and dads angered by racial inequality, injustice and the handling of the pandemic, in which African-Americans have died at three times the rate of white Americans. But many in the media are misrepresenting the violence and swirl of issues, laying blame directly at the door of Mr Trump while downplaying the role of extremists, opportunists and criminals running wild during curfews, looting and razing buildings.
The US is in treacherous territory. But this is a nation that has seen turmoil on its streets before. Yes it is home to the highest number of COVID-19 deaths and 40 million have lost jobs. American prestige has been dented, its leadership in abeyance in global affairs, as focus turns inward — not just because of the poll in five months. Some will try to spin a narrative of inevitable US decline and the triumphant rise of inferior systems. America’s elites must realise short-run politicking may inflict lasting damage to its institutions. Mr Trump will rightly focus now on law and order to preserve lives, property and the social fabric. But to stop the bleeding and the burning, to heal the grief and grievances, he’ll have to be better than his opponents. It’s a daunting assignment, one he is not suited to by temperament or record to date. But Mr Trump occupies the world’s most powerful office and if he can’t reach the civil rights preacher’s “majestic heights” he must do whatever he can to keep America’s dream alive.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Maintaining the rage to no avail	The Australian	Donald Trump’s antics are putting his considerable legacy at risk The decisive repudiation by all nine justices of the US Supreme Court — including the three he appointed — of Donald Trump’s latest attempt to overturn the presidential election result leaves him with no option but to accept reality. It will not be easy for him to concede that he has been beaten by Joe Biden. But the Supreme Court’s decision is the latest and most important of more than 50 court actions since the November 3 election that have gone against Mr Trump. It is time for him to focus on preserving his legacy rather than diminishing it by continuing to allege fraud he cannot prove.
Late on Monday Australian time, the 538 members of the US Electoral College will cast their ballots in accordance with the certified results of their states, as they are constitutionally required to do. Those give Joe Biden 306 votes and Mr Trump 232. Yet even now, Mr Trump is refusing to do what previous White House incumbents have done to maintain respect for the US’s democratic institutions and ensure a smooth and dignified transition to a successor who, in Mr Biden’s case, got 7 million more popular votes.
Even after the Supreme Court decision, in which his hand-picked justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Bennett concurred, Mr Trump continued to furiously denounce “fraud” and claim he had been robbed. “I WON THE ELECTION IN A LANDSLIDE,” he proclaimed. “But remember, I only think in terms of legal votes, not all of the fake voters and fraud that miraculously floated in from everywhere! What a disgrace!” The aftermath of the election has raised legitimate questions about the US electoral system. But the reality Mr Trump must face is that judge after judge since November 3, including many of the 230 “conservatives” he has boasted of appointing to federal courts, have refused to lend credence to his claims of fraud. One of 53 judges he appointed to the US Court of Appeal, Stephanos Bibas, in tossing out a Trump challenge, concluded: “Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.” The US Supreme Court, in a case brought by Texas and supported by 18 other pro-Trump states as well as 126 US congress members and Mr Trump himself, would not recognise Texas had any legitimacy in the matter before peremptorily tossing it out.
Yet Mr Trump has remained obdurate. He has failed to heed the advice of embarrassed, high-ranking Republicans such as Senator Ben Sasse, who have declared the race over. “Since election night, a lot of people have been confusing voters by spinning Kenyan Birther-type, ‘Chavez rigged the election from the grave’ conspiracy theories,” said Senator Sasse. “But every American who cares about the rule of law should take comfort that the Supreme Court — including all three of President Trump’s picks — closed the book on the nonsense.” Not so Mr Trump: he has turned his enraged sights on one of his loyalists, Attorney-General Bill Barr, denouncing him not just for concluding there was no evidence of fraud but also for failing, before the election, to disclose the existence of a tax evasion investigation into Mr Biden’s son Hunter. He has also lashed out at once-supportive Republican governors of swing states won by Mr Biden, denouncing them as “Rinos” (Republicans in name only) and demanding voters “vote them out of office”. With little more than a month before Mr Biden is sworn in, he is demanding Mr Barr appoint a special counsel to probe the election and Hunter Biden.
Given his ego, Mr Trump’s rage may be unsurprising. He was never going to be a good loser in the style of George HW Bush and Jimmy Carter. Three days after his 2016 victory Mr Trump and wife Melania were welcomed to the White House by Barack and Michelle Obama. In proclaiming his phantom “victory”, Mr Trump has sought to block Mr Biden at every turn. There are reports he will not attend Mr Biden’s inauguration and instead hold a rally of embittered supporters to coincide with it. Mr Trump has been a controversial president. But many of his achievements have been of far-reaching significance. He is imperilling his legacy by being a poor loser. The US and the world would be best served by a smooth, dignified transition of power.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
US democracy is being tested	The Australian	Donald Trump’s bitter endgame offers an unedifying spectacle
The bedrock of American democracy, and why it has worked so well for so long, is a willingness to accept defeat in elections and ensure a smooth transfer of power to the winner. Sadly, with only 15 days to go before his term ends, Donald Trump is showing scant regard for that hallowed founding precept of the great republic that is the leader of the free world. His more than hour-long, blustering rant on Sunday directed at top state government election officials — all Republicans — in Georgia, during which he demanded they “find (me) 11,780 votes” so he, not Joe Biden, could be declared winner of the state at the November 3 presidential election, showed that. It revealed egregious tactics in his desperate bid to reverse his defeat that no American should view with anything but deep despair. “I just want to find 11,780 votes (Mr Biden won the state by 11,779 votes), which is just one more than we have,” he wheedled. “Because we won the state.” He did not win the state; Georgia, with 16 electoral college votes, was won by Mr Biden. Following recount after recount the state legislature endorsed his victory. That was duly accepted by the electoral college when it met on December 14 and formally declared Mr Biden won the presidency by 306 votes to Mr Trump’s 232.
The more than 60 courts actions claiming electoral fraud brought by Mr Trump since November 3 have not changed that emphatic result. Not one of the court actions has gone Mr Trump’s way, even when the judges involved included those in the US Supreme Court and federal courts appointed by him. All have gone against Mr Trump’s insistence he was robbed of victory, some voicing contempt for his unsubstantiated, frequently outlandish claims. Yet in his intimidating weekend call to Georgia officials, the US President, speaking from the Oval Office, demanded they conjure up 11,780 votes. “There’s nothing wrong with saying, you know, that you recalculated,” he said, alternately begging, conniving, pleading, cajoling and even seeming to threaten them.
They rightly declined. It remains to be seen what impact Mr Trump’s extraordinary intervention will have on Wednesday’s (AEDT) crucial Senate run-offs, which will decide who controls the Senate and Mr Biden’s ability to get approval for his legislative program. Many analysts believe that because of Mr Trump’s ill-tempered, “I was robbed” bitterness since November 3 and his unsubstantiated claims of fraud, it is going to be much harder for Republicans to win. Yet he remains unabashed. He has a long history of refusing to accept defeat gracefully. He is now spinning conspiracy theories and election falsehoods on Twitter. The Wall Street Journal has concluded “he doesn’t seem to care what damage he does in promoting the myth of his victory”.
That damage, to the Republican Party and more broadly to American democracy, is spreading. Thursday’s (AEDT) gathering of both houses of congress is supposed to be no more than a perfunctory formality to certify Mr Biden’s victory. But Mr Trump has been tweeting ominous calls for mass street action as the two houses meet. “Big protest in DC. Be there, will be wild,” he has tweeted. “Don’t miss it.” He also has pressured Republican leaders to take up what is seen overwhelmingly as a lost cause. Twelve Republican senators, diehard Trump supporters, have said they will refuse to certify the Biden victory, instead seeking an electoral commission to investigate the fraud claims and report in 10 days. A hundred House Republicans have promised to do the same. Mr Trump’s aim is to force state legislatures to overturn their December 14 electoral college certifications for Mr Biden.
Trump wants to create a constitutional crisis that would see the election result being decided by congress, something he bewilderingly believes could allow him to salvage a second term. This is despite the reality that Democrats control the House of Representatives and senior Republican leaders in the Senate, where the party currently has a 52-48 majority, have made it clear they accept Mr Biden’s victory and will not have a bar of Mr Trump’s bizarre attempts to up-end it. Mr Trump’s tactics are given little chance of succeeding. They are causing deep divisions among Republicans and will make it more difficult to win back the White House in 2024. His embittered actions are showing he cares little about the collateral damage he is causing America’s universally admired democracy and the institutions that underpin its status as the leader of the free world. That is certain to cast a dark shadow over his achievements in the White House.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Pressure is building for reform	The New Zealand Herald	Don’t be surprised if the cost of building supplies becomes the next focus for the Commerce Commission, as pressure builds on the Government to do something about the cost of living.
Having released its final report into fuel prices last year, the competition watchdog is primed for its next market study and odds are shortening that the home-building industry will be the target.
That or the grocery market, another area of angst among consumers amid rising living costs.
Renewed scrutiny of the country’s powerful supermarket duopoly could play well for the Government in election year. However, it is understood Labour has its sights set on building materials — even though the Greens are putting the pressure on food prices. Both industries are long overdue for a crackdown and Labour must back up its previous comments with action.
Back in November 2014, Labour’s then-housing spokesman Phil Twyford (now Transport and Urban Development Minister having lost the housing portfolio) was critical of the National Government for a lack of action on housing costs. “The Government has been talking a good game but has totally failed to tackle the market monopoly,” he said. “The Commerce Commission must investigate the competition problems facing the industry as a whole. It will be the only way to get the Government to act.”
He again called for an inquiry into the price of building materials soon after coming to power in 2017. However, after nearly three years, no action has been taken. Construction costs in the main centres have risen by more than 30 per cent in the past decade, while the price of land has gone up by half during the same period.
New Zealand remains one of the most expensive places in the world to buy building materials, with prices 20-30 per cent higher than Australia, according to some estimates. Though this has much to do with scale and the tyranny of distance, there are only two major manufacturers of building materials, and price competition is limited for some materials.
Twyford has also blamed the high costs on “deals, rebates and incentives for the retailers”. Labour now needs to back this up, especially after its flagship housing policy KiwiBuild has been such a failure.
The building sector contributes more than 6 per cent to GDP, employs more than 250,000 and is the third-biggest industry in our economy by the number of businesses. NZ First and Winston Peters may be pushing for a market study into the banking sector, which, like food, would have wide appeal in an election year. But the banks are already in the firing line, having just endured a capital review and a culture and conduct review.
Housing Minister Megan Woods is understood to have written to Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Kris Faafoi and there is now an informal agreement among Labour that building supplies will be next. Given the initial KiwiBuild promise was a key plank in Labour’s election campaign and 10,000 houses are still contracted to be built, it seems likely.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Fresh game plan to deploy the missing four million	The Australian	Dynamic markets, not protected ones, are the key to growth
Josh Frydenberg shared a snapshot of Australia in grim pandemic shutdown on Tuesday. In essence, four million median-income workers are missing in action, a loss of $4bn a week because of reduced participation, productivity and consumption. The Treasurer told the National Press Club things would get worse before they got better. In the June quarter, gross domestic product will contract by 10 per cent, with our economy $50bn smaller. More than one million jobs have disappeared, wage bills have been slashed, spending on hospitality and recreation have been cut in half. As Mr Frydenberg noted, the jobless rate will climb quickly to 10 per cent or more, using the up escalator; the eventual recovery will be much slower, with unemployment taking the stairs down.
On a positive note, we should cast our gaze to other countries, where the per capita COVID-19 death rate is 100 times greater in Britain, 50 times higher in the US. We’ve flattened the infection curve via travel bans, isolation, social distancing, testing and tracing; it has put the economy in suspended animation, eliciting a “whatever it takes” $214bn response with cash handouts, $1500-a-fortnight wage subsidies, increased welfare payments and free childcare. Liquidity measures worth $105bn are coming from the central bank and Canberra. A budget in balance has been shredded, with a plunge in revenue and a consequent rise in debt and interest costs. The Treasurer said we’d be living within our means for years, with the emergency fiscal measures temporary, targeted and proportionate. He said the debt burden would be reduced by a fast-growing economy, not higher taxes.
The recovery depends on a dynamic business sector. According to Deloitte Access Economics, a $69bn collapse in business investment this year threatens that revival. The Morrison government claims it is sifting through practical solutions, hoping to harvest a fresh growth, jobs and productivity agenda. Mr Frydenberg was recycling last year’s budget speech by emphasising skills, infrastructure, investment tax breaks and flattening the personal income tax scale. We said it then, we’ll say it now: Australia needs a bolder reform game plan, not one-off measures, bracket-creep kickbacks and a 10-year capital works program, as worthy as those measures may be. The Treasurer points out how the crisis has led to new modes at workplaces, reduced red tape and improved intergovernmental co-operation. Will we simply snap back to the old ways, when productivity was on the slide?
A pleasing sign is Mr Frydenberg remains attuned to the core values he trumpeted in his first budget last year, providing philosophical and rhetorical ballast to the revival project. He again accentuated encouraging personal responsibility, maximising personal choice, rewarding effort, risk taking and ensuring a safety net that is based on decency and fairness. While Scott Morrison took a limited number of policies to the people last May, they were grounded in aspiration, thrift, mutual obligation and openness to the world. Bill Shorten offered revolution, redistribution and retribution in the minds of get-ahead Australians. Labor ditched its legacies of removing growth impediments, using market solutions and encouraging aspiration, for class war and niche social engineering. How far forward has it moved under its new leadership? It has regressed into Bambi-eyed Hansonism on foreign workers.
With weaker demand locally and globally, the Treasurer said there would be more competition in the post-virus world for all goods and services. We need workplace reforms and tax policy fit for the challenge. Right now, large employers pay a 30 per cent company tax, the second highest rate among rich countries. Mr Frydenberg maintains unleashing the power of dynamic, innovative and open markets is central to recovery, with the private sector leading job creation, not government. So why are our big companies carrying huge weight on a sodden racetrack? As well, there is far too much complexity and not enough flexibility in industrial relations. Redeploying the missing four million workers will be more difficult because of our antiquated work rules.Like the Treasurer, we see a clear and present danger of protectionist sentiment re-emerging on the other side of the crisis. There is a new push to make manufacturing great again. Why not? It makes sense to boost capacity to produce personal protective equipment here rather than rely on billionaire middlemen to source supplies from China. But factories need to survive on their own wits, not behind a fortress wall. Subsidies suck scarce capital and labour that could be put to better use. By all means we should reduce the impediments to local manufacturing through supply-side reforms, and improve the incentives for product research and development. “While we must always safeguard our national interest, we must also recognise the great benefits that have accrued to Australia as a trading nation,” the Treasurer said. We ship a tremendous amount of ore overseas, produce three times as much food as we can eat and have a unique continent many people would like to visit. Those competitive advantages have made us prosperous. Let’s not squander our future options with a timid or retrograde strategy.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Report confirms suspicions on China’s Covid response	The Australian	Earlier action on the virus could have prevented a global catastrophe A World Health Organisation independent review of China’s early response to the COVID-19 outbreak has reached the same conclusion as US investigators, and has confirmed the suspicions of Australia. This is that Chinese authorities did not respond quickly or forcefully enough when the first cases of the novel coronavirus became apparent. The slow response allowed the virus to spread globally with devastating consequences. With much of the world in the grip of a deadly second wave of the pandemic, it is imperative that a team of investigators now in quarantine in China is allowed to fully investigate how the Wuhan outbreak started and what can be done to stop it happening again.
Australia played a high-profile role in calling for an open investigation into the genesis of COVID-19, and its diplomatic and trade relations with China have suffered as a result. China has accused Australia of doing the bidding of the US at a time when trade between the two countries was in free fall. For most Australians, however, the issue is more clear cut. For any fair-minded person, it is only natural that every effort be made to establish what went wrong and why. From this perspective, comments on Wednesday by Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese critical of Australia’s outspoken demands for an inquiry can be seen both as opportunistic and craven. Mr Albanese says there has been an absence of leadership from the Morrison government on how Australia is working with the WHO and key countries to ensure our resilience to future pandemics. He says Australia has burned capital with a poorly managed call for an inquiry, which was always going to take place. Albanese says the government sought a splashy announcement, when it should have been doing the behind-the-scenes diplomatic work to generate global support for a thorough investigation. On the evidence to date, Mr Albanese’s appraisal lacks credibility.
The World Health Organisation has rightly been criticised for being too close to China and acting too slowly for fear of upsetting the communist regime. Many questions still remain about the future of the WHO’s funding, as well as the organisation’s impartiality and competence.
Criticisms of the body have been confirmed by investigations undertaken by the WHO’s own Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, led by former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. The panel was appointed by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who said he could not imagine “two more strong-minded, independent leaders to help guide us through this critical learning process”.
The panel reported on Monday that China had been too slow to act and was critical of the World Health Organisation for not declaring an international emergency until January 30. It said public health measures could have been applied more forcefully by local and national health authorities in China in January. The report said when evidence emerged of human-to-human transmission in other parts of the world, it was ignored. The panel questioned why the WHO’s Emergency Committee did not meet until the third week of January and did not declare an international emergency until its second meeting at the end of that month. “Though the term pandemic is neither used nor defined in the International Health Regulations (2005), its use does serve to focus attention on the gravity of a health event. It was not until March 11 that WHO used the term,” the report said.
Australia took action to close its international borders before a formal pandemic declaration was made by the WHO, limiting the initial spread of the virus. Dr Yi-Chun Lo, of ­Taiwan’s Centres for Disease Control, has said the pandemic could have been avoided at the beginning if China was transparent about the outbreak and was quick to provide necessary information to the world.
The WHO panel has called for a “global reset” and said that it would make recommendations in a final report to health ministers from the WHO’s 194 member states in May. Ms Sirleaf and Ms Clark noted repeatedly that the WHO’s ability to enforce its advice, or enter countries to investigate the source of disease outbreaks, is severely curtailed. They said the pandemic had shown that the WHO’s member states must act swiftly to reform the agency, boost its funding, and give it powers to enforce international health regulations. Before it gets more powers and funding, however, the WHO must demonstrate that it is up to the task.
A useful measure will be the outcome of a major international effort to establish how the virus started. A team of 13 international scientists working under the auspices of the WHO is currently in quarantine in China preparing to investigate the likely origins of the virus. China has been unco-operative to date and is bristling at calls from the US that the WHO’s expert team of investigators be allowed to interview “care givers, former patients and lab workers” in the central city of Wuhan. The head of the US delegation, Garrett Grigsby, said China should share all scientific studies of animal, human and environmental samples taken from a market in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have emerged in late 2019. Comparing these samples would help tracing efforts to establish the source. The director-general of the health emergency response office of China’s National Health Commission says the studies need co-ordination and co-operation rather than political pressure. But as the death toll continues to mount around the world, and lockdowns cripple major economies, it is China that must be prepared to co-operate. China’s silencing of whistleblower doctors and journalists who have attempted to bring unwelcome facts to light reflects badly on Beijing. However uncomfortable, the truth must be known on the origins of a pandemic that has wreaked havoc but could have been stopped before it took root.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Time to open up for summer	The Australian	Economic activity should be escalated to the next stage US president-elect Joe Biden, for good reason, is looking to Australia for ideas on how to defeat the COVID-19 health and economic crises in the US. Coming into summer, we are in the fortunate position of recording 13 straight days with no new cases in Victoria, our hardest-hit state. As economic recovery gains momentum, the nation’s leaders, especially the premiers who control many of the practical levers, should not waste the opportunities our hard-won success has created.
Consumer confidence is at a seven- year high. Deferred home-loan payments are restarting, a resurgence in the housing market is expected and the Reserve Bank of Australia notes households have built up a $100bn savings barrier during the pandemic.
It’s time to step up to the next level, however, with a well-managed return to workplaces in areas such as Melbourne’s still-deserted CBD. And it almost beggars belief that important state borders remain closed.
Paul Guerra, chief executive of Victoria’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is right when he says the Andrews government needs to urgently develop a plan for workers to return to their offices. This is especially important in Melbourne’s CBD, where small businesses reliant on foot traffic continue to suffer. At this stage, Premier Daniel Andrews’ explanation that it was a “really big challenge” for the government to “get the balance right” on allowing workers to return is not good enough. He has not even provided a date to allow businesses and workers to plan for.
With no community transmissions of the virus Australia-wide for days, tourism industry leaders see no reason not to reopen borders. Every day that state border restrictions remain in place, Gold Coast tourism operators lose another $10m in revenue for reasons they are struggling to understand, as Robyn Ironside and Rachel Baxendale report on Friday.
While the planned NSW reopening to Victoria on November 23 remains 10 days away, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is not scheduled to make an announcement on Queensland’s borders until a week after that. The incomprehensible delay is costing revenue and jobs. Australia may be in the fortunate position of a safe, effective vaccine being in place in time for winter next year. That is no excuse, however, not to open up safely as soon as possible to alleviate economic hardship. Many people are ready to book holidays, and schools are already preparing to break up for the year. The topic should be front and centre at national cabinet. Northern hemisphere nations would love to be facing the same choices.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Hard lessons to learn from Melbourne’s Covid clusters	The Australian	Eliminating the virus is not practical, affordable or realistic In managing the nation’s first significant outbreak of COVID-19 after the initial phase of the disease earlier in the year, governments, health professionals and commentators need to approach the problem with cool heads and warm hearts. While it appeared to many a few weeks ago that Australia had coronavirus beaten, Scott Morrison, the national cabinet and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee warned repeatedly that the recovery process was likely to see spasmodic spikes of the disease. The daily tally of new cases in Victoria — 165 on Thursday, the second-highest after Tuesday’s record of 191 — is disheartening. Painful and costly as the six-week lockdown of metropolitan Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire will be for Victoria and for the nation, there is no suggestion from health authorities that it is unnecessary. From a small base a month ago, the caseload threatened to get out of hand. And this is unlikely to be the last such spike. The situation has highlighted the need to better manage future outbreaks. The errors and systemic shortcomings that have emerged must be remedied.
One of the most important, as Yoni Bashan reports on Friday, is that Victorian health officials did not adhere to national guidelines for COVID-19 contact tracing. These specify close contacts should be followed up daily for flu-like symptoms. The breakdown contributed to the spread of the virus that led to a lockdown of metropolitan Melbourne. Another major problem is a shortage of public health professionals trained to undertake contact tracing in Victoria. The shortage impeded efforts to slow down the accelerating rate of infections. The federal Department of Health is organising an additional 200 public health professionals from other states to help Victoria out. It is a base all jurisdictions need to cover. Queensland has been proactive, giving skilled staff from other areas of the public sector, such as libraries, online training to undertake tracing if the need arises.
If lockdowns are to be avoided in the event of future spikes, such serious errors must be avoided. Tuesday night’s debacle, when 48 passengers from a Jetstar flight from Melbourne left Sydney Airport without being screened and cleared, was another prime example. So was the Andrews government’s irresponsible failure to supervise private security operators overseeing hotel quarantine. The link between Melbourne’s two main clusters — in housing commission flats in the inner northwest and the city’s largest Islamic school — shows more must be done to ensure all cultural groups do their part in preventing virus outbreaks.
But in context, the bigger picture shows there is no need for panic or extreme measures that would prolong the economic fallout from COVID-19 unnecessarily. Protecting the economy, a major determinant of quality of life, and our ability to care for the sick and vulnerable, is vital. The coronavirus is highly contagious, debilitating and dangerous, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions. Of 8845 COVID-19 cases diagnosed so far, the virus has killed 106 Australians. Most of its victims have been aged 70 to 90. In comparison, last year was a bad flu year, with 310,000 confirmed cases and more than 800 deaths in Australia — also predominantly among the elderly. That said, the Swedish system of so-called “herd immunity” that has resulted in 5482 deaths from 73,858 cases — in a country with fewer than half of Australia’s population — is not a viable alternative approach.
Advocates such as the Grattan Institute, calling for the replacement of Australia’s suppression strategy with one of elimination, like New Zealand, would do the nation no favours if their wishes were followed. New Zealand, with five million people in an area a third of the size of NSW, had little choice but to opt for elimination. Its supply of intensive care beds had fallen for 20 years before the pandemic, leaving it behind Australia and other comparable nations.
Australia has done well in equipping our hospitals to cope with an influx of serious COVID-19 cases. Medical experts agree that our fatality rate, one of the lowest in the world, reflects our high testing rates and the fact Australian hospitals have not been overwhelmed. Our CFR rate — the ratio between confirmed deaths and confirmed COVID-19 cases — is 1.19 per cent. Britain’s rate is 15.44 per cent. Italy’s CFR is 15 per cent and the US rate is 4 per cent. The situation in Victoria, regrettably, has necessitated the stop-start-stop pattern of recovery the Prime Minister wanted the economy to avoid. As cases of the virus top 12 million around the world, with 550,000 deaths, lessons learned in Melbourne must be applied as Australians learn to live with the virus, as safely as possible.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Victorians in fight of their lives	The Australian	Elimination of the coronavirus is not a realistic strategy
Scott Morrison is right to insist that the states should continue holding the line on the nation’s aggressive suppression strategy to deal with COVID-19. “You can’t mortgage off your economy for what would prove to be a very illusory goal,” the Prime Minister said on Thursday. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee agrees, also noting that suppression leads to periods of elimination in parts of the country. “True elimination in Australia is unrealistic in the absenc­e of a vaccine,” a Department of Health spokesman said. “It is impossible to completely seal the borders of any country, even an island continent such as Australia, and nor should we try.” Returning travellers, trade vessels and crews would continue arriving. We cannot cut ourselves off from the world entirely. Lockdowns are a last resort — “what you have to do when things get to the point they have in Victoria”, as Mr Morrison says. There, the situation is “beyond what we would have hoped would have occurred”.
Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton has said elimination is “worthy of consideration”. But his main focus must remain the battle to bring the pandemic back under control. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt was not exaggerating when he said Melburnians and other Victorians were in “the great fight of our lives”. Thursday’s news was confronting. New coronavirus cases in the state increased by 317, the highest daily spike since the pandemic started. Of those new cases, 28 have been linked to known outbreaks and 289 remain under investigation. As untraced community transmissions in Victoria approach 1000, virus detectives are trying to contact tens of thousands of COVID-19 patients’ close contacts. Given the importance and labour-intensive nature of testing and swift, accurate tracing, Victoria deserves generous support from the rest of the nation to bolster its efforts. The Morrison government has offered more than 1000 Australian Defence Force personnel to help with tracing.
Of 109 patients with the virus in Victorian hospitals, 29 are in intensive care, including five people in their 40s, six in their 50s and eight in their 60s. Many are on ventilators. The government has done well to ensure the state is well equipped, with 1200 ventilators in hospitals and hundreds more in storage. More than 1000 IV pumps, hundreds of patient monitors and millions of gloves and masks are ready for use. As Melbourne hospitals shift their focus to COVID-19, much of the scheduled elective surgeries and other procedures in public and private hospitals are being postponed.
By locking down at vast cost to their economy and quality of life, Victorians are doing other Australians an important service by containing the virus. Limiting the outbreak as much as possible is critical, not only to protect those most at risk of infection and death but also because new research from Italy into the medium-term effects on sufferers suggests COVID-19 has left patients, including some in their 50s, with anxiety, depression and exhaustion. A concurrent British study shows fit young COVID-19 patients are at risk of lasting lung problems.
Other states must learn from Victoria’s experience, where the main problems arose initially from the mismanagement of quarantine hotels (which will remain essential for months at least) and inadequate tracing. NSW, fortunately, appears to have grasped the lessons. As Mr Morrison says, NSW health officials moved “incredibly quickly” to investigate the cluster at the Crossroads Hotel in southwestern Sydney. The NSW situation remains tense, but the fact new cases were limited to 10 on Thursday was encouraging.
Victoria’s predicament should be a wake-up call to all Australians whose adherence to social distancing, hand washing and recording their names in cafes, pubs and other venues has become slack since the virus abated in other states and territories. Victoria recorded no cases as recently as June 9. The COVID-19 battle is complex and far from over. There is no room for complacency about taking precautions if we want to restore the economy and hasten the return to normal life.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Nation is out of recession but not out of the woods	The Australian	Employment numbers will be the key indicator for economic strength
In more ordinary times, Australia’s speedy bounce back from recession as confirmed in Wednesday’s national accounts would be cause for unbridled celebration. Given the circumstances that forced the managed suppression of economic activity to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, however, and the high level of government support still being used to bring the economy out of coma, some caution is warranted. This is not to downplay the welcome economic news contained in the national accounts, nor positive comments from government, the Reserve Bank and international authorities such as the OECD. But as economics editor Adam Creighton has written, another two quarters of data are needed for the clarity required to set policy in future.
Nonetheless, the latest quarterly figures confirming Australia’s strong performance relative to other developed nations gives cause for optimism. In headline terms, Australia’s economy is bouncing back strongly from recession, posting the fastest growth since the late 1970s on the back of a surge in consumer spending as coronavirus restrictions unwind. The economy grew 3.3 per cent across the three months to the end of September, better than the 2.5 per cent most economists had expected. The rise partly reverses the 7 per cent drop in the second quarter when business restrictions and lockdowns were at their peak.
Household spending, which plunged almost 13 per cent in the second quarter, rose almost 8 per cent in the latest period, driven by spending on hotels, restaurants and cafes, which began to resume more normal trading. Victoria was the only state to record a fall in household spending, of 1.2 per cent, as a result of a second lockdown that began in July. Gross domestic product rose 3.3 per cent in the quarter as COVID-19 restrictions eased across most states and territories. One reality check is that household spending in the September quarter was still 6.8 per cent lower than in the December quarter last year, immediately before the pandemic.
Josh Frydenberg was upbeat about the latest figures, saying the creation of 178,000 new jobs last month signalled an improving employment outlook for the nation. The Treasurer’s optimism was shared by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe, who told a parliamentary committee he expected GDP growth to be “solidly positive” in the September and December quarters. The RBA’s central scenario is now for the economy to grow by 5 per cent next year and a further 4 per cent in 2022. The Commonwealth Bank says it wants to see more data but remains largely positive about the outlook for early next year.
Scott Morrison says the easing of hard borders, restoration of lost jobs and hours, and the graduation of more than two million Australians from JobKeeper payments in October demonstrates “the comeback is on”. But Anthony Albanese used question time on Wednesday to warn the government not to claim a premature economic victory. The Opposition Leader is rightly focused on the fact unemployment remains high and underemployment is an ongoing concern.
In an appearance before parliament on Wednesday, the RBA governor gave an indication of the long road ahead. Dr Lowe’s key message is that the economy has turned the corner and recovery is under way. He says the RBA expects unemployment to peak between 7 per cent and 8 per cent, rather than close to 10 per cent as earlier forecast. The RBA target is to get unemployment back below 5 per cent, something that is expected to take several years to achieve. Dr Lowe says this points to an extended period of record low interest rates, which have already buoyed the housing market.
The immediate outlook for employment is clouded by the impact of the federal government’s JobKeeper scheme, which subsidises employers to keep workers on their books. While the trend is positive in terms of a reduced demand for JobKeeper payments last month, well below government expectations, a true picture on jobs and economic health will not emerge fully until the subsidy measures are removed early next year. There is a suspicion that some businesses and individuals are hanging on until the end of this year in the hope that next year will unfold as if nothing has happened. The wish is that the pandemic is over and we can all move on. This clearly is not the case. There are still restrictions on travel and the capacity at which some companies can operate, particularly in the hospitality sector. Many small businesses that have been hit by lockdowns and border closures have been able to survive only because of intervention by government and special measures such as eased insolvency trading rules and loan repayment deferrals from banks. It is only when these measures are unwound and stock is taken of the higher levels of debt assumed during the crisis that a full picture of the health of the economy will emerge.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Boosting gas supply at fair price	The Australian	Encouraging investment in energy development remains a vital goal Major gas users, the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission have warned for several years that most states, including the manufacturing hubs of NSW and Victoria, could suffer gas shortages on peak demand days in coming years. Against that background, Scott Morrison’s two-year deal with east coast LNG exporters to offer uncontracted gas to Australian companies first is a good move.
The deal, signed in Gladstone on Wednesday by the Prime Minister and three Queensland LNG producers — Santos-led GLNG project, Origin Energy’s APLNG and Shell’s QCLNG — did not include price controls the manufacturers and unions wanted. But such controls would distort the market at a time of booming demand for gas internationally. The exporters, understandably, resisted the pressure for price controls. But their agreement to offer uncontracted gas to the domestic market first, on competitive terms, before it is exported, should put downward pressure on prices by guaranteeing supply for east coast industrial and domestic users.
As Resources Minister Keith Pitt says, it is important to strike a balance between affordable gas for consumers and a price that encourages new gas resource investment and development. To that end, states must speed up approval processes for gas projects. Reliable, affordable gas supply is essential to our post-COVID-19 recovery, especially in manufacturing. The sector employs 850,000 people, and many companies rely on gas to operate. On one hand, the lack of a price mechanism falls short of the $4-$6 a gigajoule called for by former Dow boss ­Andrew Liveris, who advised the ­ National COVID ­Co-ordination Commission on how manufacturing could boost the economy after the pandemic. Mr Liveris on Thursday said “if this is where it stops, I would be extremely disappointed”. In November, major industrial gas users met Mr Pitt and Energy Minister Angus Taylor to call for a price mechanism. On the other hand, gas producers feared that more government intervention would add fresh sovereign risk to the LNG industry, leading to an investment strike. LNG entrepreneurs have invested more than $70bn into building Queensland’s gas export industry. Since the Turnbull government headed off supply shortfalls by introducing the Domestic Gas Security Mechanism in mid-2017, the spot price for gas has dropped from $12.50-$10.50 to $7-$5 a gigajoule. Adequate supply is vital, but skewing the market would be a mistake. Mr Morrison’s deal is a pragmatic compromise, designed to ensure sufficient supplies and encourage investment in gas.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
With right reforms, we’ll have it made in Australia	The Australian	Energy costs, tax and red tape are killing our industrial base The global order is being remade by the coronavirus pandemic, with a retreat from free markets and open trade. State intervention is in vogue, a steady hand on the tiller of a nation’s destiny in a crisis. Scott Morrison, Josh Frydenberg and Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe have conjured $320bn, or 16.4 per cent of national output, in financial support to get companies and workers through the calamity of shutting down commerce and social life to suppress COVID-19. Almost 60 per cent of workers are on state income support. Supply chains are ruined, trade and capital flows disrupted. One coping mechanism for governments and voters has been the idea of sovereignty. In a ravaged world, simplicity, self-sufficiency, security and control are on a unity ticket: Australia first.
Sheltering from the economic storm is understandable, but building a wall against the world is a losing strategy for a nation reliant on foreign capital for its expansion and a liberal trading order to earn its livelihood. Look at the harm China is doing to itself through tariffs and import bans. Wounded by global derision, it is lashing out at Australia. Beijing will realise that in such delicate matters there’s no such thing as a free punch. Because of China’s unreliability, if not caprice, our political and policy class is seeking to build up capacity to produce goods that are strategically vital. In case of medical emergency, it is wise to stockpile ventilators, personal protective equipment, sanitiser and medicine. Do we need to make our own? Only if we can do so at reasonable cost. Factories should be able to switch equipment and labour to meet demand for other items outside of crises.
“Made in Australia” runs deep into our national psyche; it’s there in the reptilian part of the brain, keeping us feeling safe. Populist politicians go there, speaking of Holdens and Dunlop Volleys, evoking a country that “makes things”. Of course, we are a country that makes things, and sells them to the world. Manufacturing is a major employer. In the 12 months to February last year, average employment in the sector was 918,000; only five of 19 industries used more people. One in 10 men work in the sector; only construction employs more males. While that’s a huge fall from the protectionist 1950s, even 80s, manufacturing has critical mass and durability. It is now geared to high-quality products and exports. Last year our manufactured exports were worth $54bn, led by aluminium, copper, pharmaceuticals, medicines, aircraft and parts, and telecom equipment. We are adding value to raw materials.
Manufactured exports grew by 17 per cent last year, no doubt helped by a low dollar. But the post-virus world will bring much weaker demand for traders; competition for all goods and services will be intensified. We need to get our baseline right to thrive in this era by cutting taxes and red tape. Industry and Science Minister Karen Andrews told the National Press Club on Wednesday that a factory can be proposed, approved, built and operational in the US in less time than it takes to jump the very first approval hurdle in Australia. The lesson for our governments from the pandemic was to facilitate, not overregulate. Wisely, Ms Andrews rejected a push to nationalise industries or create government-owned entities, declaring history has proven “the folly of that approach”.
What’s good for manufacturing applies to business generally. Life during shutdown has seen greater co-operation between governments, unions and employers in redesigning work. That flexibility, which enterprise bargaining was meant to encourage, should carry on in recovery. Antiquated rules and flawed agreements add unnecessary costs and discourage hiring. So, too, do payroll taxes. More broadly, an uncompetitive company tax rate hinders investment and expansion. That is a clamp on training skilled workers, especially apprentices, and developing new products. As well, infrastructure provision needs to be priced properly, and procurement should not be tilted to locals, as tempting as that must be on major projects. Australia first, whatever the cost, as Labor and unions would have it, will leave taxpayers last. A robust manufacturing sector needs lower energy costs. Perhaps the biggest national policy fail we’ve had in a generation has been to botch energy policy. We are an energy superpower, with abundant coal, natural gas, uranium and renewables. But we have squandered this competitive advantage in myriad ways, including through political dysfunction. Pragmatic union leaders are calling for the fast-tracking of gas projects to sustain our industrial base. State government bans, rural landholders and urban-based zealots hinder new projects. The Morrison government’s preferred path out of the energy morass and through the climate wars is via the technology investment road map. On Wednesday it issued a discussion paper, seeking to accelerate hi-tech projects to commercial status while supporting a lower-carbon economy. The investment needed depends on getting many other settings right — from tax to red tape, industrial relations to skills — to make our way beyond the virus wreckage.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
EDITORIAL And the crowdfund goes wild	The Northern Advocate	Equity crowdfunding has been a welcome platform for early stage companies to raise capital and is seeing significant interest from investors, both large and small.
But it’s time the financial regulator paid greater scrutiny to what some of the companies are telling investors in their offer documents. This is especially so given some serious questions arising from recent crowdfunding by medicinal cannabis companies.
Furthermore, depending on the outcome of the New Zealand cannabis referendum, with preliminary results due today, there may be fresh interest from recreational cannabis businesses in the crowdfunding sphere. It would be only natural for businesses looking for seed capital to expand cannabis operations to turn to the crowd for funds.
When equity crowdfunding was introduced in 2014, the Government chose to take a light-hand approach to regulation.
Under the current regime the offers can be promoted to the general public under a reduced disclosure regime, compared to normal requirements. This reduces the regulatory cost and burden, thus opening the door to funding from the public for companies which aren’t yet ready to conduct an initial public offering and sharemarket listing.
The regulations allow a company raise up to $2 million from retail investors (and more through wholesale or other eligible investors) in any 12-month period. The platforms themselves have been pushing for the retail cap to be raised to $10m.
While no crowdfunded companies have been revealed as fraudulent, there are lingering concerns that this relatively laissez-faire regulatory approach could result in a “wild west” of substandard platforms. This comes two years after the Financial Markets Authority warned equity crowdfunding platforms and companies offering financial products through them not to put out false or misleading advertising.
The Financial Markets Conduct Act’s fair dealing provisions ban misleading and deceptive conduct, false or misleading representations, unsubstantiated representations, and offers of financial products during unsolicited meetings.
Of course, it’s not just cannabis companies that need to be scrutinised. But the sector is a hotbed with some of the capital raisings filled within a few hours.

And the crowdfund goes wild . .	The New Zealand Herald	Equity crowdfunding has been a welcome platform for early stage companies to raise capital and is seeing significant interest from investors, both large and small.
But it’s time the financial regulator paid greater scrutiny to what some of the companies are telling investors in their offer documents. This is especially so given some serious questions arising from recent crowdfunding by medicinal cannabis companies. (See Business feature on A26).

This is in contrast to some far more prescriptive US and Canadian rules.
While no crowdfunded companies have been revealed as fraudulent, there are lingering concerns that this relatively laissez-faire regulatory approach could result in a “wild west” of substandard platforms. The FMA is now looking into at least two equity crowdfunded companies in terms of their disclosures to investors.

It’s important that early-stage and small companies get this right, especially in the current economic climate.

ADF braces for alarming report	The Australian	Ethics are vital. And Special Forces must focus on core jobs Chief of the Army Lieutenant-General Rick Burr, appropriately, has written to all his troops to prepare them for the imminent release of the Brereton Report into allegations of war crimes by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. It is his duty to remind those under his command of their obligations to the nation, to Anzac forebears and to one another. On Saturday, General Burr told Inquirer he had not yet seen the formal report of retired justice Major-General Paul Brereton. However, the senior leadership of the army had already concluded the culture of our Special Forces had to change. General Burr conceded that he knew enough already to be deeply troubled by the substance of the allegations about killing and mistreatment of non-combatants and prisoners of war. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds has also warned the nation to be prepared for shattering revelations Australians are proud of our men and women in uniform, who respond to challenges few of us can imagine. This century, our wars have been fought exclusively by volunteers. Most have upheld the finest traditions of the Australian Army. Those who have not must be held to account. We support the ADF leadership in restoring ethical standards. Barbarism in the defence of noble values is unacceptable. But it is also essential to maintain perspective. Anyone who has committed crimes must face the full force of the law. But our soldiers must continue to exhibit the “warrior ethos”. We hope General Burr’s missive is not the prelude to another long process of inquiries into “toxic masculinity” and the diversion of forces into compliance with oversight by woke human rights commissioners. Our Special Forces are the point of the national sword. In dangerous times they need to concentrate on their core business, not be crippled by yet more reviews into their culture. As General Burr said: “Most people in Afghanistan did the right thing. Veterans and their families need to know that. Waiting for this report is exacting a very heavy toll.” Release it and let justice take its course. The nation and those whose reputations have faced innuendo for almost five years deserve no less.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Lessons from Covid resurgence	The Australian	Europe and the US are struggling to contain the virus
Australia’s success in suppressing the COVID-19 virus has been underlined by Boris Johnson’s grim announcement that England has been forced into a stringent, second-wave lockdown amid fears surging infection rates could overwhelm medical services by the first week of December. As the northern hemisphere winter sets in, Mr Johnson, who is being criticised for his chaotic, incoherent response to the pandemic, spoke on Saturday of a looming “medical and moral disaster” in which “doctors and nurses would be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would get oxygen and who wouldn’t, who would live and who would die”. The British cabinet was warned daily COVID-19 deaths could soon reach 4000 and “the reasonable worst case scenario of 85,000 deaths by the end of winter (the basis for National Health Service planning) will be breached”.
Imperial College, London, underscored the depth of the crisis with research showing 100,000 people a day across Britain were being infected. On September 1 there were 50 COVID-19 patients on ventilators in England. Last Wednesday there were 788. The UK has so far recorded more than 1 million cases and 46,555 deaths. Under fierce criticism from his own MPs, Mr Johnson expressed regret in reimposing a lockdown that could run until Christmas. But he is not alone in facing a resurgent wave of the virus.
Germany, once regarded as the exemplar in the European response to COVID-19, with its effective test-and-tracing system, has also been forced into a strict second lockdown. So has France, where Emmanuel Macron has barred virtually all activity deemed non-essential. Infection rates and deaths in France are at their highest level since April. On Thursday authorities reported 47,637 cases and 235 new deaths. Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland and the Czech Republic are also facing infection and death rates greater than during the first wave. Sweden, which controversially avoided lockdowns during the first wave, is also facing a resurgent virus that has led to a record daily 2820 infections. It has the worst death rate of any Nordic country. Europe is, however, being outpaced by the US. Despite Donald Trump’s constant refrain that “we’re rounding the turn” and “it’ll disappear soon”, with daily infection rates not seen since the start of the pandemic. On Friday, 99,321 new cases were recorded — the fifth daily record set by the US over an eight-day period. The University of Washington forecasts the US COVID-19 death toll will be 400,000 by the end of the year. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US’s leading infectious diseases expert, says the country is “in for a whole lot of hurt … you could not be positioned more poorly”. Stanford University estimates 700 people have died and 30,000 have been infected by attending 18 of Mr Trump’s election rallies. On our first national zero community transmission day since June 9, Australia has much to be thankful for. But the virus’s surging across Europe and the US is a warning. We do not want to be forced into another crippling lockdown.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Even if you’ve been involved in property and houses all your [... ] [Derived headline ]	The New Zealand Herald	Even if you’ve been involved in property and houses all your life, selling your own home is still a big step. Sometimes a house just grabs your heart and you never want to leave; for others a house is a project to enjoy and then move on.
The owners of this week’s cover house thought of themselves as serial house movers, until they found their generous home, complete with a tennis court, pool and room for three boys and the crowds they attract. Fifteen years later they’re only just letting the house itch move them on.
For the owners of the striking Grey Lynn villa transformation on page 5, it was about cleverly rearranging two separate living spaces back into one gracious home, adding back in historic elements along with practical family-friendly details.
From carefully renovated bungalows in Remuera and Mt Albert to a compact city flat that borrows greenery from the neighbouring park and a new development in Manurewa’s Wattle Park, we’re covering both old and new ways of living in Auckland.
The summer market is the hottest it has been for several years, with plenty of excitement in the auction rooms, pre-auction offers and some great sales. Make the most of your house hunting.

Free lunch may prove costly on reflection	The New Zealand Herald	Even in times of chaos, there is no such thing as a free lunch.
The terms of the Government’s wage subsidy scheme — clearly billed as a “high trust” model — may have made it a very easy decision to accept the payment initially.
But such a decision quickly became public. Unlike most other welfare payments, the Ministry of Social Development allows the database of recipients of the subsidy to be searched.
This may have been done to ensure employees could check whether they were being told the truth by their bosses during the lockdown, but it also opened the payments up to another test: Public opinion of worthiness.
NZME, owner of the Herald, has taken the subsidy, amid redundancies and requests for staff to take temporary pay cuts, as ad revenue declined.
Whether it is retirement care companies, airports, private schools, foreign-owned meat companies or big law firms, chatter began about whether the businesses had really seen a drop in demand, or even if they had, whether they needed the money.
The Government should not be blamed for the scramble. As even National Party leader Simon Bridges acknowledges, it was crucial that the scheme created as few hurdles as possible so that the money could be paid out quickly.
By that measure, the scheme is a spectacular success, with more than $10 billion paid out.
But the inevitable result is that people who have little real need for the money will also take it.
Now, employers must decide if they needed the money more than they needed the fact that they had reached for taxpayer aid as part of their brand.
Fonterra chief executive Miles Hurrell summed up the quandary, saying while the dairy co-op may have been able to read its accounts in a way which could justify claiming the subsidy, he wouldn’t want to “look straight down the camera” and explain why.
A day earlier, he’d questioned whether Chinese-controlled rival Mataura Valley Milk was a worthy recipient, given it was choosing not to process milk Fonterra must supply it at a subsidised price, citing what he believed were false grounds about health.
Fonterra’s decision is more significant than it might appear, given that as a co-op it is far harder for it to raise capital than its privately owned rivals.
Meanwhile, Simpson Grierson and MinterEllisonRuddWatts, two of NZ’s biggest law firms, have repaid more than $2 million each in wage subsidies, saying they had not seen the drop in demand they expected when lockdown began.
We should take them at their word, both that the concerns about revenue and the desire to keep the firm’s workforce employed, was the genuine reason for applying for the money. But the speed with which the firms acted as public unrest about the payments began to build suggests the partners saw considerable risk associated, so soon after a decade of uninterrupted economic growth.
As the country inches towards a move down the Covid-19 alert level, other recipients might review whether justifying the decision to keep the money is more costly than repaying it.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics

Go Local will help soften post-Covid-19 impact	The Daily Post	Everyone across Taupo, Turangi, Mangakino and indeed the whole country, should feel immensely proud of what we have collectively achieved over the past four weeks.
We’ve held strong through nearly five weeks of level 4 lockdown and we’re slowly climbing back up the levels towards that far-off goal that is normal life.
But while our district has managed to get off relatively lightly in terms of Covid-19 infection, locking down our lives has come at a cost.
Being unable to move freely has meant many local businesses have been unable to operate for an extended period, affecting the livelihoods of owners, managers and staff. Many businesses remain restricted under level 3.
But one bright sign has been the ingenuity shown by those making the situation work for them.
During level 4, essential businesses such as supermarkets altered the way they work to keep their staff and the public safe while continuing to provide the things people really needed, while others adapted their offerings to offer an online platform and contactless delivery.
When level 3 arrived last week other businesses such as cafes worked out how to retain a storefront presence as well as online and found smart ways to keep social distancing between staff and customers. Still more are delivering piano lessons, Pilates classes, art tutorials and drama via Zoom.
It’s been an unsettling new world, and everybody has had to move fast.
While support such as wage subsidies and in some cases rent relief has helped, for many of our local businesses, the post-Covid-19 impact is only just starting to bite and there are fears not all will survive.
But there is hope. As a district, we showed an incredible amount of determination during the level 4 lockdown. Local police praised people’s willingness to stay home, stay in their bubble and stop the spread. We pulled together to look after our whanau, our friends and our wider community.
Now attention turns to the next step. We know that for many, times are hard. Jobs have been lost, businesses are reeling and the future is uncertain. And so we must pull together again.
I know that money is tight. But let’s spread around what we do have. Our supermarkets have been amazing at keeping the shelves stocked and everyone fed during the lockdown, and we will all continue to use them. But now, if you can, it’s time to spread the love by extending that food spend to our butchers, our bakers, our greengrocers, our specialty stores. Don’t forget the restaurants and cafes who are providing takeaways and home-delivered meals, our fish’n chip and burger shops and, yes, even our fast-food outlets because they provide jobs too.
Food aside, when the time comes for the rest of our district’s shops to reopen, think of using them first.
If the backside fell out of your favourite tracksuit pants from lockdown overuse, replace them with a pair from a local business. If your walking shoes imploded while you were pounding the pavement during level 4, find a pair in your town to buy. Forget the cheap clothing from Aliexpress and Wish. Buy fewer things but buy them here and help keep a shop open, an employee in a job, a business afloat, a family fed.
And when the time comes that we can all move around freely, if you’d planned a trip away you can no longer take, think about having it here instead. So many of us have never been to Orakei Korako, taken a boat cruise to the modern Maori carvings, soaked in a hot pool at Wairakei Terraces or rafted the mighty Tongariro River. Now is the time.
With the Go Local! campaign we will bring you over the coming weeks stories of local business innovation and success, inspirational thinking and telling you how you can play a part in rebuilding our local economy.
It is vital for our local economy and our overall wellbeing that each one of us does what we can to help by buying local goods and choosing local services.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Less hot air, more gas supply	The Australian	Everyone talks about energy, but rational policy is needed
A short-term political fix often ends up worsening the problem it’s supposed to cure. This is the policy lesson of the mess that is Australia’s east coast gas market, a lesson reinforced by Geoff Chambers’s report on Wednesday about Productivity Commission advice put to a Senate committee inquiry into oil and gas reserves. The broader context is the contradiction between our enviable abundance of fuel sources and our lack of rational energy policy, especially in the states. Economic growth is sluggish and the need to maintain affordable, efficient energy inputs is vital. At the same time, as climate change drives the shift to more sustainable energy, natural gas has an important role to play as a bridging supply of baseload power.
But there are perverse policy settings. And under political pressure the Coalition created a measure that in an “emergency” can restrict our booming exports of gas on the basis that domestic supply is insufficient. Our export success should be celebrated. It’s a source of prosperity and underpins further productive investment. And, as the Productivity Commission argues in its submission, domestic reservation could very well backfire.
It could put downward pressure on domestic wholesale gas prices. “The gap created between domestic prices in the eastern market and export prices likely under such a policy would especially weaken incentives to invest in projects that would produce solely for the eastern market,” the commission says, with the result of “imposing net costs on the community”. Less investment leads to less supply and higher prices in the long run.
The better response is to tackle the long-deferred task of serious energy policy reform, and a good place to start is coal-seam gas exploration. Concern about health, safety and ecology has inspired state-based restrictions. In NSW, a freeze of exploration has ended but the government shows little sign of being proactive on the granting of new licences. In Victoria, it’s against the law to do any onshore unconventional gas exploration or development. That moratorium runs to June 30 and should be reconsidered.Of course the risks posed by any economic activity must be assessed carefully. But, as the commission points out, there are myriad forms of land use unlikely to be totally free of environmental effects yet these encounter little opposition because they are more familiar than coal-seam gas projects. And the cost of such resource restrictions has to be taken into account. Without affordable power, businesses may shelve expansion plans, shed workers or shut down. Higher bills for householders may be felt in weaker retail spending. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission’s Rod Sims is right to argue for new low-cost gas supply in southern states to relieve price pressures in the market. It’s time for policymakers, notably in the state capitals, to get on the case.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Moral hazard of acting too soon on Whyalla steel mill	The Australian	Experience shows government involvement can make things worse Corporate history is littered with examples of charismatic business leaders with big ideas who got close to government before abruptly disappearing from view in a sea of debt. Often they have involved innovative finance and investment schemes that ended up being little more than new ways to pass big risks to unsuspecting ordinary investors. The list includes the junk bond-led savings and loans affair of 1980 and the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 that melted Wall Street and prompted the global financial crisis. The list of colourful business identities who soared, showed off and crashed includes Alan Bond and Christopher Skase in Australia. Companies that promised new ways to riches but imploded with billions in losses include US energy company Enron and Australian insurer HIH, which foundered after being caught overvaluing its assets and underestimating liabilities. The record of corporate greed and misadventure can be traced all the way back to the Medici Bank collapse of 1494, the South Sea Bubble of 1720 and the Poseidon nickel boom of 1969. A common feature is that when things go bad, governments are called on to become a lender of last resort, and taxpayers are asked to assume risks that the private sector will not.
The unfolding disaster of the Greensill financing business collapse and resultant squeeze on Sanjeev Gupta’s global steelmaking and commodities enterprise follows a familiar pattern. Both Mr Gupta and Lex Greensill were notable for their close links to government and lavish lifestyles, which included big mansions and country estates across continents and fleets of corporate jets in which to visit them. Mr Greensill started out from a farm in Bundaberg in Queensland with a plan to help agricultural businesses improve the predictability of their cashflow. At the end he had managed to insert his business into the heart of how the British government managed its money. Greensill soared with the active support and lobbying efforts of former British prime minister David Cameron, while former Australian foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop reportedly attempted to bring Greensill financing to the Australian public sector.
Along the way Greensill became the major funder for Mr Gupta’s rapidly expanding empire, which has assembled a global collection of formerly depressed steelmaking businesses. Flitting between trophy homes in London, the Middle East and Sydney, Mr Gupta has spruiked a big plan to make his steel businesses not only profitable but also transformed into a low carbon emissions showcase in keeping with the green ideals of the times.
Greensill’s business imploded when German insurers baulked at the company’s exposure to Mr Gupta’s debt-laden empire. Mr Gupta is fighting for his corporate life as Greensill Capital has been put into administration and lenders seek to recover their money.
There is a long way to go to unravel the opaque and byzantine deals and corporate structures that define Mr Gupta’s business and its relationship with Greensill. Mr Gupta says his company has no immediate requirement to repay Greensill and he is confident that new commercial lenders can be found to keep the steel businesses afloat. But with administrators appointed to Greensill, a court action has been lodged by Citibank to wind up Mr Gupta’s OneSteel Manufacturing, owner of the Whyalla steelworks in South Australia. Similar actions have been launched against Mr Gupta’s other assets around the world by Credit Suisse. Already the call has been made for government to step in and help safeguard the future of the strategically important Whyalla steelworks.
So far the British government has refused a bailout for Mr Gupta’s assets there. Australia, despite the strategic and regional importance of the Whyalla steelmaking facility, would be wise to follow suit. The Morrison government has confirmed it is working on a back-up plan to keep the Whyalla steelworks afloat but it has given no details. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall has signalled his government may be prepared to step in with bridging finance, but experience shows government involvement often can make things worse.
The West Australian government’s bailout of Laurie Connell’s merchant bank, Rothwells Ltd, following the 1987 sharemarket crash cost taxpayers billions and lifted the lid on WA Inc. The collapse of the State Bank of Victoria in 1990 was a key factor in the defeat of the state Labor government led by Joan Kirner. Similarly, the crash of the government-owned State Bank of South Australia in 1991 led to the resignation of Labor premier John Bannon the following year. A succession of sharemarket crashes since then has shown that most often it is simply not possible to avoid the inevitable. Moral hazard dictates that bad businesses be allowed to fail. This does not mean Australia inevitably will lose the ability to make steel or Whyalla its much-needed jobs. But key crossbench senator Rex Patrick was right when he said rather than stepping in and propping up a billionaire who had run into trouble the government should make it clear that it stood by Whyalla and its workers. There is a lot of financial and legal manoeuvring to go before any meaningful action by government will be sensible or possible.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Swimming needs a fresh start	The Australian	FINA must be reformed to ensure fair competition in future
Most Australians’ favourite sporting memories include at least one triumph in an Olympic pool. Shane Gould in Munich in 1972, Kieren Perkins winning the 1500m freestyle gold in lane eight at Atlanta in 1996, the men’s 4x100m freestyle relay team beating Team USA in Sydney in 2000 and our women winning the same event in London and Rio spring to mind. Swimming champions have long been afforded star billing in our national pantheon, which is why sports fans recognise that the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s decision to ban Chinese cheat Sun Yang for eight years is just and courageous. It offers the chance of a much needed fresh start in a sport that has been overseen for too long by the dead hand of FINA, its peak administrative body. In reaching its judgment, the court overturned FINA’s astonishing decision last year when it cleared Sun of all wrongdoing, despite the destruction of his drug-testing results in September 2018. In a clash with drug testers, a security guard from Sun’s entourage reportedly used a hammer to destroy a container with a vial of the swimmer’s blood sample. Sun tested positive to a banned stimulant during China’s 2014 championships. He was suspended for three months.
Olympic gold medallist Cate Campbell said on Monday that tough questions need to be asked of FINA. They do. The organisation then needs a clean-out and an overhaul. To the detriment of the sport, its soft pedalling on doping stretches back at least two generations. Wayne Smith, who has covered swimming since the early 1970s — the era of Steve Holland and Tracey Wickham — recounted on Monday how FINA turned a blind eye to the systemic cheating of the East Germans in the 70s and 80s. Their doping program, which left athletes ill and infertile, was exposed after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. It was followed by similar official cheating by the Chinese. China cleaned up its act, but rogue cheats such as Sun persisted.
Of the many frustrated Australian, US and other athletes who urged FINA to stamp out cheating, none has been more effective than freestyle Olympic gold medallist Mack Horton, who labelled Sun a drug cheat at Rio in 2016. When Horton swam second to Sun in the 400m freestyle at the world championships in South Korea last year, he knew what he was expected to do. That, as Smith wrote, was to “accept his silver medal with a smile, shake hands with his fellow medallists, smile for the cameras and then disappear”. But Horton could not do it. He refused to share the podium with Sun.
FINA’s response illustrates why its leadership should go. It formally cautioned Swimming Australia. FINA executive director Cornel Marculescu, who had hugged Sun Yang as he stepped off the podium in Rio in 2016, accused Horton of jealousy. Mr Marculescu, 78, is a former Romanian water polo player who has held office in Lausanne, Switzerland, since 1986. FINA president Julio Maglione, the president of the Uruguayan Olympic Committee, is 84. Sports officials who enjoy the perks of international travel and the best seats at competitions need to be responsible and uphold rigorous standards. FINA’s hierarchy needs fresh blood and expertise, drawn from nations with a strong interest in swimming and fair play.Part of the problem is that under current rules the US and Australia, which rank first and second in Olympic swimming medals, and other competitive swimming nations have no more say in running the sport than landlubber members. The structure needs updating. Athletes in North American and Europe are already voting with their feet, joining a rival swimming competition launched last year, the International Swimming League. As Smith wrote, this is the moment for reform. The Court of Arbitration’s ban is a major embarrassment for FINA and a wake-up call that something is deeply wrong in one of the Olympics’ main attractions, for which tickets sell faster than any other sport. Australia, which has always stood firm against cheating, is well placed to help lead reform. Plenty of our ex-Olympians such as Perkins and Madame Butterfly, Susie O’Neill, would be ideal board members.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Now look who’s playing politics with COVID-19	The Australian	Fear and frustration drive Victoria’s Premier For self-awareness, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews could well reflect on his choice of words in Monday’s unwarranted and extraordinary outburst against Josh Frydenberg.
“It’s all about the politics with this bloke,” said Andrews. Clearly keeping politics out of it, the Labor Premier said the federal Treasurer was “not a leader, he’s just a Liberal”.
And in his view, Mr Frydenberg, who lives in Melbourne and is responsible for JobKeeper and other measures that sustain Victoria’s feeble economic heartbeat, was “not for Victoria”.
These are the words of frustration from a man who fears losing control. Having failed to fully deliver on his promise of a week ago to ease restrictions and get Victoria back to business, Mr Andrews has instead resorted to distraction, victimhood and partisan divide. He laments that opponents cannot appreciate the nuance of Victoria health modelling under which very low infection rates do not mean that things are safe.
The Premier’s histrionic rebuke of visiting New Zealanders, who burst Victoria’s bubble, may have touched a xenophobic nerve in the electorate but it has been based on utter confusion. It should not have been news to Mr Andrews but Victoria’s health department website says the state’s borders are open to New Zealanders who travel via NSW. “If you are travelling from NZ and have passed all relevant immigration and biosecurity requirements as established by the federal government, NSW government and Northern Territory government, then you are able to travel to Victoria,” has been the official Victorian government position.
For the cameras, Mr Andrews has been insisting that he has more important things to do than to personally supervise unwanted guests from across the ditch — proof he considers himself a one-man band.
Mr Frydenberg is far from a lone voice in criticising Mr Andrews’s convoluted and overly cautious approach to easing COVID-19 restrictions. Commonwealth Bank chief Matt Comyn joined a chorus of business leaders on Monday urging Victoria to accelerate out of lockdown, warning of a “huge impact” to small business. All of the major business groups have given a similar appraisal.
Instead, Mr Andrews has outlined an overly bureaucratic, noodle nation of regulatory changes that on analysis amounts to not very much at all.
The big take-out is that business remains closed and people can travel further from home, but there will be little to do when they arrive at their destinations. Distance restrictions remain in place to stop people travelling to popular destinations along the Mornington Peninsula and city-dwellers are banned from visiting their rural getaway properties.
The weekend’s AFL grand final — the first time that two Victorian teams will contest the flag in almost a decade — must be celebrated at home, without friends. Small business in Melbourne has been left to whistle, and wither. Rural Victorians have fared marginally better but remain heavily regulated.
Federal politicians and business leaders are right to pressure Mr Andrews to allow Victoria to move more quickly out of lockdown. Bringing Victoria out of the deep freeze will be crucial to Deloitte Access Economics’ estimates of a strong national recovery from the health crisis.
Behind Mr Andrews’s words of concern are perverse actions that sit at stark odds with his claims of not being political. There are clear winners and losers in the Andrews COVID-19 roadmap and they align with the self-interest of the Victorian ALP.
As John Ferguson has written, Victorian Labor owes its electoral success in large measure to its ability to win key marginal seats that are a focus of the government’s “ring of steel” approach to combating COVID-19.
Eight non-metropolitan Labor seats are protected by the measures that prohibit city residents travelling to rural areas. Preserving the lockdown protects both the rural areas and the Victorian ALP’s electoral interests.
As for business, Ferguson writes that it has never been a favourite of the Andrews government, which has relied for support on spending programs that reward sectional interests.
Andrews’s focus is on his target supporters: public servants, unions, tradies, insecure workers, welfare recipients and construction. His disconnection from the private sector is shown by his advice to struggling small business owners that they should ask the government for help. Rather than rebuilding momentum in the private sector, Mr Andrews is pinning his hopes on an “unprecedented” surge in government spending in the upcoming state budget. This is the real divide between what is happening in NSW, where business is open and the economy is regaining strength, and Victoria, where lockdowns continue despite the now similar numbers of COVID-19 cases.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
EDITORIAL No excuse for violence directed at women	Hawkes Bay Today	Finally the Grace Millane murder trial has come to an end, with her killer jailed for life with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years.
For Grace’s family, dealing with the loss of their girl is only just beginning.
For the past two years, they’ve had a focus. They wanted to ensure the man who’d taken their daughter, sister and friend didn’t get away with murder. They sat through his trial day after day, not flinching when they heard evidence given about Grace’s personal life.
I’m not going to go into the details here but suffice it to say, there is no privacy or dignity when a person is murdered. Their life is laid bare within the cold, impersonal confines of a courtroom.
But the conviction of Grace’s murderer, who was found guilty by a jury in a unanimous verdict, was a vindication for Grace. Her life mattered.
Grace’s family opened Friday’s sentencing reading victim impact statements, underscoring their loss and their devastation.
But now it’s over. And the Millane family have to get on with living each day without her.
I can’t even begin to imagine the pain that they’re feeling. It’s incredible the way they have refused to allow her killer to dim her light.
They decided to channel their grief into a project for good and the Love Grace charity was launched in Britain.
Even in their pain and grief, the Millanes refuse to be brought low by an ugly, cruel act of depravity.
White Ribbon charity ambassador, Mark Longley, whose own daughter was murdered by her boyfriend, says Grace’s death must be a reminder that violence against women, in any form, is wrong and that it’s up to men to spread that message.
On the same day that Grace’s murderer was sentenced, fury was raging over statements made by the detective in charge of the murders of a woman and her three children in Australia.
They were burned alive by an angry vindictive husband and father, who would not contemplate them living outside of his control. Was this, mused Detective Inspector Mark Thompson, an issue of a woman suffering significant domestic violence and her and her children perishing at the hands of the husband? Or is it, he said, an instance of a husband being driven too far by issues that he’s suffered by certain circumstances into committing acts of this form?
How can he even begin to contemplate an excuse for burning alive three babies, strapped into their car seats, and their mother who only wanted to keep them safe?
Women shouldn’t be dying because a man’s ego is wounded or because he wants to act out a pornographic fantasy.
And yet they are. Of all victims killed by a partner or ex-partner in this country between 2004 and 2019, 75per cent were female and 25per cent male.
Yes, women can be abusive but they simply don’t kill men in the way men kill women. And it will be men, and only men, who can change this.

Glimmers of hope on jobs but economy needs fixing	The Australian	Finding the fiscal sweet spot has become even more difficult
On Thursday Scott Morrison declared “the Australian economy is fighting back”, as he accentuated the positive in the latest job figures. Last month, as restrictions were eased and employers opened doors to staff and customers, employment jumped by 210,800. The economy is clawing back its losses, with hours worked up as well. Women and young people, who have borne the worst of the shutdown, were at the forefront of the mini-revival. Some of those who’d fled the job market came back; the participation rate rose, while more available hours meant the under-utilisation rate, previously at a record high, eased. The headline jobless rate is 7.4 per cent, the highest in 22 years; the Morrison government concedes the true rate is around 13 per cent. The Prime Minister said these labour flows were evidence of more flexible practices, and that wage subsidies were helping workers stay in touch with employers in extraordinary times.
Preserving that link is behind the extension of the wage subsidy for apprentices in the government’s new skills package. There is a huge churn, and thus waste, in training young workers so they can eventually add more value to enterprises. Extra carrots for firms to keep juniors is a reasonable use of taxpayer dollars in a crisis that has savaged the prospects for the least experienced workers. So, too, is more spending on retraining older displaced workers for areas of job growth or skills deficit, especially as imported workers won’t be filling those vacancies any time soon. Canberra is injecting funds into vocational education and training, the province of the states, but is raising expectations on them to achieve better outcomes. The new funding model for training is akin to the health system’s.
VET has long been a neglected policy area, with the system overly complex and opaque for students and parents; different from state to state, in quality and cost; and slow to adjust to industry needs. Mr Morrison offers a lifeline to apprentices until next April, and a boost for school-leavers, but is also reshaping VET so recovery from the pandemic is not hindered. Jobs and skills needed then won’t necessarily be those lost due to COVID-19. Industry restructuring is not only inevitable but also welcome. To survive, businesses are trimming costs and innovating. As a nation, we need capital and labour flowing to high-value industries in the ascendancy; that’s the key to higher productivity, profits and wages. The Morrison government has facilitated an industrial truce of sorts, with unions and employer groups now trying to improve workplace flexibility, simplify awards and accelerate deal-making, among other matters. Their handiwork is due before the October budget.
Josh Frydenberg will provide an economic update on Thursday, including new arrangements for the emergency income supports that run out in late September. The Treasurer has vowed to help households and businesses, especially those exposed to international tourism, manage the transition. The six-week lockdown in Greater Melbourne will hinder the economy and lead to more job losses. The bottom-line budget numbers are likely to be ugly, then uglier, with private economists expecting a deficit of $100bn last financial year and double that for the current one, or 10 per cent of gross domestic product. Extending JobKeeper, or permanently raising JobSeeker substantially, would put the budget further into the red. But not spending more now would lead to lower GDP, higher unemployment and more debt. Snapback is now far less likely, so the Treasurer has an invidious task in finding the fiscal sweet spot. Yet the main game has not changed. As Mr Morrison recognised in talking up the job numbers, we need a resilient spirit and a more supple economy to regain the lost ground. He has set a bold goal of GDP growth of 3.75 per cent a year for the next five years. On current settings we can’t achieve that; perhaps only in the theoretical nirvana known as Modern Monetary Theory could we engineer that, and hope nobody calls in our tab. The Morrison government has sent faint signals, but not much more, that during this crisis we must repair Australia’s supply side — and go for growth. We have a chance to fix the economy’s rusty pipes, ditch its ancient processes and tribal enmities, make it respond better to price signals, get more from our precious capital and upgrade the skills of workers. It’s the least we need to compete in a COVID-ravaged, slow-growth, high-stress world.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Israel opts for political stability	The Australian	Firm leadership will help the Jewish state secure its future
After being on the brink of political oblivion, Benjamin Netanyahu has rebounded in Israel’s third general election in 11 months — a remarkable achievement. With counting continuing, exit polls indicate his Likud party coalition with right-wing religious parties is likely to secure 59 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, two shy of the 61 seats needed for a majority. Mr Netanyahu should be able to pick up the last two seats from among independents and potential defectors from Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party. It won about 34 seats in a disappointing outcome.
Mr Netanyahu immediately claimed he had won a “gigantic victory”. After the political instability that has bedevilled Israel for 15 months, his euphoria is understandable. But he would do well to eschew triumphalism. While the result seems to assure him of a historic fifth term, it does not obscure the deep divisions in Israeli society. The past year’s two inconclusive elections and the inability of Mr Netanyahu or Mr Gantz to cobble together a new government revealed an electorate split down the middle. The pendulum has moved slightly but significantly in Mr Netanyahu’s favour.
Given Israel’s existential challenges, especially Iranian aggression, Mr Netanyahu should build a broad coalition beyond his alliance with religious parties. After the inconclusive election in September last year, he proposed a national unity government with Mr Gantz, with the two leaders alternating as prime minister in the way Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir did so well in 1984. Despite keen support from President Reuven Rivlin, Mr Gantz climbed on to his high horse and refused to work with a prime minister under indictment for corruption.Despite his electoral success, Mr Netanyahu is not out of the woods. Barring legislation being rushed through to thwart the legal process, he will face charges in court on March 17. Voters appear to be sceptical about the allegations and expect he will be cleared. That remains to be seen. What is clear is that Israelis are tired of instability and political squabbling and want their leaders to start governing. The security of the unique democracy that is the Jewish state demands no less.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Medicare-style aged care an issue for taxpayers	The Australian	Fixing a broken system will have to come at a considerable cost Distilled to its essence, the final report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety says decades of ambivalence and mismanagement by government will require billions of dollars and an ongoing 1 per cent taxation surcharge to fix. There is disagreement between the two commissioners about whether the funds should be ring-fenced as a hypothecated levy or be part of general revenue. Also in dispute is whether the government and existing agencies can be trusted to oversee an expanded aged-care budget.
But agreement is universal on the points that matter. These include that current funding is insufficient and insecure; the system is understaffed and the workforce underpaid and undertrained; too often regulators have been asleep at the wheel; and the complex capital financing arrangements, including the widely used refundable accommodation system, are not working.
In response to the traumatic stories of abuse and neglect given as evidence to the inquiry, commissioners Tony Pagone QC and Lynette Briggs say the aged-care sector is pervaded by substandard care and abuse that in the extreme reaches into the realm of criminal behaviour. They say a new act is required to achieve the fundamental reforms that put older people’s needs and wellbeing first.
The inability of the commissioners to reach consensus is unfortunate and will give some room for government to delay. Scott Morrison’s first response, to boost aged-care funding by $452.2m, can be seen only as a down payment on what the royal commission’s final report says is required. The division also has disappointed witnesses to the royal commission, who say the report is derelict in its failure to provide a clear and authoritative road map for recalcitrant government. What is clear from the report, and the many who have come before the royal commission, is that the problems have not arisen overnight — and that as the population continues to age, the issue will become only more important.
The inquiry report sets out the numbers. It is projected the number of Australians aged 85 and older will increase from 515,700 in 2018-19 (2 per cent of the population) to more than 1.5 million by 2058 (3.7 per cent of the population). In 2019, there were 4.2 working-age people (aged 15 to 64) for every Australian aged 65 or older. By 2058, this will have decreased to 3.1. While most of the aged-care budget is spent on residential aged care, more than two-thirds of people using aged-care services do so from home. The federal government is the main funder of aged care, and across the next decade spending on aged care will increase by 4 per cent a year, significantly faster than the rate of all federal government spending. Also across the next decade, aged care will account for 5 per cent of all federal government expenditure, compared with 4.2 per cent in 2018-19.
While aged care is a growth sector, it is not always profitable for those who deliver the service, with 31 per cent of home-care providers and 42 per cent of residential aged-care providers reporting an operating loss in 2018-19. The remedy put forward in the royal commission report is for a system of universal entitlement similar to Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and the Age Pension. All basic aged-care services will be available to citizens free of charge, whether at home or in an aged-care facility. The commissioners say there should be no requirement to pay a co-contribution towards care in any community setting or residential aged care, including respite. Because all Australians should have an entitlement to aged care, the costs of care should be distributed equitably across the community. To get things moving, the commissioners say the federal government should clear the home-care package waiting list by immediately increasing the packages available. The government should keep the waiting list clear by allocating a home-care package to any new entrants to the waiting list within one month of the date of their assessment. The government also should provide capital for new aged-care residential facilities in which residents should not be responsible for their care costs but should be required to contribute to their ordinary costs of living and accommodation at a rate set as a percentage of the Age Pension. Where the commissioners differ, it is that Mr Pagone thinks the aged-care sector should have greater independence from government. Ms Briggs believes reforming existing institutions will deliver aged-care reform more quickly and effectively. She says it would not be acceptable to taxpayers for more than $30bn of taxpayer funds to be handed over every year to non-elected individuals operating outside the direct control of ministers to be spent as they saw fit. In opting for universal coverage to be funded through the tax system, the royal commission’s findings avoid the debate over selling the family home and inheritance planning that has plagued discussions in the past. But nothing comes for free, just as taxpayer funds are not a magic pudding that can keep on giving.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Crisis opens new opportunities	The Australian	Flexibility will be more important in post-COVID workplaces
Indigenous leader Noel Pearson warned on Wednesday that COVID-19 government support measures were fuelling a surge in “grog chaos and gambling” in vulnerable communities from Cape York to the Pilbara. The problem is an example of adverse unintended consequences arising from good policies such as the JobSeeker supplement. Problems also have been rife at Wadeye, 400km southwest of Darwin. There, school attendance has fallen to about 30 per cent since the government’s coronavirus supplement effectively doubled welfare payments, leading to widespread alcohol abuse. However complex, the best answers to such upheavals are personal responsibility and local leadership. Given the magnitude of the pandemic, which to date has caused 823,000 deaths from 24 million known cases around the world, unintended consequences, good and bad, will extend far beyond health and economic upheaval. They are already changing how we live and work and what we buy, producing opportunities as well as problems. Enterprising designers, for instance, are refining the “working from home” look — haute hoodies — as fashion editor Glynis Traill-Nash has written. Working remotely will create opportunities for more people to live outside capital cities, boosting regional Australia. It could help create jobs in remote communities.
With almost two-thirds of federal public servants, about 93,000 staff, working from home, government ministers and senior mandarins are concerned about substandard “pyjama policymaking”, the potential waste of government office space and rising costs to taxpayers, as Tom Dusevic wrote on Tuesday. Concerns also have arisen in the services sector that by continuing to work remotely, the younger generation of lawyers, architects and accountants, especially new staff, will miss out on the practical benefits of mentoring in workplaces by experienced professionals. But resisting staff preferences for WFH will be problematic for many managers in the post-COVID world. To do so would be to risk losing some of their best people.
The Australian has long recognised that flexibility is essential to efficient, modern workplaces. Too often it has been resisted, unfortunately, by some unions that prefer rigid, prescriptive awards and centralised oversight of wages and conditions. WFH, however, should take us into a new era in which flexibility and co-operation will be increasingly important to boost productivity. Reform will be essential if young people are to enjoy living standards on a par with those their parents took for granted until recently. Before COVID-19, Helen Trinca has reported, fewer than 2 per cent of employees worked mostly at home, and only about one-third did any work at home. That situation has been blamed mainly on bosses’ reluctance to allow staff out of their sight. Perceptions have now changed, with workplace surveys showing 60 to 75 per cent of workers and managers now expect some level of WFH to become permanent. In recent months millions of Australians have discovered the advantages of WFH: reduced commuting time, better work-life balance and flexibility. It is flexibility, for staff and employers, that can help boost productivity as industries gear up again to full throttle. Details are often best decided in workplaces. But the states, as is their wont, are taking a bureaucratic approach to the new world of work. NSW and Victoria, Adam Creighton has written, are advertising 20 high-paid jobs requiring skills in “change, culture, transformation and strategy”. The jobs carry titles such as “director of intersectionality and inclusion” (salary $249,000) at Victoria’s Justice Department. The Australian Industry Group has noted that WFH has shown the benefits of not running traditional office environments. WFH would be a draw, it said, for companies to attract talent when many people did not want to travel for more than 45 minutes to work. A concept once reserved for senior leaders and a lucky few “may just be the lifeline that organisations need to keep their heads above water on the balance sheet”. Making it work, regardless of unintended consequences, will be the challenge.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Labor must refresh agenda as nation goes for growth	The Australian	For Anthony Albanese, Corbyn-19 is a political dead end
Scott Morrison has asked for fresh ideas and eyes for a growth agenda to guide the nation’s emergence from the coronavirus pandemic. The Prime Minister wants a business-led recovery, with private enterprises roaring out of the abyss, investing, employing, innovating and competing on world markets. He envisages business, unions and community groups combining to fashion a new consensus on reform. It sounds so 1980s — the era of tripartite summits, accords and deregulation, led by Bob Hawke, Paul Keating and the ACTU’s Bill Kelty. Mr Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have unleashed the biggest fiscal splurge in our history to keep companies operating and to hold on to workers amid unprecedented restrictions to suppress COVID-19 infection rates. But the goal is to restore an open, market-based economy, not one controlled from Canberra.
This is not an ideological odyssey but a return to the successful homegrown model that has seen our living standards double during the past four decades. Are readers aware of any alternative approaches? From his reliable interview perch at the ABC, Anthony Albanese has emerged as a voice for mixing it up. Why? For brand differentiation alone, because that’s how we’ve done politics since reform’s halcyon days, when bipartisanship, trade-offs and persuasive policy sales pitches came together in the national interest. The Morrison government wisely rebuffed Virgin Australia’s lunge for taxpayers’ wallets. Mr Albanese haphazardly would have gone further into debt to buy a stake in the carrier, propping up the foreign shareholders who are responsible for its capital crisis. Senior Labor MPs argue Canberra should take a stake in all critical businesses facing hardship. It’s 2020, folks, but mind the thundering herd that now demands a handout.
A year ago, voters rejected Bill Shorten’s neo-interventionism: a living wage, greenhouse gas abatement at any cost, $387bn in new taxes. Mr Albanese declared he would ditch the class-war rhetoric and redistributive agenda. The Opposition Leader promised to work with business to grow the economy; he even may have mentioned Hawke and Mr Keating as inspirations, but this vibe has evaporated. There is a buzz around a new productivity agenda; it’s driven by top mandarins, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe and Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy, as well as the business lobby and eminences such as Peter Costello, Ken Henry and Ian Harper. Naturally the emphasis is on improving our supply side, focusing on tax, infrastructure, education and training, regulation and industrial relations. As well, there are big issues such as energy policy, manufacturing and federal financial relations.
Confronted by experts advocating debate about solutions, you would hope Mr Albanese would lead with a positive mindset, given his tangential role in dealing with the immediate medical and economic calamities. But as we seek a fast-growth exit from the morass, his first instinct has been to play the spoiler. In his view, cutting company tax or making our workplaces more flexible is akin to “let it rip for market forces”, that the government is pursuing an “old right-wing agenda”. Yet this is central to the wishlist of our best economic brains. What’s the plan to pay back the debt, Labor asks. But in the next sentence it backs a range of schemes to increase permanently the footprint of government, whether higher welfare payments, social housing or madcap industry policy.It’s true Mr Albanese, as a student activist, often railed against Labor’s pro-market reforms. As the alternative prime minister, however, he must recognise virulent Corbyn-19 is a dead end, personally and politically. In a nutshell, our exit strategy must be to go for growth, driven by the private sector. It means employers working with their employees to drive efficiencies — to work smarter, with superior tools and to produce better goods and services. That’s the main game for the labour movement and business leaders, a win-win for the nation. Co-operation will also rebuild confidence; there can’t be a recovery without it. On Thursday Mr Morrison said the government would not only be “harvesting” the best policy options of the past decade but also inviting fresh thinking for a new world, with a view to putting Australia in an even stronger position in the future. A positive, practical and ambitious policy contribution from Labor, in its best traditions, will help us reach higher.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
EDITORIAL US fears about safety high in minds of voters	The Northern Advocate	For all the words about facts, numbers and policy, elections often come down more to emotion and gut instinct than reason.
Are you better off than before? Can you trust the people in charge? Would the new team be better?
Americans have been offered two distinct paths towards the November election after the party conventions of the past two weeks.
The key question both main United States parties are primarily asking is: Are you safe?
The US is nearing six million coronavirus cases and 182,000 deaths. Case numbers have been falling lately but it is hard to predict what the situation will be in November. With the pandemic comes job, home, health, and food insecurity. The unemployment rate is still 10.2 per cent. Parents are concerned about their children in schools.
Polls show the pandemic is the issue of most importance to voters. A Morning Consult poll on Saturday showed a slight uptick in approval for Donald Trump’s handling of the virus from 36 per cent in late July to 39 per cent now.
The Democratic case is that Trump and Mike Pence politicised their handling of the US outbreak and made it worse than it could have been. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris say Trump’s record shows he is not up to the job.
Republicans blame China for the virus, highlight early travel bans, point to efforts working with states, and a push for medical remedies. Health experts and critics contend protective equipment was initially insufficient, travel bans still let thousands of people through, states were forced to scramble for supplies, there was never a co-ordinated national plan, and testing has never reached the necessary levels.
The convention focused on law and order, with Trump and Pence seizing on rioting that have followed some peaceful racial justice protests, to warn that voters “won’t be safe in Biden’s America”.
The safety pitch may appeal to some moderate Republicans and Independents in swing states who drifted away from Trump.
Biden has supported the right to protest, acknowledged racial inequality and condemned police brutality. He has also spoken out against rioting and said he does not want to “defund” the police. The Democrats want to keep the election focused on the coronavirus and jobs, and just how safe people feel now in Trump’s America. Fears about safety will be key to the election outcome.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses

Americans have been offered two distinct paths towards the November election after the party conventions of the past two weeks.

With the pandemic comes job, home, health, and food insecurity. Millions of jobs have been recovered but the unemployment rate is still 10.2 per cent. Parents are concerned about their children in schools.
Polls show the pandemic is the prime issue for voters. A Morning Consult poll on Saturday showed a slight uptick in approval for Donald Trump’s handling of the virus from 36 per cent in late July to 39 per cent now.
The Democratic case is that Trump and Mike Pence politicised their handling of the US outbreak and made it worse than it could have been. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris charge that Trump’s character and record show he is not up to the job.
Republicans blame China for the virus, highlight early travel bans, point to efforts working with states, and a push for medical remedies. Health experts and critics contend that protective equipment was initially insufficient, travel bans still let thousands of people through, states were forced to scramble for supplies, there was never a co-ordinated national plan, and testing has never reached the necessary levels.
The convention instead focused on law and order, with Trump and Pence seizing on incidents of rioting that have followed some peaceful protests, to warn that voters “won’t be safe in Biden’s America”. But such violence is actually happening in Trump’s America.
The safety pitch may appeal to some moderate Republicans and Independents in swing states who drifted away from Trump. He has to convince them to return.
Biden has supported the right to protest, acknowledged racial inequality and condemned police brutality. He has also spoken out against rioting and said he does not want to “defund”’ the police. The Democrats want to keep the election focused on the coronavirus and jobs, and just how safe people feel in Trump’s America. Fears about safety will be key to the election outcome.

EDITORIAL Scientists issue another wake-up call	Hawkes Bay Today	For those hardy few souls still clinging to a view that the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic has been overstated, yesterday’s tranche of mathematical modelling may be hard to explain away.
The Ministry of Health yesterday released the series of modelling — all looking at how a range of measures could help reduce the impact of Covid-19. The reports were completed by Wellington researchers from the University of Otago in collaboration with colleagues from Germany.
The models were revised based on feedback from peer reviewers, the Ministry of Health’s chief science adviser and public health officials.
Modelling such as this is not pie-in-the-sky. It is based on real data of human movement from sources such as mobile phones and GPS. This is then overlaid on our population statistics and what we know about the rates of transmission.
Two years ago, the BBC commissioned a documentary programme which used a public experiment to simulate the outbreak of a flu pandemic. Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic used a smartphone app that tracked participants’ movements and contact with other people throughout the day.
Mathematicians at the University of Cambridge and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used the data to build and run a model of how a pandemic would spread.
They found a worst-case scenario would infect more than 40 million people, with a death toll of up to 886,000.
The latest modelling provides a similarly daunting potential.
Earlier this week, the Herald revealed the modelling by Otago University researchers found as many as 14,000 people could die if Covid-19 spreads out of control in New Zealand — and potentially as many as 27,600 in another modelled scenario. Uncontrolled spread throughout the country could infect up to 64 per cent of the population, with 32,000 people needing hospital treatment.
This is clearly what our Government is trying to avoid. Tens of thousands needing treatment would overwhelm the health system, infect hospital staff and leave the nation at the mercy of an out-of-control contagion.
This has tragically been seen in Italy and Spain and is being predicted by some experts for parts of the United States.
New Zealand Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said: “The modelling shows that without the actions currently being taken, the uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 would exact a high price in New Zealand in terms of its impact on our health services, including our intensive care units, and deaths.”
The modelling is a warning, with a sheen of hope.
Factored in is New Zealand’s island nation status, low population density and limited mass transport.
These may all help reduce the impact here.
Do the right thing and we will get through this.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease

EDITORIALDegrees of separation working from home	The Daily Post	For those lucky enough to still have work in the lockdown the once infrequent task of working from home has become a normal reality for many.
New Zealand has entered a state of emergency and Covid-19 alert level 4, meaning apart from those working in frontline essential service industries, we’re now required to live in complete lockdown.
We shouldn’t be leaving our homes or communities unless we need essential services such as food from dairies or supermarkets, or healthcare. This means the ultimate in bringing work home with you for others not on the frontline, journalists included.
But if you’re like me, there needs to be some level of separation between home and work to be productive in either setting. In my case, that means taking steps to trick my mind into believing the two — even though they’ve merged — do not clash.
The mug I use for my morning work coffee does not match the set in my home. My lunch is pre-packed and sits in the fridge in a storage container as it would in a fridge at work.
If I listen to music, it’s through headphones and not on a speaker, just like I would at work. My desk faces a wall, with my back towards anything in my home.
I do my hair and face and get changed into work clothes, albeit with a more “casual Friday” approach. These steps allow me to fully focus on work, in work time, even if it’s from home.
I’ve done the same for my children. They have their own (very small) dedicated learning space, a packed lunchbox and drink bottle like they would for school, and a list of educational tasks and physical activities they have to complete before they can head back to their “home space” for some free time aka PlayStation games and Tik Tok.
Their tasks also help my working from home because without them, I’d be dealing with children wanting my attention.
As we face a new reality, it’s important we find what works for each of us to get us through these uncertain times. If you have a job you are juggling with home life, I’d say it’s something to be thankful for in our current economic climate. I’d say there are many who would prefer to be dealing with that “problem”.

EDITORIAL Travel hopes as Covid-19 recedes	The Northern Advocate	For those suffering pangs of wanderlust to travel beyond our shores, today offers hope.
Several European countries will take important first steps to reopen borders, after the initial wave of Covid-19. Jamaica and Aruba in the Caribbean are also loosening restrictions.
Most countries are initially focusing on their region.
Reopening borders will risk a rise in cases with countries experiencing varied outbreaks.
Kiwis are from this week invited to visit Greece. Although our case numbers are zero, other countries are still in the grip of the pandemic and yet, in some cases, their citizens will be able to travel abroad. Britons, for instance, are not yet able to travel to Greece but can visit Italy, Croatia and Switzerland.
From today, people from 29 countries including New Zealand and Australia can fly into Athens and Thessaloniki in Greece. It has been one of the most successful countries in Europe in combating the coronavirus, with 3112 cases and 183 deaths.
Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Croatia, Iceland, Poland, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, will now generally allow in visitors from EU and nearby non-member countries without quarantines. Some medical documentation or tests are required and people from Spain, Britain, and Sweden, which have had difficult outbreaks, are still banned from some countries.
Spain is waiting until July to lift most restrictions. Britain has only just introduced quarantines for arrivals and has suffered 41,747 deaths — the most in Europe.
The stiff global recession could still be a major drag on hopes for a tourism-led bounce in Europe’s warmer weather. In the eurozone, GDP is expected to fall by more than 9 per cent, even if a second wave of infections is avoided.
But after months of lockdowns there will be pent-up pressure for travel. The virus is more patient — worldwide it has infected 7.7 million people and caused 428,100 deaths.
“We need to be sure that a summer tourist season won’t come at the high price of a second wave of infections,” Germany Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said last month.
Brazil is now second to the US in confirmed cases — at 828,810, with 41,828 deaths. Also rising is India with 309,000 infections — now the fourth worst-affected country. Yesterday cases were up in 17 American states after weeks of governors reopening their economies.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

OUR VIEW Shop local to get your fast food fix	Wanganui Chronicle	For those who know me well, you know I enjoy feasting on a KFC quarter pack. At least I did, before I suddenly couldn’t.
I’ve gone completely cold-turkey — well cold-chicken — for the past month and a half because Covid-19 turned those friers off across the country.
While admittedly I only lost chicken, and I realise chicken isn’t the biggest loss to the world, even when it is coated with 11 perfectly blended herbs and spices, I still went through the six stages of grief.
Denial. I couldn’t believe the building had been closed. I thought they would come up with a work around and open up. But they didn’t. The more I hoped, the closer I got to the second stage.
Anger. As my cravings got worse, so did my moods. The loss of KFC had me thinking of all the ‘what ifs’. What if things were different, how would the meal taste? How could something I accessed so easily turn into something I can’t have at all?
Bargaining. My longing for potato and gravy and a piece of succulent chicken grew with each passing day. I found myself snacking on unhealthy foods just to try and satisfy my hunger.
Sadness. While getting my finger lickin’ good chicken fix, I would often bring my friends on a trip. We would sit at the beach and talk as we feasted. I began to grow sad that as well as being deprived of my chicken, I couldn’t spend time with my friends. Maybe it wasn’t just about the chicken after all.
Acceptance. Halfway through the third week, I began to accept that I would not be able to satisfy my cravings for quite some time so there was no point working up an appetite.
All jokes aside, it did take a while to get used to.
However, now I’ve entered the final stage, moving on. Part of this was realising I didn’t need to go out of town to get my fix, especially when there are so many options here in Stratford.
Stratford is home to many great food places and what better way to support my town then to put my money where my mouth is and shop local.
All the owners of our local businesses have their own mouths to feed so while I’m filling my own, I’ll help to feed them.
While I still can’t see my friends, by shopping local I’m supporting them, and that’s the next best thing.
Since the alert levels are lowered, I can guarantee I’ll be in line at Sahara (at a safe distance) to get my meat on chips. Or, I’ll be visiting the local takeaway shop for some fish ‘n’ chips. You can’t beat the classic after all.
While I say this, I can’t guarantee that I won’t be going to get a quarter pack ever again. My longing for the crispy coated chicken can’t be denied for ever.
However, my trips will be less regular and I’ll be spending my money here in Stratford.

No Virgin rebirth through long-suffering taxpayers	The Australian	Foreign carrier’s shareholders should provide fresh funds
The Morrison government is wisely knocking back ever more desperate pleas for a $1.4bn bailout of Virgin Australia. Highlighting the principles at stake, Josh Frydenberg declared the beleaguered airline’s shareholders needed to be the first port of call, not Australian taxpayers. “They’ve got deep pockets,” the Treasurer said on Thursday. “We want to see Virgin continue, we want to see two airlines in the domestic market, but we’re not in the business of owning an airline.” Those days are over; Qantas was privatised in 1993. Besides, as Mr Frydenberg noted, taxpayers have stumped up more than $1bn in relief for the aviation industry, with cuts to fuel taxes and other charges, as well as economy-wide measures such as the $1500 a fortnight JobKeeper wage subsidy to workers. The government is preparing to announce a network of subsidised domestic flights to be operated by the two major airlines, but the final details have been delayed as Virgin Australia pushes for a rescue.
Airlines have been among the worst affected companies by the coronavirus pandemic after governments imposed travel bans and severe restrictions on cross-border movements within Australia. Official figures show a 26 per cent plunge in international tourism arrivals in February, from a year earlier, as COVID-19 restrictions took hold, akin to the drop in visitors following the September 2001 terror attacks in the US. Given steeper falls are expected when March figures are released, it’s understandable the tourism industry wants a resolution to the troubled airline’s problems. For tourism to thrive, it needs two successful and competitive carriers. The Treasurer, an optimist in gloomy times, maintains talk of Virgin Australia’s collapse is “speculating about the future”, but the financial pressure is mounting.
Even before COVID-19, the airline was struggling, carrying $5bn in debt. A revamp by chief executive Paul Scurrah was in progress. But after two days in a trading halt, on Thursday Virgin Australia asked the ASX for a further suspension of up to seven days. In a statement to the exchange, the company said it was not in a position to make an announcement with respect to financial assistance and restructuring alternatives. It is in talks with insolvency and turnaround experts and debt restructuring specialists. But any restructuring would be reliant on a significant capital injection. Again, that must come from Virgin Australia’s shareholders, who are not hard up by any means. The carrier’s ownership is split between Etihad, Singapore Airlines, Chinese airline HNA and Chinese conglomerate Nanshan. Billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Group still has a 10 per cent stake, while 10 per cent of the airline’s shares are listed on our exchange.
Of course when the money taps of state are flowing like never before, it makes sense for companies to try every possible taxpayer spigot. After all, never let a crisis go to waste is the industry lobbyists’ credo. Much easier to scrounge a lazy loan or special deal than it is for a troubled company to cut costs, operate more efficiently, compete more effectively, inspire new investors, rationalise unprofitable routes, ditch flashy lounges and trim executive pay. Or simply take a leaf out of the Qantas playbook. In 2014, the national carrier was facing turbulence and it, too, chose the flight path of least resistance by asking Canberra for a debt guarantee or an unsecured loan. The Abbott government rebuffed Qantas. So, too, were Holden and SPC Ardmona on industry handouts. It was a mighty stand by Tony Abbott and treasurer Joe Hockey, perhaps their finest hour. In truth, the rejection did Qantas no harm. Chief executive Alan Joyce did whatever was necessary to repair, retool and revive the carrier. If Mr Joyce’s smaller foreign rival gets a leg up, he’ll take one three times the size!
An airline begging for money, even in straitened times, is not a good look. Sure, there may be a short-term political reason for a government to yield. Virgin Australia employs 9000 staff and carries 25 million passengers a year. Yet in the long run, like propping up failing vehicle producers or high-wage textile workers, it is a losing play. We are much better off as a nation putting our scarce capital and labour into areas where we have a competitive advantage. In any case, there’s nothing to stop a cashed-up emir, barnstorming billionaire, a rich city-state’s sovereign wealth fund or even a local superannuation giant from doubling down on their investments. And if they don’t, like all investors in tough times, they must take their financial medicine.We need two viable airlines, but not via this desperate route. The proposal for a government equity stake if the $1.4bn loan is not repaid within a few years may have surface appeal for some but it would require investors and creditors to make huge sacrifices. That’s unlikely. The best path is for the carrier to be put in administration this year, clearing the decks decisively, then restructuring the airline under new management. Perhaps a return to its low-cost, high-profit roots. That would entice fresh capital into a lucrative market. Bailouts come with moral hazards and delay the day of reckoning. Imagine the queue of chief executives for industry support if this deal were done. All this speculation, and Labor’s Pollyanna idea of equity support for the carrier, is counter-productive, crowding out any potential market-led solution. Scott Morrison should hold firm and not be this ineptly managed airline’s “white knight”. As we have argued during this crisis, the COVID-19 recovery game plan must be to preserve our private enterprises, not to entrench big, heavy-handed government at the heart of the Australian economy.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Stick to the rules and play the long game on China	The Australian	Foreign relations bill coincides with a new flurry of trade sanctions
It should be no surprise that the passing of Australia’s foreign relations bill through parliament on Tuesday has been followed by fresh trade sanctions from China. Immediately after the bill passed, with Labor withdrawing its proposed amendments, China slapped new import restrictions on meat exports from Queensland-based abattoir Meramist. Beijing also has banned timber from two more states and spread trade disruption to Australia’s $780m lamb export industry.
As we report on Thursday, concerns are mounting that restrictions on imports of Australian cotton and wheat could be next. When the foreign relations bill was first mooted, China signalled its displeasure by banning exports from family-owned meat processor John Dee in August. There is now a long list of Australian producers caught up in a potent mix of Chinese domestic politics that requires President Xi Jinping’s vision of his nation’s powers to be exported, respected and obeyed. Although the foreign relations bill does not mention China, it was sparked by concerns about the Victorian government’s decision to engage with Beijing on the Belt and Road Initiative. The bill also will allow the federal government to oversee agreements between Australian universities and China.
As trade tensions have escalated, China through its diplomats has chosen to take the low road with fake tweets disparaging of Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. The evidence is this overt behaviour might have played well to a domestic audience in China but it has galvanised sentiment against the Chinese Communist Party leadership abroad. In the face of the tweet, the federal opposition was forced to drop its proposed amendments to the foreign relations legislation to include a register of decisions and judicial review.
In contrast to China’s histrionics, Australia has maintained a principled stance, lodging its grievances with the World Trade Organisation and continuing to stand firm in the face of escalating provocations by its major trading partner. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham has accused Beijing of undermining the “letter and spirit” of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and its obligations under WTO rules. He said China’s imposition of “disruptive and restrictive measures” on a wide range of Australian goods and services in recent months was in violation of the 2015 agreement. In a letter to the Senate, Senator Birmingham said China was ignoring measures under ChAFTA requiring regular meetings and review. Lack of engagement by China in recent years had prevented the use of WTO structures.
At a November 25 WTO meeting, Australia raised China’s treatment of Australian barley, wine, meat, lobsters, logs, coal and cotton, and said it was “considering all dispute settlement options”. China is unlikely to be overly concerned about any actions taken by Australia via the WTO. The trade hostilities have merely confirmed what critics have long argued — that China does not respect international trade norms or value rules-based systems in general.
The immediate lesson for Australia is to take a leaf from the book of its errant trading partner and continue to play the long game. While the impact of the immediate trade bans may be difficult for those caught up in restrictions, from a national perspective trade figures between Australia and China continue to be in rude health overall. This is because of booming prices for the commodity China needs most from Australia, iron ore. There is further evidence that punitive measures taken against Australian coal exports have resulted in sharp price increases for China as it seeks product from other markets. Official figures released by China on Monday revealed Australia’s exports to China in the first 11 months of the year were $142bn, down 4 per cent on the corresponding period in the previous year, despite the pandemic.
There are forces within China’s political elite that are more reform-minded than Mr Xi. It is reasonable to expect that relations between Australia and China eventually will return to a more even keel. In the meantime, as Rowan Callick wrote on Saturday, we are living through the implementation of Mr Xi’s new doctrine of Thoughts on Socialism With Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. Callick says this is an era in which China’s rulers feel that it now has enough economic heft, enough military might, enough ultra-modern infrastructure and enough robust institutions — all directed by the party with its clear line of command — to go it alone. Australia is not the only country experiencing trade coercion from China as it seeks to demonstrate its new power for the benefit of a domestic and regional audience. As Callick wrote, in Mr Xi’s new order, China wants to be surrounded by “tribute states” that defer to it as the paramount power and that in return are offered its shield of security and economic opportunity. Australia’s refusal to play ball is proving irritating for China’s current leadership but it should have been expected from a nation that values freedom and puts issues of sovereignty over mercantile pursuits. China’s bigger trade dispute with the US no doubt will occupy more of Beijing’s thinking soon. Australia is best served sticking to the rules-based order, maintaining links with moderate political forces in Beijing and reminding China’s people that there is no dispute with them.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Pope cold on market economy	The Australian	Francis wants the UN to have more power to rein in nations With Australia’s debt ceiling lifted beyond $1.1 trillion, Josh Frydenberg no doubt will be looking for all the wisdom and good advice he can find ahead of handing down the deficit-heavy federal budget on Tuesday. Given the strict separation between church and state enjoyed in Australia, a 43,000-word encyclical offered by Pope Francis, thankfully, can be used for spiritual guidance rather than as a template for the nation’s economic reform.
There is much to admire in Pope Francis’s latest offering, Fratelli Tutti (Brothers All), even if the title offended some for its perceived lack of inclusion and overt sense of papal patriarchy. Respecting universal human rights regardless of a person’s place or status is a bedrock of compassionate humanity. But on economics and the future role of global institutions such as the UN, the lessons drawn by the Pope from the COVID-19 pandemic might hinder rather than assist Australia in meeting its economic challenge.
The encyclical is highly political. Pope Francis’s major targets include what he calls the dogma of neoliberal economics and its promises of trickle-down prosperity. The global financial crisis and subprime collapse in the US indeed have shown that a laissez-faire approach can have unintended and unwelcome consequences. But hankering for a new world economic and political order, as set out by Pope Francis, can be a dangerous thing with unintended results of its own.
The Pope calls for strengthening the UN and other multilateral structures to rein in a globalised economy beyond the power of nation states to regulate. COVID-19, he argues, has exposed false securities and, despite the new hyper-connectivity, has highlighted fragmentation that makes it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all. Anyone who thinks the only lesson to be learned is the need to improve what we are already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality, he says.
The Pope’s response is to embellish existing Catholic teaching that says the right to private property is subordinate to the “universal destination of created goods”, something Pope Francis says extends beyond national borders. In his view, each country also belongs to the foreigner, in as much as a territory’s goods must not be denied to a needy person coming from elsewhere.
For Australia, one lesson from the pandemic has been its over-reliance on others for essential products and medical supplies. Greater self-reliance, as has been articulated already by the federal government, is perhaps a better remedy than a church-inspired global command and control over goods and services as envisaged in Fratelli Tutti. Shopkeepers also may be hoping that consumers ignore the papal advice not to “plunge even more deeply into feverish consumerism and new forms of egoistic self-preservation” as they prepare to celebrate Christmas.
For Fratelli Tutti, Pope Francis uses the biblical story of the good Samaritan to help make his bigger point. He also wants the issues debated, urging readers: “Let us arm our children with the weapons of dialogue! Let us teach them to fight the good fight of the culture of encounter!” But if there is a time-honoured wisdom to be pondered by the Australian Treasurer as he puts the final touches to the budget, it is perhaps one that does not come from the Bible. Rather, it is the proverb raised by The Australian’s cartoonist Johannes Leak that teaching someone to fish will always be better than welfare, wherever it comes from.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Containing ‘spot fires’ vital to living with COVID-19	The Australian	Fresh strategies are needed if lockdowns are to be avoided
We need a better way. And potentially useful signposts towards it emerged on Sunday, at the same time as the US broke records for new coronavirus infections, Victoria’s caseload spiked by 273 and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian feared southwest Sydney could “ go down the path of Victoria”.
The Australian, for good reason, has consistently favoured suppression of COVID-19 in preference to the devastating economic effects of “elimination’’ and the widespread, deadly consequences of Swedish-style “herd immunity’’. Business leaders have now turned attention to how Australians can live with the virus while continuing to suppress it and regrow the economy. Writing on Monday, Graham Turner, founder and managing director of the Flight Centre Travel Group, whose sector has been hardest hit by the pandemic, says all sectors, but particularly travel, tourism and hospitality, urgently need to know governments’ objectives for COVID-19 control and the strategies that will be used to achieve them. By enunciating the way ahead, governments would allow businesses to plan how best to survive the near-term challenges.
Despite our best efforts, periodic pop-ups of COVID-19 will continue but we “can’t keep taking a sledgehammer to our economy time and time again and expect businesses to survive, consumer confidence to remain above the waterline and jobs to be retained and created’’, Innes Willox, chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, points out. Taxpayers are supporting about 3.3 million people on JobKeeper and 1.4 million on JobSeeker. That situation, says Business Council chief executive Jennifer Westacott, necessitates the creation of about two million new jobs in two years. That is about the number created over the past decade, at a time of sustained growth and China’s economic expansion. Policy settings that encourage business investment and infrastructure stimulus will be essential, as will a more competitive business tax rate within a few years. And, as Mr Willox notes, more than a third of apprentices could be out of training in months, creating a serious skills shortage when the economy rebounds. In view of Victoria’s predicament, which is costing at least $1bn a week, it is essential to avoid what Scott Morrison warned against in June: “We can’t go, stop, go, stop, go. We can’t flick the light on and off, and on and off, and on and off.” In an interview with Helen Trinca on Monday, US theoretical physicist and cosmologist Paul Davies, stranded in Sydney by the pandemic, sums up the challenge when he says living with COVID-19 is about putting out “spot fires” when they occur. Hopes are high for an effective and safe vaccine, possibly from the University of Queensland. But, as Professor Davies says, we may have to live with the virus forever. Learning to live with it, while containing the number of people needing intensive care, is the most sensible option, as Mr Turner says. But what worries business is “panic at clusters of infection and subsequent ham-fisted shutdowns or lockdowns, as we have seen in Victoria’’. The economic outcomes of lockdowns, he says, have been dire and are likely to become far worse, affecting the lives of millions of mainly young Australians with children and a mortgage. Mr Turner wants COVID-19 contained to “certain small areas or zones’’ while reopening domestic and international borders as soon as possible. Doing so “will be vital for the survival of many businesses, and not just in travel’’.
Professor Davies, too, spoke about isolating people in small hotspots and modifying vulnerable points in the pandemic network, such as transport and flight hubs. As Mr Willox says, what we need are more flexible, nuanced and localised approaches to deal with the virus that take account of employment hardship and the growing impact of the crisis on mental health.
After a series of inexcusable errors, and the complacency that arose after the Andrews government sent the wrong message about the Black Lives Matter protests five weeks ago, Victoria’s problems are now far beyond “hotspots’’. Many cases remain clustered in public housing towers and Melbourne’s outer west. But the virus has spread to Geelong, Greater Bendigo, the alpine shire of Baw Baw, Greater Shepparton, the coast and Swan Hill on the Murray. Other states must avoid similar mistakes.
In southwest Sydney, authorities need to track, trace and test hundreds of people who visited the Crossroads Hotel in Casula now that officials have confirmed the venue’s cluster has grown to four. Ms Berejiklian has appealed to people who visited the hotel from July 3 to July 10 to stay home for 14 days and self-isolate. Officials should back that appeal with spot checks once those at risk are identified. It could be the difference between a local cluster and devastating outbreak in our most populous state. Business leaders are not epidemiologists or experts on public health. But they understand the impact of recession on the wellbeing of young people, families with mortgages, older workers finding themselves out of work too soon and business owners losing their enterprises and savings. Avoiding a repetition of the calamity besetting Melbourne should be an important goal of the nation’s suppression strategy. If another major city lockdown, from which many businesses and households will not recover, is to be avoided, the principles set out by business leaders are worth examining. And, as Mr Turner says, governments must make their objectives and strategies clear.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
EDITORIAL Time for level heads over move to level 1	The Northern Advocate	From midday today, the Government’s Covid-19 alert level 2 rules around social gatherings will be relaxed, meaning groups of up to 100 people are permitted — albeit still with social-distancing requirements.
This will have a profound effect for many individuals and organisations who felt short-changed by the stringent social-distancing measures of the past weeks, and upset and confused by the disparities.
Notably, churches will be able to hold services with more of their congregations, family and friends will be able to gather in larger numbers — including for events like tangi/funerals and weddings.
Although large concerts are still out, planners will certainly look forward to being able to cater to some events, and it will enable easier operations for the likes of community sport organisations.
It is certainly another step in the right direction towards normalising our lives, and has only been possible thanks to the public’s adherence to the strict measures under levels 3 and 4, and the efforts of a range of officials and workers, which have kept the virus tracked and contained and seemingly well on the way to being eliminated.
More than two months after the country went into full lockdown, the prospect of another month of any restrictions may seem unbearable to some and frustrating for many — particularly as our active case numbers are rapidly reducing.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said Cabinet will review the alert level 2 settings on June 8, and “no later than June 22” it will consider a move to level 1. It is clear there is official disagreement, however, most vocally from NZ First leader and Deputy PM Winston Peters, who thinks we should be in level 1 — and a transtasman travel bubble without quarantine — now.
Yet, after coming this far, it is clear the Labour-led Government is not going to throw caution to the wind and is confident it is leading the way in opening up the economy and easing social gathering settings.
The health advice is that the picture only becomes clearer after each two-week incubation period, and only after a full month can we have the greatest reassurance there is no re-emergence of Covid-19. So, until at least June 22, we need to play by level 2 rules.
Use the next month wisely, embrace the larger gatherings offered, but remember to continue supporting local businesses wherever possible, as it will be make-or-break time for many.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

PM’s reshuffle a chance to re-grasp political initiative	The Australian	Frontbenchers must do more to advance the government’s agenda Scott Morrison’s cabinet reshuffle, more extensive than pundits predicted, will be the circuit-breaker the government needs only if the main players, male and female, take the opportunity it affords to step up, take control of the political agenda and better assert the government’s message. The Prime Minister sounded back on form on Monday after a “very traumatic” (his words) few weeks. His ministerial changes and a new cabinet taskforce to focus on women’s equality and safety put the interests of women front and centre of government and are a brave attempt to show he “gets it”.
A year at most from the next federal campaign, the public performance of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Women Marise Payne, who will co-chair the cabinet taskforce with Mr Morrison, will be critical. Senator Payne’s reticence as controversies raged over Brittany Higgins and Christian Porter let down the government and the public. Her failure to appear at the recent Women’s March 4 Justice was incomprehensible. Working behind the scenes as a leading moderate within the Liberal Party was no substitute for public engagement. Senator Payne showed again on Monday that when she asserts herself she is articulate and balanced. The new role entrusted to her — Mr Morrison said she would be “effectively the prime minister for women” — will amount to little if she does not step up and grasp the agenda. So must Social Services Minister Anne Ruston, who has been given responsibility for women’s security, and Superannuation Minister Jane Hume, whose role now will include women’s economic security. Between them, they need to match Labor warriors such as Tanya Plibersek and Penny Wong. Senator Payne will be helped by the feisty, capable Amanda Stoker as assistant minister.
Too often Coalition frontbenchers, male and female, have seemed as hapless as deer caught in headlights as Mr Morrison has battled and stumbled through the recent storms, often alone. On Monday, the comments of Health Minister Greg Hunt and Senator Ruston on the future of lamentable LNP backbencher Andrew Laming were welcome. Matters of direct importance to women are part of every portfolio. But Mr Hunt, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack, government Senate leader Simon Birmingham and many others have been too aloof from recent controversies. Former ministers Julie Bishop and Kelly O’Dwyer would not have been so passive. Neither has the government been well served by its advisers. It needs experienced hardheads of the calibre of Grahame Morris, Arthur Sinodinos and Brian Loughnane. To some extent the pattern was entrenched when Mr Morrison won the 2019 election virtually alone. Josh Frydenberg is a highly effective, high-profile, hardworking Treasurer. Mathias Cormann was a big loss. Mr Hunt and Peter Dutton are very competent, but few others have shone. It is time for a stronger team performance, including by staff. Looking ahead, the talent pool of MPs elected in 2019, such as Katie Allen and Celia Hammond, appears promising.
The latest Newspoll, predictably, shows recent controversies have taken some gloss off Mr Morrison’s strong approval rating. But his lead as preferred prime minister over Anthony Albanese remains solid. The crisis should not be as catastrophic for the government as its enemies wish. Mainstream voters do not expect Mr Morrison and his team to change human behaviour across the nation. Nor is Labor immune from the problems under the spotlight. But voters want the government to demonstrate it is addressing the key issues in so far as the parameters of government allow, and setting problems in its own ranks and in Parliament House to rights. The reshuffle is a good base for a reboot.
When defence is increasingly important, Mr Dutton has the gravitas, experience and strength to be Defence Minister and leader of government business in the house. Karen Andrews, who has driven the Coalition’s agenda on advanced manufacturing, deserves the larger challenge of home affairs. While Christian Porter’s position as attorney-general was untenable, demoting him, while remaining in cabinet, was wrong. In effect, he has lost his job and seniority in government due to an unfair and unjust personal campaign waged against him by the ABC and seized upon by Labor. It leaves Michaelia Cash a major challenge as Attorney-General and Industrial Relations Minister. Linda Reynolds should have done the decent thing and stepped back from the ministry. She can consider herself fortunate to remain in cabinet. She is a beneficiary of Mr Morrison’s reluctance to demote ministerial colleagues. Addressing issues such as women’s safety and discrimination is important, and there is no doubt a mood in the community for social change in the treatment of women. But the Coalition must not allow itself to be dragged too far or too often onto the left’s turf. The government’s priorities, creating the economic settings for prosperity and jobs, and managing COVID, are of prime importance to men and women and their families. Mr Morrison and Senator Payne spoke about examining policy through a new lens. While redressing problems highlighted recently, the government must focus primarily on its economic strengths. These matter most to mainstream voters.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
WHO panel must look at every aspect of COVID-19	The Australian	Full access to Wuhan lab will help Helen Clark get to truth
Former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark is right to regard her appointment as co-head of the World Health Organisation’s independent panel investigating the COVID-19 pandemic as “exceptionally challenging”. After seven years leading the UN Development Program and three terms as prime minister, Ms Clark has extensive experience of the wiles and, all too often, the cover-ups, corruption, wilful obfuscation and doublespeak of governments and global bureaucracies. Known as a tough political fighter, she will need to call on all those reserves if she and panel co-head Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace prize winner and former Liberian president, are to come close to fulfilling the fully justified demand initiated by Scott Morrison in March for a complete, transparent and independent probe. At the World Health Assembly in May the push for an inquiry won unanimous support — even, grudgingly, from a cornered China.
The significance of the inquiry and expectations attached to it cannot be overstated. At stake is the fundamental credibility of the WHO as the US has withdrawn from the world body, taking its substantial funding with it. So, too, is the credibility of the WHO’s controversial Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, as well as that of China and its claims that, despite all that has happened, it is a responsible, law-abiding member of the international community that did all it could to stop the virus spreading. Amid the global devastation resulting from what emerged from Wuhan, the world wants answers. The panel led by Ms Clark and Ms Sirleaf must be unrelenting in getting them, however difficult it may prove to be trying to extract the truth from Dr Tedros, with his remarkably close links to Beijing, or China’s combative dictatorship.
The surge in cases across the globe, as the total number of infections soars past 13 million, with close to 600,000 deaths so far, underlines the urgency of the need for the panel to find out exactly what happened after the virus appeared in Wuhan and why it was able to spread like wildfire. Rightly, in Australia, we’re concerned about the current surge in Victoria. But our numbers remain thankfully small and need to be seen in perspective, with the US’s almost 3.5 million cases and 140,000 deaths so far, Brazil’s almost two million cases and 73,000 deaths, and India’s almost 900,000 cases and 24,000 deaths reflecting the unrelenting upward curve of the viral scourge and the continuing plight of much of the world.
Ms Clark has been wise at the outset to express wholehearted support for the Prime Minister’s initiative in calling for the investigation. That may not be what Beijing, in trying to dissemble and fend off any blame, wants to hear. But so be it. Without being pollyannish, Ms Clark was right to have said on Saturday that the aim of her panel must be “to stop the world from being blindsided again by a crisis like this”. Overwhelmingly, the challenge for her will be to overcome Beijing’s intransigence and persuade it that it is as much in China’s own best interests to get a clear-eyed, independent picture of the virus’s trajectory as it is in the interests of the rest of the world. Beijing’s irrational, dog-in-the-manger response to Mr Morrison’s initial perfectly reasonable demand for the investigation makes even less sense now, in the light of events, than it did in March. If President Xi Jinping wants to see his country returned to any sort of respectability on the global stage, he must ensure that Ms Clark’s panel is given full and unfettered access to all aspects of the virus’s provenance, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If the panel is to fulfil the WHA’s unanimous endorsement of the need for an independent inquiry, Dr Tedros must not be allowed to run interference over what the panel does and where it goes. The probe itself would have little credibility if it failed to put Wuhan firmly in the frame as the site of the pandemic’s origins in the city’s wet markets as well as claims about the Virology Institute. The panel’s investigation is an acid test for the WHO and China. Both have a last chance to ensure the world gets to know the truth about the devastating pandemic’s origins. Ms Clark has a pivotal role in ensuring that happens.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
High risk of ‘whatever it takes’	The Australian	Generation Debt is being burdened with vast budget deficits
By Tuesday afternoon almost 280,000 businesses had registered an interest in the new $1500-a-fortnight JobKeeper payment. The $130bn wage subsidy scheme is the Morrison government’s third fiscal rescue effort in 18 days, after a $17.6bn first strike and $66.1bn follow-up. That’s almost $214bn in fresh funds from Canberra, or 11 per cent of gross domestic product, to keep businesses running and workers in jobs. Add in $105bn in low-cost loans from the Reserve Bank and other agencies, and Australia’s mammoth fiscal response to fighting COVID-19 has been “whatever it takes”. The “unprecedented level of support reflects the unprecedented moment”, says Josh Frydenberg. JobKeeper won’t be the last fiscal move but is likely to be the showstopper. Scott Morrison said the government would continue to do “all within our power and all within our capacity” to keep the engine of the economy running.
On Tuesday, the Treasurer struck a sober note after the binge, conceding it would take “years and years” just to pay off the new scheme, which is designed to run for six months. It’s possible some earlier emergency measures, such as the overly optimistic expansion of the instant asset write-off, may not cost as much as thought, given the horrendous short-run outlook for capital spending. But the budget, essentially in balance before the coronavirus outbreak, is sliding into a morass. Normally in a downturn, tax from companies and workers falls while welfare spending rises; the budget deficit increases. This crisis is a different proposition as public spending expands at an astonishing rate to cushion the blow from an economy in an induced coma because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The flow of deficits to come, the biggest since World War II, will add to our existing stock of debt, which requires servicing.
This vast public spending will push state and federal government debt towards $1.5 trillion by next year, or 80 per cent of GDP, reports economics editor Adam Creighton, the highest level since the early 1950s. A slump as large as the Depression looms, presaging a “generation of debt”. Canberra’s deficit could balloon by $300bn across this and next financial year. While long-range forecasting is fraught, analysts argue it could take 30 years to get back to surplus. Compared with others, we are far from being a public debt basket case, although very high levels of mortgage, vehicle and consumer debt burden households.
Credit rating agencies are sanguine about our medium-term prospects. That can quickly change. The key fiscal challenge is not to laminate into the budget these emergency responses. We take the Prime Minister at his word when he says the measures are temporary and targeted. It will take courage to turn off the money tap, especially when so many workers still will be unemployed when we cross the bridge to what looks like a recovery. It’s unlikely that we’ll spring out of the chasm when so much of our economy is based on exports. Tourism, education, fisheries and agriculture depend on the economic strength of middle classes in Asia, Europe and the US, where COVID-19 is wreaking its heaviest tolls.Debt overhang will be a significant burden for policymakers and taxpayers. It could be made more precarious if Canberra has no option but to bail out strategic industries, such as the airlines, with debt or equity deals. We applaud the intent and speed of the economic rescue efforts, but the costume change into big government must not become a permanent look. Those aged under 50, who’ve never known a recession, let alone a depression, will be vested with the recovery and its bill. Young people now learning from home should not be doomed to being “Generation Debt”. “Policies that were thought fair and reasonable only months ago will start to look unfair, even absurd,” Creighton wrote on Tuesday of the clawback of state largesse required. Governments will face blunt choices about how to allocate the burden, while not killing off with punitive taxes the most productive parts and players in our economy.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
EDITORIAL Voters need facts and clarity	Wanganui Chronicle	German Chancellor Angela Merkel knows a lot about leadership, having run the European Union powerhouse for 15 years.
Germany has benefited from her cautious, steady hand on the tiller during the pandemic.
Other countries have not been so fortunate, and Merkel last week pointedly called out some other leaders’ shortcomings.
“As we are experiencing first-hand, you cannot fight the pandemic with lies and disinformation any more than you can fight it with hate or incitement to hatred,” Merkel told the European Parliament.
“The limits of populism and denial of basic truths are being laid bare. In a democracy, facts and transparency are needed.”
The top two countries for Covid-19 infections are the United States and Brazil, with four million cases between them. Their populist leaders have consistently downplayed the danger of the coronavirus, spread disinformation, and ignored realities on the ground to reopen economies. But spin is useless in a pandemic. Health facts cannot be argued with.
As our September election nears, Merkel’s words are a reminder that leaders’ characters and methods matter, because voters find out the hard way in crises if there are major deficiencies.
Covid-19 has tested leaders on whether their basic goal is to do the right thing. The best leaders manage to be themselves while being strategically smart. They can make big calls and take sensible steps. They show at least some ability to anticipate and avoid political pitfalls.
Leaders who are basically competent and well-meaning can still appoint the wrong people, not think through the implications of decisions, get bad advice and be indecisive. Sometimes experiencing major difficulties can build knowledge and confidence for future challenges.
Our Government tried to staunch the bad news on testing and quarantines, changing frontline personnel dealing with the brief. Four cases of returnees escaping from managed isolation have stirred new outrage, although they represent a tiny fraction of the thousands of people who have passed through.
There is still no evidence of community transmission but we are not alone in having these challenges. Two people were fined after fleeing Sydney hotel quarantine in the past week.
Yet, the risks are not trivial.
Victoria’s new outbreak is a major wake-up call.
National has also gone through upheaval with a scandal involving private Covid-19 patient details. It is not a good look for the party’s new leader, who is still establishing his bona fides.

EDITORIAL Voters need facts and clarifty	The Northern Advocate	German Chancellor Angela Merkel knows a lot about leadership, having run the European Union powerhouse for 15 years.
Germany has benefited from her cautious, steady hand on the tiller during the pandemic.
Other countries have not been so fortunate, and Merkel last week pointedly called out some other leaders’ shortcomings. She did not name names, but did not need to.
“As we are experiencing first-hand, you cannot fight the pandemic with lies and disinformation any more than you can fight it with hate or incitement to hatred,” Merkel told the European Parliament.
“The limits of populism and denial of basic truths are being laid bare. In a democracy, facts and transparency are needed.”
It is no accident that the top two countries for Covid-19 infections are the United States and Brazil, with four million cases between them.
Their populist leaders have consistently downplayed the danger of the coronavirus, spread disinformation, and ignored realities on the ground to reopen economies. But spin is useless. Health facts cannot be argued with.

Try something new Coromandel EDITORIAL	Bay of Plenty Times	Get out and explore our country
I’m liking the 100 per cent Pure New Zealand campaign ‘do something new, New Zealand’.
They’re reminding us: Now’s the time to get out and explore our incredible country, and do something new, New Zealand.
This week I tried out my first ever “spin” class.
I found myself in a dark room with nine other stationary bikes being peddled by other gym-goers, loud music and a very motivating instructor at Tairua’s new gym overlooking the Pauanui and Tairua harbour. It’s an incredible location and facility in a town that has very few. It was great!
In a stop-start year where those with business start-ups and events are not just adaptable, they’re malleable; (adjective) of a metal or other material able to be pressed into shape without breaking or cracking — I think we should join up and give our support whenever we can.
This week’s Coastal News Waihi Leader features a story on the boat show at the same location as Tairua’s new gym. Its organiser pulled it together in eight weeks and has become the hero of the marine industry for doing so.
In spite of all the setbacks, we’ve got drama (the theatrical kind) at the Boyd Rd Theatre in Waihi, and an upcoming Whangamata Arts Collective Spring Mingle — which was the Midwinter Mingle, and before that was supposed to have been the Easter Open Arts Studio Tour.
So let’s get out and do something new on the Coromandel, Coromandel, and appreciate the effort and positive attitude that these resilient locals have shown.

Wishing Victoria swift recovery	The Australian	Getting policy right is what counts now, not recriminations
After long weeks in severe lockdown, Victorians are overdue for hopeful news. The strain for many has been immense: socially, economically and psychologically. So it’s reassuring that on Monday the 14-day daily average of new infections edged down again to 34.4 from 36.2 on Sunday. The trend is in the right direction; on September 1, that daily average figure was 129. Victoria is well positioned for a resumption of outdoor socialising on a modest scale, signalling a morale-boosting step on the path back to something like normal life. That is what everyone wants, not just Victorians, and Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth spoke for us all when he welcomed the low infection result on Monday as “great news”.
Tuesday’s Newspoll shows that support for Premier Daniel Andrews is holding up better than may have been expected given the quarantine incompetence that led to the outbreak and the ensuing lockdown that a sizeable minority of Victorians regard as a ham-fisted and oppressive overreach. At 62 per cent Mr Andrews’s satisfaction level in the latest poll is an improvement on mid-July (57 per cent) but well down from a peak of 75 per cent in April. However, Victorians simultaneously rate Scott Morrison’s handling of the pandemic as superior to that of their own Premier. Perhaps the best interpretation of Mr Andrews’s pretty solid level of support is that enough Victorians take a pragmatic view. Right now, their immediate focus is on getting back to normality, not venting their anger at the government that put them back into lockdown. Like it or not, the Premier calls the shots and has been near immovable on lockdown, although with news of low infection numbers he has left open the possibility of an accelerated return to normality.
For someone constantly talking Victorians through the twists and turns of pandemic, Mr Andrews has not been plain and direct about responsibility for his administration’s costly blunders. In the quarantine inquiry on Monday the secretary of Mr Andrews’s own department, Chris Eccles, said he did not know who had made the fateful decision to use private security (some staff were trained in diversity but not infection control) in hotel quarantine while the state refused offers of help from the Australian Defence Force. The inquiry also heard that at the end of June Mr Andrews and key ministers knew that failures in infection control had led to outbreaks of COVID-19 in these hotels. It shouldn’t have taken this long to clarify exactly how these mistakes were made, but public pressure ultimately will demand a full account — and a political reckoning. Right now, however, the important thing is that while Mr Andrews maintains the appearance of rock-solid self-confidence, he clearly has begun to pay more heed to sceptical, informed voices, such as those of University of Melbourne dean of medicine Shitij Kapur and mathematical biologist James McCaw, who pointed out in these pages 10 days ago that the results of modelling are one element in shaping policy, not an edict to shut down debate. In the same way, there now seems a bit more room in Victoria’s political climate for nuance. It is not a simple moral choice between lives and money. Severe lockdown imposes personal and social costs, as well as financial damage, which have profound effects on human lives and also will result in premature death.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease

Manufacturing strategy to help business-led recovery	The Australian	Getting the economic settings right is the key to jobs
Scott Morrison has provided a worthwhile plan to Australia’s beleaguered business community reeling in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The $1.5bn package to rebuild manufacturing bears the hallmarks of the Prime Minister’s approach to policy. Pragmatism trumps purity. It is a strategy Sir Robert Menzies would have been comfortable with in the post-war years. It is also suitable for these times, after the virus has wreaked havoc on an economy and society that had become accustomed to virtually uninterrupted growth and prosperity for more than a generation. Any aspiration to deliver a budget surplus has long been abandoned. But there is no alternative if the nation is to emerge from this catastrophe with its social fabric and economy intact. After the commonwealth’s injection of massive stimulus into the economy, now is the time to shift gears.
As Mr Morrison made clear at the National Press Club on Thursday, this is not a nostalgic return to the protected, highly regulated Australian economy of the past that manufactured Holden cars, textiles, clothing and footwear. While not picking winners, the plan exercises discernment in supporting particular industries that are crucial to our supply chain in an increasingly polarised global order or that will leverage Australia’s comparative advantages and expertise. They have been well chosen: resources technology and critical minerals processing; food and beverage manufacturing; medical products; clean energy and recycling; defence industries; and the space industry.
In essence, the package is about supporting manufacturing by getting the fundamental economic settings right to foster productivity. The priorities need to be affordable and reliable energy, lower taxes, industrial relations reform, training and skills development, cutting red tape and infrastructure investment. Too often in the past, as Mr Morrison says, industry policy has ignored foundational elements in the vain hope that isolated programs and subsidies could make up for the broader deficiencies.
This pandemic has killed the faux utopia of Davos and returned the world to the brutal realism of Westphalian states engaging in trade with allies whose strategic interests mirror their own. The vulnerability of Australia’s supply chain, especially in the production and distribution of crucial medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, appears to have made an indelible impression on Mr Morrison, who has focused on sovereign autonomy in “areas of national interest”. His willingness to engage directly with business leaders to examine which areas can match public investment with their own capital is sensible. Too often in recent months, business has been ignored by state governments as arbitrary emergency measures have forced closures or imposed crippling limits on customers and trade. The emphasis on research and development and the acquisition of new skills among our workforce are vital. With the defective business model of many universities exposed by the absence of foreign students, new opportunities in the workforce may encourage young Australians to venture into areas that do not require second-rate degrees at exorbitant fees.
Mr Morrison, correctly, has linked economic recovery to Australia’s abundant natural energy resources. Gas accounts for up to 40 per cent of many industries’ cost structures in manufacturing. Combined with higher electricity costs, he said on Thursday, many firms were living “turnaround to turnaround’’, making existential decisions rather than decisions they’d prefer to be making about technology and productivity improvements to remain competitive. As Mr Morrison said: “This needs to change.” Neither could the nation afford “business as usual” in industrial relations as the Maritime Union of Australia dispute at Port Botany had demonstrated.
The June quarter contraction of 7 per cent hit Australia hard, but we are better placed than much of the world. In the same quarter, Britain suffered a 20 per cent contraction, with falls of more than 10 per cent in Canada, New Zealand, Italy and France. Our effective unemployment rate has fallen from 14.9 per cent at the height of the crisis to 9.3 per cent. It is to Australians’ advantage that corporate leaders such as the Business Council of Australia are on side with the government’s aim of a business-led recovery. On Thursday, BHP announced an $800m package to fund 3500 new apprenticeships and trainees. Earlier in the COVID crisis, Mr Morrison noted that Australians could not hide under the bedcovers indefinitely. We’re now up and running. Good health policy at federal and state level, however, remains vital to avoiding a second wave of coronavirus or a third wave in Victoria. Australia, as Mr Morrison says, is one of very few nations — along with Norway, Taiwan, South Korea and Finland — that has succeeded in combining the dual health and economic objectives. But Australia is in the same global economy and environment as everyone else. Last week’s surge in new cases in Europe to higher levels than those of the first wave is forcing new restrictions. A repeat of that situation here would derail recovery, regardless of industry and economic policy.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Political capital squandered	The Australian	Gladys Berejiklian has been badly caught out on COVID test Gladys Berejiklian’s “head prefect of NSW” persona has served the Premier well. Conscientious to the point of being a workaholic, as she was as head girl of her public secondary school in North Ryde more than 30 years ago, Ms Berejiklian, 50, retains a schoolgirl demeanour. She bops about, even in parliament, and nods and giggles. Her expressive face shows how much she dislikes criticism. Even on Tuesday last week, when she should have been self-isolating after a COVID-19 test, she touched a colleague on the arm as she swanned into the Legislative Assembly chamber to vote. Being nerdish, a bit quaint but competent economically and in getting on top of the coronavirus after the Ruby Princess debacle has strengthened Ms Berejiklian’s position. Among premiers, she has been the voice of reason and decency about opening state borders.
Few other politicians would have survived the revelations of her secret relationship with disgraced former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire. Imagine if Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews were in the same boat. Ms Berejiklian’s poor romantic choice garnered sympathy and empathy as much as incredulity and dismay. Then came the scandal of her senior policy adviser, Sarah Lau, shredding and deleting notes about the allocation of $250m worth of grants under the Stronger Communities Fund before last year’s state election. Claims of pork barrelling tarnished Ms Berejiklian’s image some more, but not irretrievably.
What has really made her frontbench colleagues look askance is a more blatant and clear-cut lapse of judgment and ethics. Voters, or her partyroom, ultimately will decide whether it was acceptable for her office to tell what amounts to a big lie on her behalf and then try to cover it up with threats when she was sprung by The Australian’s Yoni Bashan. Voters — or the partyroom — also will decide what it reveals about Ms Berejiklian’s character and integrity. She’s seen as a stickler for rules and correct process — she makes her displeasure clear when colleagues fail to social distance — but her willingness to bend the rules herself when she thinks no one is looking is now clear. That includes the COVID-19 rules that have kept NSW safe and its economy open. She also has broken a cynical political rule: “Don’t get caught.” When political personas are pricked and found to be froth and bubble, they are usually in deep trouble.
After pursuing a lead for six days amid stonewalling from the Premier’s office, Bashan scooped the Macquarie Street press pack on Monday. He reported that Ms Berejiklian attended parliament last week while waiting for COVID-19 test results. It was a breach of health guidelines that require NSW residents to self-isolate until they are cleared. Ms Berejiklian’s office scrambled desperately, using threats and warnings to disrupt publication of the article. Sean Berry, the Premier’s media director, advised Bashan in writing to get his two sources on the record so they could “share the grief” if he published “wildly inaccurate” claims.
The story was accurate. But Berry’s behaviour, journalists from other organisations say, is not new. Readers can judge for themselves whether Ms Berejiklian, who is notoriously “hands on” about sweating the small stuff, approved of Berry’s high-handed approach. Sky News reporter Andrew Clennell once wrote about a staff member who left her office after being asked by the Premier to draft a letter to a Year 11 student three times. On Tuesday, following Bashan’s story, team Berejiklian squirmed and fumed. And she fessed up that she had been in her office after having the test and regretted not closing the door for 90 minutes to two hours. She held meetings in that time. “I’ve got to cop that and I deserve it, and I appreciate why people would raise issues about that,” she said. The Australian also confirmed she did not seek a “pair”, which would have allowed her to be absent from parliament while awaiting her results. After recent events, the public is entitled to wonder how well they ever knew “our Gladys”, whose website is simply called gladys.com.au. Asked on Tuesday if she would change COVID guidelines, she told the ABC: “I would never do that.” Complacency was her “biggest fear”. Not always. Trust, once broken, is hard to restore.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
A new year challenge for all in pandemic control	The Australian	Gladys Berejiklian has found the right balance to bid farewell to 2020
Yet again, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has shown judgment, balance and empathy in attempting to calibrate her government’s response to the recent COVID-19 outbreak across Greater Sydney. Her pragmatic, nuanced approach is evident in her attempts to offer people some opportunity to celebrate the end of a very challenging year while minimising the risks of accelerating the spread of the infection through large gatherings. While Sydney will be illuminated by its traditional fireworks display, there will be significant restrictions on crowds assembling in public foreshore parks and vantage points near the harbour. Although regrettable, this is justifiable. The Premier has attempted to provide some reasonable respite for residents by allowing smaller outdoor gatherings while urging people to avoid creating so-called superspreader risks by forming large crowds around Sydney Harbour.
It is easy to conclude that the ghastly year of 2020 thus will end with a whimper rather than a bang. However, Ms Berejiklian is attempting to ensure that the show still will go on, albeit in a safe and somewhat abbreviated manner. The Premier knows that after a year that began with the state’s capital shrouded in bushfire smoke and ended with many residents confined to their homes, people are craving some civic rituals that offer reassuring familiarity and hope for the coming year. By refusing to impose a total lockdown, an unjustified curfew and compulsory mask wearing to maintain a pulse of community life, Ms Berejiklian is demonstrating her capacity for true leadership. Her ability to balance community safety with the maintenance of some semblance of social normality and economic activity has been commendable. It has required judgment. It has required faith in her key advisers. It has required a degree of trust in her community. And it has required no mean amount of moral courage.
The stovepiped, ponderous Victorian system over which Premier Daniel Andrews presided so long as health minister has been ruthlessly exposed by this pandemic. Its lack of accountability was revealed when the Coate inquiry into Victoria’s botched hotel quarantine program reported last week. Lives have been lost through the incompetence of a top-heavy, highly centralised bureaucracy. Despite its authoritarian disposition and fondness for sweeping intrusions into the lives of citizens, the Victorian bureaucracy was rudderless in the headwinds when it counted. Victoria excelled at arresting its citizens, not the coronavirus. Crucial decisions, on which lives and livelihoods depended, evidently occurred by osmosis. No one actually made such decisions. It would be comical in an episode of Yes Minister, but it has had real consequences that are no laughing matter.
Accordingly, the leadership of the NSW Premier has provided a stark and unflattering contrast with that of her counterparts in the other states. In commending Ms Berejiklian, we are not making a partisan political point. In the face of small outbreaks, South Australian Liberal Premier Steven Marshall demonstrated the same knee- jerk authoritarianism as Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, West Australian Premier Mark McGowan and Mr Andrews. Their responses have been panicky border closures that have crippled businesses and inflicted cruel and arbitrary separations on families or denied vital medical treatment in their states. Celebrities and AFL stars entered Queensland to fawning from the fangirl incumbent while ordinary Australians suffered.
Of the Australian states, NSW alone attempted to balance public health and economic viability. So, we support Ms Berejiklian in imposing a graduated series of measures to ensure that Sydneysiders can still view the New Year’s Eve fireworks and draw some comfort from loved ones or gather in some communal spaces to farewell a year that most will prefer to forget, and to welcome one in which we hope our entire nation can begin the long road back to the Australia we recognise. The performance of the NSW authorities has been vindicated in the rapid suppression of case numbers. However, it is not alarmist to acknowledge that complacency at this point still could be dangerous. To govern is to choose. And we believe that Ms Berejiklian, in trademark fashion, has chosen a middle course. She has avoided a draconian cancellation of all public celebrations, with consequences for mental health and civic morale, while recognising that the virus has infiltrated postcodes well outside the northern beaches and even Greater Sydney. Those who dismiss this pandemic as a hoax or a conspiracy designed to establish some form of one-world government would do well to examine the parlous circumstances of Europe and the US, where infection and fatality rates are climbing at an alarming rate. This is neither “fake news” nor a “great reset” fabricated by the deep state. Real people are dying; far too many of them. Inept or complacent governments are reaping a grim harvest. Despite our criticism of some state leaders, our nation across the board can face 2021 with more hope than most nations. Watching fireworks on television at home is a small price to pay to ensure that our largest, most vibrant state continues to function with its economy and civil liberties largely intact.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
A shocker for the Premier State	The Australian	Gladys Berejiklian’s judgment has been brutally exposed Things are bad enough in Victoria and now, in our most populous state of NSW, arguably the best managed in COVID times, we have a decent, competent and very hardworking Premier seemingly unravel in a matter of hours. Gladys Berejiklian, famous for having no private life, has had her poor judgment exposed in the most mortifying way before an anti-corruption inquiry into Daryl Maguire, who it turns out is both her hitherto undeclared ex and her ex-MP. Incredibly, she sacked him in 2018 over an unfolding corruption scandal but dumped him as her secret boyfriend only in August this year when she was secretly hauled before an inquiry and played secret recordings exposing their affair. Naive is the most generous way to describe her decision-making. Humiliating doesn’t capture the indignity of a Premier being caught on tapped phones talking about developers and deals.
This is a shocking turn of events, difficult to absorb. Her profile had been so firmly established as a dedicated public official that it involved a degree of affectionate mockery. She was a goody-two-shoes, the earnest school captain who went on to become Head Girl of NSW. The worst accusation hurled at her was that she was a bit boring, a technocrat too devoted to process, doing everything by the book.
Yet on Monday, as the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption delved into the affairs of Mr Maguire, the former MP for the regional city of Wagga Wagga, the Premier had to endure public scrutiny of their phone intercepts and text messages. Now the whole world knows about her sharing in his triumph of a commission on a property deal. Woohoo! she texted at her man’s $5000 windfall. We learned that Mr Maguire, in his role as a fixer and deal broker, was trying to rope in the Premier’s office to clear a bureaucratic logjam. We overheard as she tried to fend off awkward, potentially compromising details of business affairs that he insisted on sharing. And we know that she knew the fact of his debts, and his schemes to escape them by generating some big fees. At so many levels, personal and political, this must have been an excruciating ordeal for her, and it’s not over. The Gladys we thought we knew would be the harshest judge of this failing. She said as much: “If I had done something wrong I would be the first one to consider my position” — with the caveat that she denies doing anything wrong. She frames it as a personal failing that leaves intact her judgment as Premier. But this painful material is before ICAC only because on its face it represents a potential entanglement of personal interests and public duties. The Premier herself concedes what was being attempted when she protests “this person (her ex) was not able to acquire anything — or his friends, or his associates”. She declares herself shocked and disturbed by what ICAC has revealed to her — and no doubt there are fresh revelations — but she herself is the authority for the proposition that Mr Maguire was not to be trusted in public office. Yet, having sacked him, she continued the relationship up until some months ago. On Monday, she rededicated herself to the people — repeating the mantra that she has “sacrificed” her life to public office. There is no doubt that NSW has been fortunate to have her as a Premier, and politicians of her calibre are too rare. But there is a serious question mark over her judgment, and it will not be easily forgotten that she declared a disgraced ex-MP her “numero uno”.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Summit shames the wrong target	The Australian	Global action on climate change is still well short of promises
There is a ready answer for critics who claim the Morrison government is shamed because Australia was not asked to speak at Boris Johnson’s virtual summit last weekend to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on climate change. As Australia is responsible for only a small fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, it clearly is more appropriate that China, the biggest emitter, be called to tell the world exactly what it intends to do about it. The bar for China is low. The currency of belonging in climate change talks is a public declaration of wanting to be carbon neutral several decades into the future. Further confirmation of good intent comes from declaring a climate emergency. The truth is that when it comes to taking action, it is still a matter for many countries of “look what I say, not what I do”. Collectively, the world is falling well short of the Paris goals. Big pledges from developing countries still are contingent on big financing pledges from the developed world.
With the US excluded because of Donald Trump’s intransigence, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Brazil are being painted as climate laggards. China, responsible for half of the world’s emissions, is allowed to keep increasing its emissions through the coming decade. At the weekend talks, President Xi Jinping fell short of presenting a 2030 climate plan that reflects China’s long-term goal to be carbon neutral by 2060. Instead, Mr Xi promised an incremental strengthening of China’s 2030 climate plan, with no mention of curbing coal.
China has said it will lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by more than 65 per cent from the 2005 level by 2030, increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to about 25 per cent and increase the forest stock volume by six billion cubic metres from the 2005 level. Other pledges to the weekend conference included Britain’s plan to stop financing fossil fuel projects abroad. Canada will lift its carbon taxes to $C170 by 2030. The UN said countries committing to much stronger intentions at the summit included Argentina, Barbados, Canada, Colombia, Iceland and Peru. Far from Australia being the “climate reject”, as Greens leader Adam Bandt claims, Australia’s climate action compares favourably with China’s revised target. The nation’s latest quarterly emissions figures show that, despite a growing economy, Australia’s emissions per capita and the emissions intensity of the economy continue to fall and are at their lowest levels in three decades. In 2019-20, the emissions intensity of the economy was 64.7 per cent below 1990 levels, 43 per cent below 2005 levels, and is projected to fall to 58 per cent below by 2030, essentially what China is proposing. Changes in land management practices in the past decade have contributed to forest cover in Australia increasing faster than in any other OECD country in that period. One reason Australia’s emissions challenge is greater than that of Mr Johnson’s climate-aspirational Britain is that 39.3 per cent of Australia’s total emissions are generated by the production of exports for overseas markets. This includes the production of liquefied natural gas that will be crucial to helping China, Japan and other Asian nations meet their emissions targets. In the year to June, emissions were 513.4 million tonnes — 3 per cent, or 16 million tonnes, lower than in 2018-19. Regardless of the detail, the Morrison government can expect to continue to be the butt of public shaming over its perceived lack of climate action. But the government is correct that promises of carbon neutrality and declarations of a climate emergency can be easily made but do not mean much without a solid plan to get there. Mr Morrison is right to insist that Australia will decide what action it will take on climate, and when.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Summit shames the wrong target	The Australian	Global action on climate change is still well short of promises There is a ready answer for critics who claim the Morrison government is shamed because Australia was not asked to speak at Boris Johnson’s virtual summit last weekend to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on climate change. As Australia is responsible for only a small fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, it clearly is more appropriate that China, the biggest emitter, be called to tell the world exactly what it intends to do about it. The bar for China is low. The currency of belonging in climate change talks is a public declaration of wanting to be carbon neutral several decades into the future. Further confirmation of good intent comes from declaring a climate emergency. The truth is that when it comes to taking action, it is still a matter for many countries of “look what I say, not what I do”. Collectively, the world is falling well short of the Paris goals. Big pledges from developing countries still are contingent on big financing pledges from the developed world.
With the US excluded because of Donald Trump’s intransigence, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Brazil are being painted as climate laggards. China, responsible for half of the world’s emissions, is allowed to keep increasing its emissions through the coming decade. At the weekend talks, President Xi Jingping fell short of presenting a 2030 climate plan that reflects China’s long-term goal to be carbon neutral by 2060. Instead, Mr Xi promised an incremental strengthening of China’s 2030 climate plan, with no mention of curbing coal.
China has said it will lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by more than 65 per cent from the 2005 level by 2030, increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to about 25 per cent and increase the forest stock volume by six billion cubic metres from the 2005 level. Other pledges to the weekend conference included Britain’s plan to stop financing fossil fuel projects abroad. Canada will lift its carbon taxes to $C170 by 2030. The UN said countries committing to much stronger intentions at the summit included Argentina, Barbados, Canada, Colombia, Iceland and Peru. Far from Australia being the “climate reject”, as Greens leader Adam Bandt claims, Australia’s climate action compares favourably with China’s revised target. The nation’s latest quarterly emissions figures show that, despite a growing economy, Australia’s emissions per capita and the emissions intensity of the economy continue to fall and are at their lowest levels in three decades. In 2019-20, the emissions intensity of the economy was 64.7 per cent below 1990 levels, 43 per cent below 2005 levels, and is projected to fall to 58 per cent below by 2030, essentially what China is proposing. Changes in land management practices in the past decade have contributed to forest cover in Australia increasing faster than in any other OECD country in that period. One reason Australia’s emissions challenge is greater than that of Mr Johnson’s climate-aspirational Britain is that 39.3 per cent of Australia’s total emissions are generated by the production of exports for overseas markets. This includes the production of liquefied natural gas that will be crucial to helping China, Japan and other Asian nations meet their emissions targets. In the year to June, emissions were 513.4 million tonnes — 3 per cent, or 16 million tonnes, lower than in 2018-19. Regardless of the detail, the Morrison government can expect to continue to be the butt of public shaming over its perceived lack of climate action. But the government is correct that promises of carbon neutrality and declarations of a climate emergency can be easily made but do not mean much without a solid plan to get there. Mr Morrison is right to insist that Australia will decide what action it will take on climate, and when.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Charismatic St Jacinda’s climate crusade charade	The Australian	Global star of woke politics faces urgent challenges at home
Scott Morrison is hosting Jacinda Ardern in Sydney on Friday for the annual Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ Meeting. It’s usually a low-key gathering to discuss regional security, international trade and co-operation in the Pacific. How best to co-ordinate action on the coronavirus outbreak is top of the bilateral agenda. The leaders appear to have a solid working relationship, as is the way for trans-Tasman affairs. The Black Summer bushfires and the deadly Whakaari/White Island eruption in New Zealand showed how well Mr Morrison and Ms Ardern collaborate. In the wake of the Christchurch terrorist attack being live-streamed and replicated on Facebook, Mr Morrison led an effort at the G20 leaders’ summit to press online platforms to do more to protect users.
A year after Christchurch, New Zealand’s Prime Minister is enjoying global attention, with Time asking on its latest cover how will the millennial political rock star use the moment. “Know us by our deeds,” she told the news magazine. Yet actions at home have yet to match the promises she has made on the world stage. This gap is most pronounced on climate policy. Last August Ms Ardern said Australia had “to ­answer to the Pacific” for its position on ­climate change. She did not mention, conveniently, New Zealand is forecast to fail to meet its Paris target to ­reduce emissions by 30 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030. By contrast Australia is on track to meet its 26 per cent to 28 per cent reduction target, with or without Kyoto carry-over credits. New Zealand failed to meet first-round Kyoto targets and did not sign up to Kyoto for 2020.
That hasn’t stopped Kiwis from talking a big game on CO2 emissions or castigating nations they see as laggards. At last year’s Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu, Ms Ardern asked Mr Morrison to back a UN push for a carbon-­neutral economy by 2050, declaring every ­nation had to “do its bit” to fight global warming. Yet New Zealand has excluded agriculture and methane from its carbon-neutral pledge. That is cute, if not convenient, given agricultural products and meat are New Zealand’s major exports, accounting for 40 per cent of sales. Agriculture makes up half of its CO2 emissions. On Thursday senator Matt Canavan argued online that New Zealand’s “brave” target, welcomed by environmental activist groups, was “literally an example of doing things by half”. Even with some heroic assumptions (a methane vaccine for sheep), official modelling shows net zero emissions by 2050 would smash New Zealand’s agriculture and shrink its economy by 10 to 20 per cent.
Still, it’s the vibe and sound bite that count for some. St Jacinda is the embodiment of activism, globalism and wellness. Among the Green left there’s a bit of PM envy going on — if only Ms Ardern could rule Australia, the world! First, however, she’ll need to turn her charms to her home country, where she is seeking a second term in September. Kiwis gripe that Ms Ardern’s Labour has not delivered on major promises. It pledged to build 100,000 high-quality, low-income houses over a decade via the KiwiBuild program; so far the tally is 315 houses. Ending child poverty may be as elusive for Ms Ardern as it was for Bob Hawke four decades ago. The measure of national success would be broadened beyond GDP, to take into account environmental, social and economic sustainability, a matrix that is attracting interest from Labor here.But hard numbers matter for voters and the New Zealand economy is going sideways. GDP is growing at a touch above 2 per cent. The small trading nation, dependent on China, will be rocked by a drying up of tourists due to the COVID-19 outbreak and a slide in global demand for its exports. Ms Ardern is tethered to periodic shocks from her “coalition of losers” partners. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, a deputy prime minister from the Barnaby Joyce school of parochial populism and deportment, will tug Labour one way. The Greens, fixated on cannabis legalisation and carbon neutrality, whatever the cost, will push the other way. No doubt Mr Morrison will provide a warm welcome, perhaps giving his Kiwi colleague a private run-through on the imminent technology road map he is betting his emissions credibility on. One thing you can be sure about, Australia won’t be goading its Tasman cousins about the hypocrisy of their climate postures or trying to steal the Kiwi leader’s global limelight.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Frydenberg calls forth the ‘power of aspiration’	The Australian	Going for growth is the best antidote to debt and deficit As expected, the budget presents the nation with an ugly set of numbers — the deficit to reach $213.7bn and net debt increasing to $703bn or 36 per cent of gross domestic product this year. Josh Frydenberg, a “glass half full” character, softened the blow, however, forecasting the deficit would fall to $66.9bn by 2023-24. That is ambitious and obviously precludes another big wave of coronavirus wreaking havoc. It clearly presupposes a successful vaccine, borders reopening and no major lockdowns. These could be heroic assumptions. Even without catastrophe, the budget still will be in deficit in 2031. Grim as it sounds, the forecast of net debt peaking at $966bn or 44 per cent of GDP in June 2024 also could be optimistic. That peak, as a share of the economy, would be just half Britain’s current debt, about a third of that in the US and about a quarter of that in Japan. Australia’s solid economic fundamentals at the start of the crisis will help stand us in good stead. Low borrowing costs will work in the nation’s favour. So much so that interest paid on debt will be lower per year for the next four years than it was in 2018-19.
It is a budget with an enormous government footprint, with outlays of public money that are staggering compared with those of other years. Spending will climb by 22.6 per cent compared with last financial year, with the deficit coming in at 11 per cent of GDP. This compares with 4.3 per cent last year and 4.2 per cent post global financial crisis in 2009-10. This is not the year for preaching fiscal prudence, however. The quality of the spend is all important. And Scott Morrison, the Treasurer and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann have thought out their strategy clearly. Far from crowding the economy with a larger public sector, they are getting out of the way of the private sector, leaving it to businesses, workers and consumers to rescue us through the real economy. This beats gratuitous handouts and government-sponsored make-work schemes.
More important than the raw numbers, dramatic as they are, the budget sets out a clear, two-pronged strategy to dig us out of the mire. First, it reaches out to Australians, including many of the most vulnerable, to cushion the fallout of the pandemic with a mix of handouts and a couple of worthwhile reforms. Second, it creates the conditions and incentives for private enterprise to lead recovery. The plan, commendably, does not involve increasing taxes. To the contrary, it brings forward lower, flatter personal tax rates, which The Australian has advocated for more than a decade. By 2024-25, 95 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of no more than 30c in the dollar. This year, more than seven million taxpayers will receive tax relief of $2000 or more.
Workers’ retirement nest eggs will be boosted by another long overdue reform. New superannuation accounts will no longer be created automatically every time a worker changes jobs. And poor performing funds will be required to notify members of their underperformance. The changes will matter to workers’ hip pockets. Super policyholders are paying $450m a year in unnecessary fees as a result of six million multiple accounts. And the $30bn super fees being paid every year exceeds the cost of household gas and electricity bills combined. The online comparison tool “YourSuper”, setting out funds’ returns and fees at a glance, undoubtedly will be as popular and well-used as the My School website. Funds will whinge, but it is a win for consumers and transparency.
The overarching theme of the budget, however, is its practical approach to bolstering business confidence and jobs. The JobMaker hiring credit, payable for up to 12 months to employers who hire JobSeeker recipients aged 16 to 35, is a prudent subsidy, designed to encourage firms to hire new staff for at least 20 hours a week. If Treasury estimates are accurate, it will help wean around 450,000 young people off welfare and into the productive economy. The generous investment incentives, to apply until June 2022, are appropriate for the times.
The government will allow 99 per cent of small, medium and larger businesses, with turnovers of up to $5bn, to write off the full value of any eligible business asset purchased. The goals are clear: to unlock investment, expand productive capacity, boost the order books of supply companies and assist the businesses that will buy, sell, deliver, install and service the new purchases. The measure is well targeted. Even pre-COVID, private sector investment was sluggish, acting as a brake on productivity growth.
The JobMaker and asset write-off initiatives will complement the government’s manufacturing strategy. Rather than a resort to old-fashioned protectionism and picking winners, that strategy is about levering Australia’s comparative advantages, including abundant, affordable energy, to strengthen our economic performance in well-chosen sectors. These include resources technology and critical minerals processing, food and beverage manufacturing, medical products, clean energy and recycling, and the space industry.
The education initiatives also are geared to boosting the productive economy, including an additional $1.2bn to create 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships, with a 50 per cent wage subsidy for businesses that employ them. Funding for 50,000 new higher education short courses in agriculture, health, information technology, science and teaching also are geared to areas of need. Helping more disadvantaged Indigenous students to complete Year 12, to go on to further education or to find jobs is always worthwhile.
If there is a tendency in the budget to distort markets it lies in the property subsidies, especially the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. The measures announced at least have a worthwhile social objective in an era when housing remains prohibitively expensive to many, despite the COVID crisis. An additional $1bn of low-cost finance will support the building of affordable housing. And $150m injected into the Indigenous Home Ownership Program to construct new homes in regional areas will go some way to alleviating a pressing need in remote areas.
Given the bleak economic situation confronting Australia, and most of the world, Mr Frydenberg had a free pass this year to spend. By and large he has not wasted it. The welfare lobby might have wanted fortnightly pensions lifted and a commitment to boost the JobSeeker payment to a specific figure. The latter can be addressed after the current coronavirus supplement payments expire. And aged pensioners will receive an additional $250 payment from December and a further $250 payment from March next year. Given the strong preference of most older Australians to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, the increase of 23,000 home care packages, at a cost of $1.6bn will be welcome support. It brings the total number of places to 180,000, a figure likely to increase as the population ages in coming decades. But for now, at least, 99 per cent of applicants seeking an in-home aged-care package have access to some form of in-home support. That is something the nation can be proud about. The ageing of the population, unfortunately, will become a more difficult challenge judging by the budget papers. They project the population growth will slow to its lowest rate in more than a century — falling from 1.2 per cent in 2019-20 to just 0.2 per cent this year. This is mainly due to the fall in net migration. Long term, this poses a concern for growth.
Amid the projections of crippling debt and deficits, the economy is forecast to shrink by 3.75 per cent this calendar year and unemployment to peak at 8 per cent in the December quarter. Under the government’s strategy to create the conditions for private sector growth, however, the economy is forecast to grow by 4.25 per cent next year, and unemployment to fall to 6.5 per cent by the June quarter in 2022. Once it falls comfortably below 6 per cent and recovery has taken hold, Mr Frydenberg foreshadows a change of strategy. That will involve shifting from providing temporary and targeted support to stabilising net debt as a share of the economy. As he says: “We will then rebuild our fiscal buffers so that we can be prepared for the next economic shock.’’ While the sea of red ink is unlike anything in Australians’ memories, the budget is true to liberal economic values. Despite gargantuan debt, the budget, in extraordinary circumstances, is essentially about personal responsibility, reward for effort and the power of aspiration.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Brave attempt to stop tech parasites destroying news	The Australian	Google and Facebook got rich plundering content and data
The Morrison government, on the advice of the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, finally has taken decisive action to make Google and Facebook pay for the content they now steal from news organisations. The move will see Australia become the first jurisdiction to impose a legal regime, including financial penalties, around the wanton behaviour of these digital superpowers. The vast platforms have cannibalised and made stupendous profits from content produced by the news media. It has been a long haul to reform, following a landmark 18-month ACCC investigation. But the bad faith shown by amoral global tech giants in negotiations on a voluntary code of conduct with publishers, including our parent, News Corp Australia, was an open scandal. It was clear to ACCC chief Rod Sims a deal on payment for content, the fundamental issue, was not going to happen by the November deadline, nor was there any chance of meaningful progress at all.
The mandatory code, which will be legislated after a July deadline for the ACCC design process, would reverse the power imbalance and force the big tech companies to pay for the content, share their consumer data and be subject to rules on the rankings of news on their platforms. Writing in our commentary section on Monday, Josh Frydenberg diplomatically described the move as seeking to “create a level playing field where market power is not misused, companies get a fair go and there is appropriate compensation for the production of original news content”. We see it as restoring a semblance of the rule of law to the digital jungle, where the tech monsters prowl at every level — as apex predators, virtually owning the internet, as well as parasites invading the central nervous systems of creators in the content kingdom.
As the Treasurer noted, for every $100 spent by advertisers in Australia on online advertising, excluding classifieds, $47 goes to Google, $24 to Facebook and $29 to other participants. In Australia, this market is worth $9bn a year and has grown more than eightfold since 2005. In its historic report, the ACCC found more than 98 per cent of online searches on mobile devices are with Google, while Facebook has 17 million users who are connected to its platform for at least a half-hour a day. These untamed beasts, respectfully, have simply become too big to flail. What is their modus operandi, apart from inserting themselves between two consenting parties? Last year Mr Sims told this newspaper: “The business models of Google and Facebook rely on customers not actually understanding what data is being collected from them or how that data is being used. This problem needs to be comprehended and then it needs to be fixed.” Are traditional news outlets, allegedly outsmarted and disrupted, simply having a sook? Hardly. The coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic calamity have been mega-stories for media outlets. Australians are hungry for news, which is a boon for every trusted organisation in our industry, regardless of world view or funding. Our newspaper’s digital audience more than doubled from February to last month; with 4.9 million readers, our readership grew by 110 per cent over the year. Yet the business model for news is precarious. Readers pay for our content, but more generally news organisations depend on advertising in a variety of formats. Putting the economy in an induced coma to suppress COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on almost every business. But the pernicious threat to our industry from the monopoly power of global tech thieves put us in an unsafe position before the health and economic crises reached our shores.
The news business is at a tipping point, a fact the Morrison government almost became blase about. Perhaps it was immobilised by the sheer wizardry of the algorithms and slick corporate potency of foreign brigands. More likely, both sides of politics placed too much trust in the tech titans and their paid lobbyists. The giants would do the right thing, they promised, by throwing traditional media players some scraps. It was flagrantly patronising and dishonest. Canberra, armed with ACCC analysis, finally twigged and took a brave policy leap into the unknown and untried. As Mr Frydenberg concedes, it won’t be easy to make Google and Facebook pony up. In 2014, Spain passed laws requiring Google to pay news outlets for article extracts; Google duly closed Google News. Last year, France tried to protect copyright of news content by requiring permission and compensation for material reproduced online; Google refused to pay and now will not display French news media unless able to do so for free.The Morrison government is now demanding the giants behave ethically and recognise and remunerate creators and copyright holders. Why is this so novel? Google and Facebook will be directed to share data, properly display news content and pay a fair price for it. While it’s better late than never, there’s no time to waste because news outlets are distressed and disappearing. The ACCC is charged with designing a formula and mechanism to calculate value and a process for arbitration in the case of stalemate. Yes, the new code will have enforcement and penalty provisions, as Mr Sims suggests. But the size of the revenue share is pivotal. As executive chairman of News Corp Australasia Michael Miller argues, the price for content must not only be fair it should be “very significant”. The digital monopolists didn’t become trillion-dollar titans by playing nice. Until they pay for news content, they imperil the entire ecosystem that keeps Australians properly informed, in crisis or in clover.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Jobs agenda drives new wave of workplace reform	The Australian	Government IR push will test the strength of new co-operation
The COVID-19 pandemic has delivered a rare opportunity for warring parties to come together in a spirit of co-operation to safeguard the common good. Rising levels of debt, high unemployment, trade tensions and uncertainty about the global economic outlook as a result of the pandemic make all efforts to boost productivity and remove impediments to growth more important than ever.
There exists broad agreement across the political and social spectrum that job creation is the priority task at hand. The COVID-19 emergency has enabled a period of deep collaboration between government, employer and trade unions, unseen since the Prices and Incomes Accord period of the Hawke and Keating governments in the 1980s and 1990s. It is time to see if those discussions and a newfound co-operation led by Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter and ACTU secretary Sally McManus can bear the promised fruit.
Mr Porter is preparing to introduce wide-ranging legislation to parliament that will set the tone of Australia’s industrial relations landscape for the future. The federal government has reset the clock on its approach, abandoning the union-restricting Ensuring Integrity Bill that was politically divisive and seen as a continuation of the Howard-era WorkChoices reforms that galvanised the union movement but delivered significant benefits in terms of workplace flexibility and for the economy.
The ACTU leadership has been actively engaged in the latest negotiations but it remains to be seen whether it and the ALP can truly change their spots. Already, there are signs of trouble ahead.
Under Mr Porter’s planned changes, the thuggery and industrial excesses of wayward unions will be addressed by allowing the demerger of super unions, notably the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union. As Paul Kelly wrote in The Weekend Australian on Saturday, the bill to allow demergers strikes at the foundations of the big amalgamated unions. But given the widespread concerns about the construction wing of the CFMEU and its Victorian secretary, John Setka, the bill is not expected to be strongly opposed by either the ALP or ACTU.
Further details are now emerging on measures the government will take flowing from consultations of five working groups which brought together employers, unions and other stakeholders. Mr Porter says that getting the IR settings right to help create jobs is the most critical challenge facing Australia in a century. Rather than radical change, Mr Porter says, the Morrison government’s approach will be practical, incremental solutions to key issues that are known barriers to creating jobs.
As Kelly explained, the omnibus bill seeks to ­revive enterprise bargaining, with a 21-day approval deadline to fast-track agreements; it makes it easier for employers to pay retail workers for longer hours; it introduces a new system of “loaded rates” operating across key awards to enable employers to pay a single higher rate rather than work through multiple penalty rates and allowances; it authorises longer-run greenfields or “life of projects” agreements in the resources sector; it provides for ­better conversion from casual to permanent employment; and it seeks to address a “double-dipping” system for leave entitlements.
Mr Porter has given detail on how the changes to casual work will be framed in the new laws. He says casual jobs will regrow faster if the significant confusion and legal uncertainty surrounding casual employment arrangements can be overcome. That confusion was stoked by a Federal Court decision, WorkPac v Rossato, that businesses may now have to pay for sick leave and other leave as well as the 25 per cent casual loading that is meant to compensate for those benefits. The cost of the decision to employers is estimated at between $18bn and $39bn.
Mr Porter is right to say that this uncertainty, coupled with the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes casual employment, has made many employers reluctant to hire new staff. The government’s IR legislation seeks to address these problems via three interrelated measures. First is to introduce a statutory definition of casual employment into the Fair Work Act. Second is to enable employers to offset the 25 per cent loading already paid against claims for holiday and sick leave. The third is to create a new minimum standard for casual conversion so that casuals who work regular shift patterns can move — if desired — to part-time or full-time employment after 12 months.
Mr Porter says the government’s definition of casual employment is likely broader than some business groups had wanted and narrower than unions had argued. Ms McManus has said the ACTU does not support the changes for casual workers. Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott has indicated employers are taking a pragmatic approach. It is early days but it will be a remarkable achievement if the Morrison government can secured a new round of workplace flexibility without unleashing a repeat of the ACTU’s anti-WorkChoices campaign that was waged against the Howard and Abbott governments.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
States must be accountable for failures over Covid-19	The Australian	Government bungling has cost lives and wreaked havoc
The accountability of governments has never mattered more, evidenced by Australia’s tragic tale of two cities. Those grieving COVID-19 victims have been left ropeable and numb by the tepid, formulaic apology of Gladys Berejiklian and the mealy-mouthed defence of Health Minister Brad Hazzard for the Ruby Princess debacle. In Melbourne, no explanation, however slickly delivered, can justify Daniel Andrews’s government sitting on a critical detail it has known for weeks. That is, about 99 per cent of the second wave of coronavirus, which has killed 334 people and precipitated the stage four lockdown, decimating the economy, arose from the government’s catastrophic hotel quarantine program. Those who have lost loved ones have a right to be deeply aggrieved. So do the owners of small businesses whose doors have closed for the last time. And so does a generation of young people whose education has been disrupted, damaging their career options.
In the early months of stern but necessary restrictions on our liberties during the first wave of COVID-19, Australians were assured we were facing a common peril — all in this together. That slogan now has given way to evasiveness by politicians and some of their expert advisers, as glaring incompetence and complacency have been revealed from the inquiries into deadly failures of process. Nobody would deny that federal and state leaders are shouldering onerous burdens. They are making life-and-death decisions in a rapidly changing environment against an invisible, sinister foe that exploits failure. But politicians are elected and paid to serve the public, not to wield power without responsibility. We do not gratuitously attack them for failures. We want them to succeed. And in crises, even the most capable, motivated people will make mistakes. However, with power also comes responsibility. Above all, the public wants to know lessons have been learned from such grave failures that will help prevent recurrences.
The pandemic has seen some disturbing trendsthat go to the heart of our system of government and to the values of parliamentary supremacy and ministerial responsibility. Our Constitution sets out key provisions of how the nation is to function. Other norms of political decency depend on longstanding conventions. If the Constitution is irrelevant to the present crisis, then when was this decision made and by whom? When, for instance, may we expect the restoration of our rights to free intercourse among the states? Is there legal advice as to how fundamental decisions have been made, especially the call-out of the Australian Defence Force and border closures? In the early stages of the pandemic, some informality and innovation was expedient and might well have saved lives. But the time for executive decrees formulated in Zoom conferences surely has passed. While frontline health workers and those maintaining supply chains have faced risks daily, federal parliament has not sat. Neither has the Legislative Assembly in Victoria. Instead of rigorous scrutiny in parliaments accountable to the public, we have been governed by an ad hoc process with dubious constitutional legitimacy. Even if the improvised processes had been effective, no liberal democracy worthy of the name should have acquiesced so lightly in government by decree. In the two world wars, there was an inexorable accumulation of fiscal power by the commonwealth. But the present crisis has spawned a strange inversion. States unilaterally have closed their borders, at heavy cost to small and medium-sized businesses as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has noted. In Queensland and Western Australia, these damaging closures appear to be posturing for domestic political advantage. The closures, arguably, are unconstitutional. The federal government needs to demand genuine collaboration from all the states in return for the enormous financial assistance it is providing. As Paul Kelly writes on Wednesday, Scott Morrison is actually funding border closures through JobSeeker payments. But the Prime Minister should not expect any collegiality from the states when he faces the people with huge unemployment, a depressed private sector and a mountain of debt to bequeath to young people voting for the first time. Mr Morrison and the Coalition will be judged on the state of the national economy, which is being crippled by maladministration, especially in Victoria, and parochial selfishness in Queensland and WA. As voter anger and despair rise, Mr Morrison could learn to his regret that not all governments are “in this together”. He has scope to remind premiers that unless they wish to take back their powers to raise income taxes and be financially accountable at the ballot box, they need to remember that at Federation we formed a single indissoluble commonwealth. Fundamental principles of governance are the road map through crises. Such principles are needed to steer us through this pandemic and should not be abandoned because of it.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
NT inquest details gross neglect	The Australian	Government failure has become routine in some areas The coronial inquest into the deaths of three Indigenous youngsters — Ms B, 17; Master JK, 13; and Master W, 12 — from petrol sniffing in separate Arnhem Land communities has drawn national attention to harsh realities many people believed or hoped had been addressed. But tough laws and low-aromatic opal fuel have not stopped petrol sniffing and solvent abuse, as northern correspondent Amos Aikman reported last week. The inquest heard the Top End Health Service received 163 referrals about petrol sniffing in the first half of 2020, mostly about children, some as young as seven.
The short lives under examination highlight the horror facing young people in that area and the inadequacy of the NT government’s response. In Ms B’s case, deputy coroner Kevin Currie, who acted as counsel assisting during the hearing, said: “Her sniffing was demonstrably because of the trauma of being raped.” She was raped again, present at a cousin’s suicide and repeatedly bashed by her boyfriend.
A department manager conceded his staff should have found Master JK at risk of severe harm on at least 10 occasions. But no treatment plan was enacted. Master W’s family repeatedly sought help but health authorities denied access to rehab a month before he died despite being told he was co-opting 5–7-year-olds into sniffing. All young Australians, regardless of race or where they live, deserve far better.
Mr Currie has urged Coroner Greg Cavanagh to find “outrageous” disregard for the law by the NT health department may be substantially to blame for the three deaths. Bureaucrat Richard Campion conceded for the second time in three years that staff broke the law by not providing proper treatment to children caught sniffing petrol. Health Minister Natasha Fyles and the NT government have big questions to answer. Mr Cavanagh said on Monday Ms Fyles had reassured him the problems were being fixed long before the children died in 2018-19. That was clearly not the case. The time for reviews is long past. NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner and his government must start doing their jobs. Young lives are at stake.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Job growth a welcome sign but more reform needed	The Australian	Government has lost its way in fight for industrial relations overhaul
A strong bounceback in employment in February has given cheer to the federal government and confirmed its economic strategy to pull the nation back from the COVID-19-induced recession is working. Scott Morrison says there are now more jobs in Australia than before the pandemic. The country’s unemployment rate dropped from 6.3 per cent to 5.8 per cent in February, with 88,700 new jobs created in the month. The Prime Minister says there is still more work to be done, particularly for young people. Josh Frydenberg says all of the jobs created were full-time, and more than 80 per cent had gone to women.
The boom in jobs growth will give the Prime Minister and his Treasurer confidence to stick to the planned withdrawal of the JobKeeper wage subsidies at the end of the month. Some exceptions have been made for special cases, including more than 8000 airline employees unable to work because of international border closures who will keep JobKeeper for another seven months. But, as Mr Morrison told reporters on Thursday: “It (JobKeeper) has done its job.” Economics correspondent Patrick Commins reports the Reserve Bank, Treasury and private sector economists expect the impact from the end of the wage subsidy will be temporary, and that the jobless rate will continue to fall over the second half of the year. Given the jobs growth numbers announced on Thursday, opposition arguments for a blanket extension for all workers cannot be justified. Rather than welfare, the emphasis must be on continuing to grow the jobs pie.
Unfortunately for business, the government has shown it does not have the stomach to fight for its already compromised industrial relations reforms, which were designed to improve productivity and unlock further jobs growth into the future. Welcoming the jobs figures, Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott says now is the time for business to take the baton from government and do the heavy lifting on job creation. The list of requirements for business includes the right tax incentives, a workplace relations system that encourages job creation, and cuts to red tape that inhibits investment. The government’s decision to ditch the majority of proposed IR reforms demonstrates it will not be an easy road. Further obstacles include the deferral of a Senate vote to end the investment-sapping responsible lending laws, and threats to unwind legislated tax cuts which will benefit high income earners.
The government’s modest IR reforms were opposed by Labor and eventually scuppered by obstructionist South Australian crossbencher Stirling Griff. A shadow of the proposed IR reforms was passed on Thursday, allowing casuals to request conversion to permanent employment. But the opportunity to reinvigorate the enterprise bargaining agreement system, established during the Hawke/Keating era, has essentially been lost. The BCA says the nation has been condemned to the slow lane and Australian workers condemned to lower wages as a result. Mr Morrison says the government entered the IR reform process on the basis it could play an important role in assisting the economic recovery. But with Attorney-General Christian Porter, the architect of the bill, embroiled in controversy and absent from parliament, the government lacked the firepower to fight obstructions in the Senate. Mr Morrison accused Labor and some Senate members of working against the government, and said they did not share his passion for creating jobs. “I’m a practical person, too,” Mr Morrison said. “If this Senate says it doesn’t want to support these measures, we will look for another way.” In political terms, the government’s decision to walk back further from IR reform after first dropping its proposed exemptions to the better off overall test (BOOT) robs the ALP of an opportunity to replay the fight over Work Choices that helped defeat the Howard government. Unfortunately, pragmatism will only go so far. To keep the momentum going on the welcome economic recovery the government must be prepared to step into the ring and fight for business so that it can deliver jobs into the future and cement the economic recovery now clearly under way.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Strike a better balance for project approval and land	The Australian	Government must not waste any time to fix a broken system
There’s no love for the creaky, bloated 20-year-old Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The law is meant to strike a balance between competing interests but it is no longer fit for purpose. It neither aids economic progress nor adequately protects our iconic places. Last week National Farmers Federation president Fiona Simson told the National Press Club that “for too long, draconian and complex environmental regulation has shackled farm businesses”. So-called green tape is a drag on mining, too, with six peak mining and resources groups pushing for an overhaul of the Act, calling for the removal of “unnecessary duplication and complexity” to provide greater certainty for businesses. Delays on big projects can cost companies up to $1m a day. Lawfare also has been a major hurdle to projects such as the Adani and New Acland coalmines in Queensland, a salmon farm in Tasmania and tourist facilities.
According to the Institute of Public Affairs, the lawfare provision of the EPBC Act had put $65bn of investment at risk by holding up major projects, such as dams, coalmines and roads, in court for a total of 10,100 days, or almost 28 years, since 2000. Last month, the Australian National Audit Office slammed the Environment Department’s handling of approvals for major projects. Apart from delays, the Auditor-General found problems with the quality of decisions in protecting national and world heritage sites, marine areas and water resources. The average time overrun for decisions was 116 days, with 79 per cent of approvals containing conditions that did not comply with process or contained clerical errors. According to the report, the measure of how well environmental protection laws were working was limited by the “the absence of effective monitoring, reporting and evaluation arrangements”.
Presented with this evidence of sub-optimal processes and poor all-round outcomes, the Morrison government has vowed to address the Act’s myriad failings. It made a $25m “congestion-busting” funding injection. As well, it launched a full-scale review, which considered 30,000 submissions, by Graeme Samuel, the former head of the competition watchdog. On Monday, Professor Samuel issued an interim report that found broken trust in a system that was slow and cumbersome. It serves no one’s interest. The average time taken for a large industrial project to be approved is 1013 days, and that’s before court challenges and onerous post-approval requirements. “The operation of the Act is dated and inefficient, and it is not fit to manage current or future environmental challenges, particularly in light of climate change,” he found.
Professor Samuel outlines sweeping change, forcing greater responsibility on to the states to fast-track projects and slash regulation. It makes sense to have “single-touch approvals”, as proposed, to remove duplication with Canberra. Environment Minister Sussan Ley will negotiate with the states to accredit them to carry out assessments and approvals on the commonwealth’s behalf. She said the government would develop national environmental standards by the end of next month to underpin the new bilateral agreements. The pandemic and its associated shutdowns, which have put investment on ice and led to a huge drop in employment, have raised the stakes. Reform demands nothing less than a swift overhaul.
Significantly, the report found both state and federal governments had failed in their obligations to traditional owners. “There is a culture of tokenism and symbolism,” it says. “The EPBC Act prioritises the views of Western science, and Indigenous knowledge and views are diluted in the formal provision of advice to decision-makers.” More is needed to “support better engagement with Indigenous Australians and to respectfully incorporate traditional knowledge of country in how the environment is managed”. Ms Ley said she would work with Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt and state ministers to modernise the protection of Indigenous heritage.
The Morrison government has rejected the report’s recommendation for an “independent cop on the beat” to oversee enforcement of new rules. Labor and environment groups had championed a US-style Environmental Protection Agency. Ms Ley also ruled out expanding the Act to include climate triggers, as did the report, arguing the current framework for regulating greenhouse gas and other emissions would be retained. While Labor is wedged, as Graham Lloyd writes, the review is also asking the government to get serious about policing. Professor Samuel has found the current collaborative approach to monitoring, compliance, enforcement and assurance is too weak and penalties do not provide an adequate deterrent. There will be a consultation period and the full report is due by the end of October. While devolution is sensible, there should be scope to finesse, streamline and buttress different parts of the Act in coming months to achieve better outcomes. As Lloyd argues, the ultimate objective is a system that will give business confidence to make decisions and environment groups less incentive to lodge frivolous legal actions to stall development. As we emerge from the pandemic, with millions of workers idle, investment in a deep hole and confidence shattered, the nation needs new projects, of all sizes, to get back on track. The Morrison government should not a waste a moment to restore trust and reliability in an approvals system that is well beyond its use-by date.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Morrison stakes centre ground on climate policy	The Australian	Government wants innovators and business to get on with the job Scott Morrison has taken the pulse of mainstream Australia and built a centrist position on climate change action that puts the onus on science and business ingenuity to set the pace of change. The Prime Minister’s agenda outlined in a speech to the National Press Club on Monday supports a net-zero target as soon as possible, puts technology at the top of the agenda and rules out taxing carbon dioxide emissions as a way to speed the process. It is confirmation of the approach doggedly being pursued by Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor as he tackles the difficult task of reducing emissions from electricity generation without affecting the price or reliability of supply. As we have argued he should, Mr Morrison has favoured a pragmatic response. This will not satisfy those who want more immediate and drastic action or Coalition members who want the government to underwrite new investment in coal-fired power.
By staking out the middle ground, Mr Morrison has made the task more difficult for the opposition, which is signalling its own rethink of its climate change approach. In a shadow cabinet reshuffle last week Anthony Albanese moved his close ally, Mark Butler, from the climate portfolio and replaced him with Chris Bowen. The implication is that the Opposition Leader does not want to risk repeating the mistake of the 2019 election when an ambitious but uncosted climate plan lost the party credibility and votes, particularly in the coalmining regions of Queensland. As things now stand, Labor has a policy for Australia to be carbon neutral by 2050 but no plan for 2030 or 2035 and no explanation of how it plans to achieve its goal.
A key part of Mr Morrison’s approach has been to tackle head-on a perception, reinforced by the opposition and climate activists, that Australia is falling behind the rest of the world on action and that the Coalition is hopelessly divided on the issue. In his press club speech Mr Morrison highlighted the fact Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions fell by 3 per cent in the year to June last year, to their lowest levels since 1998. This puts emissions at nearly 17 per cent below 2005 levels, on the way to a 2030 target of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels. Australia’s performance compares to reductions of about 9 per cent on average across the OECD, 1 per cent in New Zealand and less than 1 per cent in Canada.
The positive news for Australia is reinforced by new figures released on Tuesday that show a record seven gigawatts of new renewable capacity was installed last year, 11 per cent higher than the previous record set in 2019. In 2019, Australia deployed new renewable capacity at least 10 times faster per person than the global average and four times faster per person than China, Europe or the US. Last year Australia invested $7.7bn or $299 per person in renewable energy, more than Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and the US. Australia now has the highest solar capacity per person of any country in the world (644 watts per person) and the highest wind and solar capacity of any country outside Europe (804W per person). These figures provide a credible response to claims of inaction.
The comparison with New Zealand, in particular, illustrates that talking about targets is a very different thing to achieving them. New Zealand has declared a climate emergency and set a net-zero emissions target for 2050. However, to date New Zealand has trailed Australia in action and the country’s Climate Change Commission has said in a draft report released on Sunday that the country must lift its near-term targets by 30 per cent and include agriculture, which currently is exempt.
Mr Morrison says the speed of Australia reaching net zero will be determined by advances made in science and technology needed to transform commercially not only major economies and countries but also the developing world. Australia has set a technology road map and agreed to co-operate with the Biden administration in the US on research and development. Mr Morrison is banking on voters agreeing with him that growing the pie on affordable, low-emissions options through research is a better strategy than trying to modify behaviour through increased taxes. The government has shown it is prepared to support investment in research and development in priority areas including energy storage, carbon capture, hydrogen and lower-emissions steel and cement making. Major corporations increasingly are entering private arrangements to offset their carbon dioxide emissions, including through investment in land-based solutions and regenerative agriculture, opening new business opportunities for Australian farmers. These actions are being taken out of self-interest, not because of government mandate. By pulling Coalition policy to the centre on climate change, Mr Morrison is working to avoid the pitfalls of former prime ministers Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, who lost their jobs because they were considered to be doing too little or too much on the issue. Mr Morrison is admitting there is a problem and calling on the innovators to get on with the job.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
National interest comes first in foreign relations	The Australian	Governments and universities should be on team Australia
Scott Morrison’s preparedness to tear up Victoria’s Belt and Road agreement with China and take control of the deals with foreign powers by universities and lower tiers of government is a vital assertion of national sovereignty. The move deserves bipartisan support. The Prime Minister’s use of the external affairs power will bring states, territories, local councils and universities into line after a multitude of agreements between them and other nations. The action is courageous, constitutional and overdue. The Australian intelligence community repeatedly has warned of the perils of Chinese soft-power ploys. The warnings were ridiculed last year by Paul Keating as emanating from “nutters” who had gone “berko”. Events since, however, have vindicated our intelligence professionals. Too many people in key positions have been lulled into complacency by a regime that is ruthless in exploiting every facet of its national power to expand its influence.
The foreign relations bill, to be introduced to parliament next week, has been necessitated by concerns over Victoria’s Belt and Road Initiative, mounting cyber attacks on Australian institutions by foreign powers and growing infiltration of Australian universities, especially by Chinese interests. It comes amid increasing strategic concerns about Chinese aggression across the Indo-Pacific region, especially towards Hong Kong and Taiwan, and in the South China Sea. There, unlawful maritime claims have been backed by inexorable militarisation of artificial features and the declaration of air defence identification zones. This is highly provocative. China’s intention to undermine the regional security architecture on which Australia’s prosperity and freedom have been built since 1945 is plain for all but useful idiots and the wilfully blind to see.
It is not the role of state governments, under the Constitution, to enter into bilateral agreements with foreign powers, especially those whose conduct is manifestly at odds with central tenets of our defence and national security policies. On Thursday, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews’s spiky response to the Morrison government’s initiative showed he is unable — or unwilling — to grasp that point. His attempt to dismiss the Prime Minister’s concerns reveal a narrow parochialism. Mr Andrews, unfortunately, ignored warnings raised by Mr Morrison in June over Victoria’s BRI agreement. He also snubbed ASIO security briefings offered to him after missing the key national cabinet meeting where the new foreign government transparency scheme was explained to other state leaders. In signing Victoria on to the BRI, Mr Andrews was effectively masquerading as the head of a sovereign nation. That pretence is about to stop. China’s aims in pursuing the BRI do not accord with Australia’s interests. Beijing uses the BRI to build a geopolitical and economic network on its terms, as the one-party state asserts itself as a global and regional power with a view to diminishing US and Western influence. Evidence of its manipulation of small states is clear in the southwest Pacific and in Sri Lanka under the BRI. It must not be allowed to happen here.
It is eminently sensible that, under the new bill, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will take stock of commercial arrangements and partnerships entered into by Australian universities with other nations. This will be an opportunity to scrutinise the Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes, which have long served as Chinese propaganda agencies on Western campuses. This week, The Australian’s investigation by Sharri Markson and Kylar Loussikian into China’s clandestine Thousand Talents program has revealed that dozens of leading scientists at major Australian universities are giving the Chinese Communist Party ­access to their technology and inventions in return for generous second salaries of up to $150,000, funded by China, and other benefits. Technology and inventions paid for by Australian taxpayers could be used to advance China’s military and intelligence interests. Incidents such as the retribution meted out to University of Queensland student Drew Pavlou, 21, for protesting against China’s suspension of guaranteed liberties in Hong Kong showed the influence the Chinese regime wields in some universities.
Mr Morrison has been at pains not to single out China when answering questions about the new legislation. But China has denounced the proposed bill, accusing Australia of “putting bacteria” into the relationship. It may respect the strength behind the decision, although it increasingly has been ready of late to punish trading partners, including Australia, for resisting Beijing’s bullying. The government can also expect plenty of criticism from vested interests in Australia’s business and academic sectors. Anthony Albanese’s response to the government’s move has been sensible, although frontbencher Mark Dreyfus was juvenile in branding the move to veto foreign deals with states as “Trumpian”. We agree with Mr Dreyfus that allowing the ill-considered leasing of the Port of Darwin to a Chinese company in 2015 was a bad error. It would not happen now. Universities are entitled to be concerned about research, although there is a big difference between mutually beneficial collaboration and selling out to foreign interests. Foreign policy is not the domain of state governments. National security is not the domain of amateurs or, worse, academics whose bread is buttered by a foreign power. By drawing this bright line in the sand Mr Morrison has acted decisively in the national interest. The initiative warrants bipartisan support.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Controlling virus vital in restoring economy, jobs	The Australian	Greater co-operation would lift productivity in workplaces The clock is ticking, as Scott Morrison said on Friday, when it comes to the economic support measures seeing Australians through the coronavirus pandemic. For now, 6.1 million people are being supported by the JobKeeper program and 1.6 million by JobSeeker. The government has got Australians’ backs but there is no money tree at the back of the parliamentary garden, as Josh Frydenberg has pointed out. In an interview with Simon Benson on Monday, the Prime Minister identified the need to forge a new pact between workers, business, community groups and government to foster productivity and economic recovery. It is in the interests of all sectors that such a challenge be approached in the co-operative spirit that has stood the nation in good stead through the COVID-19 crisis. Co-operation would increase the chances of businesses and jobs being salvaged, confidence being restored and new opportunities being created. On the anniversary of his stunning election win last year, Mr Morrison has also recognised the opportunity to build a more effective federation post-pandemic. It is a worthwhile aspiration. The COAG process has been mired in red tape and bureaucracy for too long.
For good reason, as Mr Morrison told Benson, avoiding a second wave of infection was his main priority for now. The Reserve Bank concurs. Controlling the virus, the RBA said recently, would allow a stronger economic recovery, limiting near-term damage to business and household balance sheets and driving a faster economic recovery. Australia’s success in getting the virus under control allows us to face the challenge of economic rebuilding from a stronger starting point than most nations. Some of our closest allies, such as the US and the UK, and other G20 nations, face the same economic imperatives while still struggling to prevent hundreds of deaths a day from COVID-19. Australians recognise the success of our health system in curtailing the virus to date. Almost 70 per cent of respondents in the latest Newspoll, published on Monday, are confident about the preparedness of the public health system. And 80 per cent are confident about the amount of information provided about how to protect themselves. Many of the crowds flocking to beaches, parks, cafe strips and shopping precincts at the weekend might need a reminder, however. States need to double down on the social-distancing and hand-washing messages as they further ease restrictions.
Provided proper precautions are taken, the public’s enthusiasm for getting out and spending is a positive. But governments and business agree that allowing the economy to open up, then having to backtrack and reintroduce restrictions in response to larger-than-expected outbreaks, would be disastrous for the recovery.
Vital as the health response to coronavirus has been and must remain, the next two to three months, as John Howard warned last week, will be much harder for the government than the past two to three months. The public, Mr Howard said, is likely to expect the country to exit the pandemic with as much finesse as the health threat was handled at its peak. The international economic shambles will impact on Australia. And the heavy toll of the COVID-19 crisis on the nation’s entrepreneurial class, reported on Monday, is a sign of the damage that has been caused. Australian National University research shows that more than four in five self-employed Australians have suffered a significant hit to their income.
The dilemma the Morrison government faces, as Paul Kelly has written, is that current support being provided through JobKeeper and other measures is unsustainable in the long term. On the other hand, if the economy is not strong enough to sustain jobs when JobKeeper is due to end after six months, the government will face the problem of what to do.
While Mr Morrison will be held accountable in political terms, much will depend on the states and their willingness to let their economies open up, while at the same time guarding against the virus. One key point to be resolved will be when to reopen state borders to allow domestic travel for business, family reasons and holidays. The issue has emerged as a bone of contention between NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. The challenge for Ms Palaszczuk is to strike the right balance between sensible precaution and the need for economic rebuilding. The same goes for Mr Morrison, who says “we cannot allow our fear of going backwards from stopping us from going forwards”. At the same time, he acknowledges that Australia is no more immune to COVID-19 than it was three months ago and that the “right here, right now’’ of keeping the virus in check must not be overlooked. Strong protections have been built into the health system. But until the virus is no longer a threat, economic rebuilding will remain a difficult challenge.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
EDITORIAL It’s worth avoiding worst of this virus	The Northern Advocate	Growing frustration with lockdown restrictions, especially during this second outbreak in Auckland, is understandable.
People are generally willing to comply with unusual temporary rules when they see the threat as warranted and that the authorities are holding up their end to ensure public safety.
For most people in the city, that is probably still the case. But the consensus that people bought into earlier this year has frayed.
For a section of the community, official fumbles over border testing and isolation, and the infection flare-up in the community, have eroded trust and raised doubts about the Government’s messaging.
The weekend’s small anti-lockdown march in Auckland, where people were mostly maskless, could be a sign of further discontent to come.
Cabinet will meet today to decide whether to change alert levels. A drop from level 3 to 2 in Auckland will depend upon the latest health information about the cluster and any other cases.
The lockdown and actions to move infected people into isolation no doubt helped to limit the spread and aid the impressive detective work to trace cases.
But with the second outbreak a reality, it is no longer just speculation for operators of small businesses to wonder how many more of these can they handle.
Politically the Government has had a difficult job working out when and where to apply carrot and stick measures to ensure co-operation and compliance. Judgements and assessments have had to be made on the run in this complex crisis.
The Government has at least shown that it can learn from, adapt and respond to problems, but a lot of damage can be inflicted while officials play catch-up. Prevention with the goal of reducing the health risk to the public has to be the top priority.
With a bit of distance, it seems a special focus on border oversight and with the toughest rules saved for entry points should have been obvious much earlier. Simple priorities can get lost in nuance.
A border tsar tasked with ensuring the operation was run securely and according to the Government’s stated strategy could have made a difference. National’s idea for a border agency is a simple concept but sometimes clearly defined lines are what’s required. Here, we really do not want to import the ongoing problems and higher rates of virus spread seen overseas. We have to hunker down and wait it out.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
IMF has wrong Covid prescription	The Australian	Growing the economy will always be better than higher tax imposts With the vaccine rollout under way, business leaders and governments are calculating how best to recover from the fiscal shock and increased debt load delivered by the pandemic. Australia has been fortunate to date, with the bounce-back from the COVID-inspired recession quicker and more substantial than forecast. Government can afford to be pleasantly surprised at the pace of the recovery and the growth in employment. Nonetheless, the vaccine program is still building momentum and state leaders have shown themselves prepared to impose snap lockdowns. With winter approaching there is no room for complacency. Despite a better-than-expected recovery in activity, Australia has been left with a significantly increased debt burden that must be addressed before global interest rates return to more normal levels.
Businesses are laying out the precarious nature of their position in arguments regarding the minimum wage decision due in June. As Ewin Hannan reports on Tuesday, the National Farmers Federation has called for a freeze in minimum and award wages for low-paid workers until conditions improve. In a submission to the Fair Work Commission’s annual wage review, the NFF says farms are facing adverse conditions that threaten business sustainability and productivity. Business NSW has urged the commission to award a zero increase this year and the Morrison government has warned increasing the minimum wage could be a “constraint to small business recovery” and cost jobs. Unions are urging the commission to back a 3.5 per cent minimum wage increase, saying a failure to boost the pay packets of workers “threatens the entire recovery”.
Arguments over the minimum wage reflect sharp divisions over how governments around the world should respond to the increased debt and lower economic activity because of the pandemic. One way is for governments to work hard to build the economy by improving productivity and streamlining regulation to remove blocks to employment and enterprise. An alternative is slug taxpayers with additional imposts and justify the hit because of the exceptional nature of the pandemic and the support it has created for greater government intervention. Not surprisingly, this route is favoured by many on the left of politics and in the public sector, despite showing itself to be electorally unsuccessful in recent elections in Britain and Australia. The International Monetary Fund is advocating extended job subsidies and a new wave of government imposts, including increased property taxes, death duties and special-purpose levies for high-income earners. The IMF also has floated the idea of a super-profits tax for companies that are able to earn more than authorities might deem appropriate. The IMF says the pandemic has focused public attention on governments and their ability to respond to the crisis. It says meeting the rising demand for basic public services and more inclusive policies is crucial for policymakers to strengthen public trust and support social cohesion. The federal government must be wary of these proscriptions and instead favour policies that enhance productivity and grow the economy. The World Economic Outlook report, to be released on Tuesday, is expected to illustrate how well Australia has fared compared with other parts of the world. As Josh Frydenberg prepares the federal budget due to be delivered on May 11, the focus should be on sticking with reforms to lessen the tax burden through changes to personal taxation rates that have already been legislated and progressively reducing the level of government intervention made necessary by the pandemic.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
COMMENT Easter’s not as usual but nothing is	Wanganui Chronicle	Happy Easter, everyone!
Okay, so it’s not the Easter break many of us would have chosen.
We won’t be heading out on the highway to our holiday homes or campsites for a last break away before winter sets in. We won’t be hitting the beach for a swim or a surf, we won’t be heading for the hills to go tramping and we won’t be going bush for some hunting with our mates. We won’t even be going to church.
On the bright side, we haven’t had to plan, organise or pay for a getaway. We won’t be sitting in traffic queues for hours at each end of the long weekend, and there won’t be the heartbreaking reality of the annual Easter road toll to deal with for some.
There is no doubt there will be hardship and loneliness and despair, however — particularly for some of those living alone, those living in violent homes and relationships, those dealing with poverty and those living on the street or in other difficult circumstances. There is, of course, ongoing anxiety and uncertainty for many of us, regarding our health, homes, businesses, jobs and livelihoods. Some are already grieving the loss of work. And a handful of New Zealand families are facing the ultimate grief and fear as the virus takes a far more personal toll.
But this Easter, many of us are still able to spend time with friends and family — albeit it in our lockdown bubbles — and enjoy the usual hot cross buns and chocolate treats.
It is, perhaps, a chance to take stock and be grateful for what we do have. An opportunity for us all — believers or not — to reflect on the true meaning of Easter, on the nature of sacrifice, rebirth and salvation, which seem particularly poignant as we pass the halfway point of lockdown and begin to consider what life may look like on the other side of it.
So, as well as re-evaluating our personal circumstances, and setting the world to rights as armchair critics, just what activities can we do and where can we go this Easter lockdown weekend?
Although Health Minister David Clark has been left with more than just Easter egg on his face after his interpretation of the exercise and travel rules, and National leader Simon Bridges’ defence of his 500km essential-worker commutes between Wellington and Tauranga is debatable, the messages for Easter in lockdown remain exactly the same as they have been throughout from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield. That is “stay home”. And, if you must go out to provide or use essential services or get some exercise, “stay local”.
Police have been focused on education and encouragement but they are now moving into a clear enforcement phase and clamping down on lockdown transgressors, as evidenced by the fact the number of arrests is slowly but surely rising. Police will also be manning checkpoints to prevent people heading away to holiday hotspots.
All of Government Controller John Ombler has said, on several occasions since the lockdown was announced, that if people are trying to find ways to get around the rules, and not playing the game, they are not taking the pandemic seriously enough and are putting other New Zealanders’ lives at risk.
Remember, every time you leave the house — even under the exceptions, you put yourself and essential workers at risk. The whole purpose of the alert level 4 lockdown is to minimise that risk.
So, when it comes to Easter activities, not only should we adhere to the letter of the law but we need to also follow the spirit of the rules, the entire purpose of which are to protect us all.
When it comes to exercise, while cycling and scootering are allowed, be careful out there folks. And maybe just take a brisk walk around the block instead. Get the kids to look out for the latest neighbourhood attraction as part of The Big New Zealand Easter Hunt.
If you want to do some DIY, ask yourself if it really has to be done this weekend or in the next two weeks. The very last thing emergency services and health professionals need right now is being put at risk of infection and clogging up vital hospital beds with people who have injured themselves falling off the roof while waterblasting, electrocuting themselves while drilling, or cutting themselves on the chainsaw ... Okay, it’s no picnic, but neither’s the alternative.
Anyone doubting that should take pause and read up about the terrifying impact of the virus in the UK, New York, Italy or Spain. What we are all doing appears to be working. But we need to keep doing it until the coast is clear.
And remember, this Easter, like the rest of lockdown, we don’t have to lose weight, write a bestselling novel, reclad the entire house, or homeschool our 5-year-olds to scholarship level. We have one job to do: stay put and not infect anyone, while being kind to ourselves and others.
So go on, have that extra Easter egg, you deserve it, New Zealand!	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
COMMENT Happy New Year - and good luck to us all!	The Northern Advocate	Happy New Year! As in really sort of like reasonably or fairly happy new year in an average sense. Personal circumstances may vary — you might have woken up to 2020 in love, on a warm coast surrounded by family, or alone, anxious, afraid, hoping there was something worthwhile to watch on TV — but the general mood is that 2020 hasn’t been welcomed in with the requisite hilarity and optimism of all New Years.
Something is missing. Something is casting a shadow. New Zealand, first to see the dawn of the new decade; but the light is murky, done out in weird shades of orange and red, brought on by the Australian bush fires.
The scientific term for it is cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs), meaning the hazy skies caused by smoke across the Tasman Sea.
This isn’t global warming. That sounds too laid back, too passive. This is more like global heating. This is the future, a helter skelter coming down fast. With each year we’re drawing closer and closer to some kind of climate change chaos, and the Australian bush fires act to put a siren on it.
Nuclear war was the very real and very terrifying threat the world had to put up with during the long, tense years of the Cold War. The next big fear was post 9/11, and the way Bush’s US administration worked fast to put out the fires of an Islamic extremist uprising with the gasoline of its foreign policy. It feels almost nostalgic that we were afraid of ideology, religious mania and the killing machines operated by Pax Americana.
Global warming and climate change is the revenge of the most powerful force in the world: the planet. How do you fight that? What hope is there?
Happy New Year and good luck to us all.
When the going gets tough, I often wonder how Swami Nithyananda is getting on. This guy decided to set up his country, the Republic of Kailaasa, on an island near Ecuador. He claims he can see through walls. He claims he has cured 82 children of blindness. He claims he can communicate with cows. Okay, so he sounds like a silly old moo, but maybe he’s got the right idea. Strike another match, go start anew. His own country, his own nirvana, somewhere remote, peaceful. Somewhere to see in the new year without a care in the world about what happens to the rest of the world. — NZME

EDITORIAL Disrupted year for students	Bay of Plenty Times	Hard to believe, I know, but school’s out already from the end of tomorrow.
It has been a disrupted year for our students but local principals are saying the vast majority of students have shown exceptional adaptability and resilience.
“I wish to congratulate them for their generally positive response to this lifetime defining experience,” says Whangamata Area School principal Alistair Luke.
“We look forward to a refreshing break and a sense of structure and normality returning in term 3.”
This week’s paper shows how youngsters in our communities are giving back, and shining.
And lockdown gave many of us parents an appreciation for the work that teachers do.
Most teachers choose their career because they care about our young people and our future.
And the appreciation is obvious.
This week Tairua School said goodbye to its longtime principal Brendon Finn and teacher Chris Hogarth, who were sent off with a moving powhiri, and in the case of Chris Hogarth, a heartfelt song written and sung by students, who then gave him the guitar.
Thankfully we always seem to find great people willing to step into our community leadership roles, bringing fresh perspective and enthusiasm.
Pick up next week’s paper for some school holiday activity ideas.

Pandemic politics raises the temperature of debate	The Australian	Hardline stances of some premiers are taking a deadly toll The politics of COVID-19 is sapping goodwill from the pandemic response and forcing the Morrison government to fight back or remain stranded by decisions taken beyond its control. Risk-averse premiers have been wreaking havoc on the economic and emotional lives of citizens and sheeting home the blame to Canberra. Newspoll results show the premiers’ actions are starting to damage Scott Morrison’s political fortunes.
As a result, the temperature of the pandemic debate has risen inside federal parliament and on the street. The tragic death of an unborn child after a NSW woman was denied access to a Queensland hospital has served to underscore the gravity of what is at stake. It has uncovered further tales of medical heartbreak resulting from border closures and forced the start of a concession from what has been a hard line by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk.
Victoria’s Daniel Andrews, meanwhile, finally has started to talk about a road map out of lockdown. But after days of dithering the best he has been able to do is announce a plan to make a plan that will be detailed next week. The Victorian Premier’s shift on Monday followed bad news from Australian Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth that he could not see Melbourne’s stage-four lockdowns ending by its September 13 deadline. That’s disappointing. But calls for a road map out, including from this newspaper, have always been about the need for hope and guidance that there will be a clear set of markers for how things will get back to normal, not what the date will be.
Small though it is, Monday’s shift by Mr Andrews offers a positive message for residents of Australia’s second-most populous city, where many remain under effective house arrest for 23 hours a day. When they are allowed out, one at a time, Melburnians must wear a mask and may not stray more than 5km from home. Victoria’s change in tack came after a weekend of prevarication by the Premier.
Mr Andrews finally came around after strong words from Josh Frydenberg, who is at the coal face of having to frame a budget. The view of the federal Treasurer, a Melbourne resident, is that there has been too much confusion, too much cruelty and not enough compassion and common sense. Financially, while other states are returning to normal levels of spending and employment, Victoria’s vital signs are back to where others were at the depths of the pandemic. Figures released on Monday show almost 870,000 Victorians — about 17 per cent of the state’s adult population — with a job but working zero hours in mid-August.
Mr Andrews now says he will release a road map to normalcy on Sunday after consultation with business and unions. There will be different requirements for different industries in what Mr Andrews says will be planning for a COVID normal. Mr Andrews’s response looks like an exercise in buying time but it is nonetheless a step in the right direction.
Queensland, meanwhile, is setting up a special unit to have a look at the hardship cases in northern NSW where people with urgent medical needs have been unable to access specialist care across the border. Establishing this unit is confirmation that Queensland’s border policy was done on the run.
It is normal that citizens will place their trust in leaders during times of uncertainty. Premiers have a responsibility not to exploit that. It is cynical for state leaders to shut borders, to keep people locked down and to seek to profit politically from their fears. Greater transparency is the much-needed antidote. This includes clear guidelines on what actions are being planned and what measures will trigger a return to normal.
Greater transparency also is needed on who is most at risk of becoming a COVID victim. People are entitled to have more detail on what the circumstances are for people who are dying because of the pandemic. This is not to downplay the seriousness of the virus or to dismiss the tragic nature of the deaths. But it is essential to identify who are the most vulnerable and to get greater clarity about the role of other chronic illnesses. On many of these measures, NSW has shown the way ahead. After early missteps with the Ruby Princess, the NSW government has been the model on how best to respond to the challenges posed by the pandemic. Despite some early oversteps by the police, citizens have been allowed to move freely and in response have been mature in their adoption of social distancing and other measures. The health bureaucracy in NSW appears to be well able to get on top of contact tracing and suppression when breakouts do occur. The economic figures show that citizens are getting on with their lives and that the busiest city in Australia is still in business. NSW puts Victoria and Queensland to shame. The experience in Victoria demonstrates that the authoritarian tendencies of the left do not lead to better outcomes or sensible behaviour.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
EDITORIAL Northern Link: Who deserves the most credit?	Bay of Plenty Times	Has any project ever had so many people rushing to claim credit than the Tauranga Northern Link?
The project, also known as the Tauranga Northern Arterial, has been discussed since the 1990s and was designated in 2001.
The Government on Wednesday finally agreed to provide $478 million to build the whole four-lanes deal — plus bonus cycle lanes and footpaths.
This was an improvement on the two-lane plus maybe-if-you’re-lucky T3 lane consolation prize it promised in 2018.
Wednesday’s announcement was followed by a flurry of political back-patting.
Labour MPs claimed kudos for getting the funding over the line and promised to deliver the road while also glossing over the 2 years spent faffing about with assessments.
National said it was its idea first and — even though it didn’t get a single spade in the ground for this project in nine years of governing — if we actually want the road delivered New Zealand has to re-elect National.
A New Zealand First MP claimed it was all the result of the party’s hard work in not letting its coalition partners forget this suddenly essential piece of infrastructure.
Watching the comments roll in, it became apparent to me that someone needed to settle the most important question in all of this: Who deserves the most credit?
I’ve decided to hand the biggest slice of the credit pie not to crowing MPs, but to the Western Bay of Plenty District Council and especially to the long-suffering ratepayers and taxpaying residents in the district’s north.
Their hopes been lifted and crushed, lifted and crushed, on the whims of successive slow-moving governments.
They’ve mourned people lost on an unforgiving stretch of highway and lamented the ever-longer hours of the day they spent sitting, seething, in traffic with no alternative.
The council, meanwhile, earnestly held up its end of the bargain, making way for much-needed housing developments in Ōmokoroa and beyond, as central government-led transport upgrade projects languished.
Garry Webber — Ōmokoroa resident, councillor since 2010, and mayor since 2016 — deserves a particular nod for his relentless quiet diplomacy in recent years.
Let’s hope he has some patience in reserve because I’m willing to bet that, in an election year, we’re going to have to endure more political point-scoring before anyone actually builds this road — albeit 10 years too late.

EDITORIAL Labour’s power to rule needs wisdom	Hawkes Bay Today	Hawke’s Bay is now a red bay.
With a region split down the middle (two Labour and two National seats) going into Saturday night, a Split Enz special ensued.
Anna Lorck knocked over National’s Lawrence Yule in Tukituki. Meka Whaitiri got her vindication with a crushing win in Ikaroa-Rawhiti. Stuart Nash kept his majority in Napier. And Kieran McAnulty stormed home in Wairarapa, an electorate that includes Dannevirke, Waipawa and Waipukurau. The Labour dominance extended north, with Kiri Allan taking East Coast.
The result is one for the books, for Lorck in particular. She gambled everything on Tukituki, running a relentless street corner-style campaign.
She refused to take any form of list spot and in doing so not-so-subtly hinted that she was in politics only for the people of Tukituki, rather than the free lunches.
Yule’s campaign on the other hand focused on National promises that he’d worked hard to seal for his electorate.
It made for good headlines — who wouldn’t love a huge $500m rebuild of Hawke’s Bay Hospital? — but because of the rabble that his party had become, they were promises very unlikely to ever be delivered.
The relationship between the pair, if there ever was one, had clearly disintegrated by the end of the campaign, and the last few weeks descended into some politically petty moments on both sides as they fought for every last vote.
Ultimately, Hawke’s Bay’s turn to Labour can be put down to Jacinda Ardern’s incredible popularity, gained through her constant displays of competence and compassion, in three years of history that New Zealand is unlikely to ever forget.
McAnulty, Whaitiri, Lorck and Nash have all been boosted by the Jacinda effect.
Now it’s time for them to do great things for Hawke’s Bay. They have the biggest mandate to make changes, to fix what is broken, to not compromise on what matters to the people of this region for the sake of votes, in modern NZ’s political history.
Labour has been given the power to rule, but it’ll have to do so wisely. Immediate issues need addressing — housing woes, water allocation, and picking the fruit this summer are among them.
If the region struggles to recover from its Covid hangover, or if the ever-present possibility of the disease sneaking in again comes to reality, there is hope among the destruction for National.
Tukituki will flip in a heartbeat if all’s not well in camp Labour. And Katie Nimon, who was closer than most would have predicted in Napier given the big party vote swing to Labour, will be snapping at Nash’s heels in 2023.
On Saturday night, Labour turned red. Now the hard work begins.

In flooding rains, it’s time to tackle bushfire threats	The Australian	Hazard reduction burns are important to reduce the risks Amid a changing climate that leaves the nation at greater risk of deadly bushfires, governments, local authorities and landholders should heed the advice of the independent NSW inquiry investigating the catastrophic Black Summer bushfires. Over a scorching spring and summer Australians will never forget, fires killed 34 people, destroyed more than 3000 homes and burnt out 12 million hectares of land across the continent from October 2019 to February this year. One of the most important recommendations of the report, Yoni Bashan revealed on Saturday’s front page, was that hazard reduction burns should be greatly increased, better targeted and take place closer to vulnerable towns and communities, not kilometres away. The 450-page report, by former NSW Police deputy commissioner Dave Owens and former NSW chief scientist Mary O’Kane, has been handed to the Berejiklian government but is yet to be discussed by cabinet. It is expected to be released, along with the government’s response, by the end of this month.
One of a number of the 76 recommendations obtained by The Weekend Australian was that NSW invest in long-term modelling and forecasts of climate extremes, as well as studies to track the effects of droughts on the intensity and frequency of bushfires. That research would consider the links between fires, drought and “hydrological” changes (the amount of freshwater on and in the ground, determined by geology, land use, climate and management of water resources). Because of changing climate conditions, water conservation efforts might need to be enacted further south than previously considered necessary.
At a time when families in southern NSW who lost their homes in the fires are battling floodwaters and attention is centred on COVID-19, it would be easy to overlook investing in bushfire hazard reduction. That would be a grave error. When inquiry reports into natural disasters appear, governments often promise to implement them in full. Long-term, however, action can fall far short of the promises. For example, in January we reported that hazard reduction burns in Victoria over the past three years combined had fallen short of the level recommended for a single year by the Black Saturday royal commission in 2010. Controlled burns had returned to pre-Black Saturday levels of just 130,000ha a year — only a third of the 385,000ha recommended by the royal commission in 2010.
No state can afford such risks. The coming spring and summer may be benign in terms of bushfires. But abundant rains will bring vast undergrowth to cover the scorched earth ravaged last summer. At some time, possibly within a couple of years, tinderbox conditions will again prevail. The NSW Rural Fire Service, wisely, has already urged residents in six areas — Armidale, Walcha, Uralla, Glen Innes Severn, Inverell and Tenterfield — to begin fire safety preparations.
The recommendation to ­increase land clearing and step up hazard reduction burns will be controversial. The Greens, many in the Labor opposition and some in the Coalition will want to focus on the heightened bushfire risk wrought by climate change. In a time of climate change, land clearing, while not a panacea, is an essential and readily achievable aspect of bushfire hazard reduction. Over the longer term, The Australian has long believed that if a sustainable transition to lower and ultimately zero emissions is to be achieved, market efficiencies will get us there for the least cost. For the sake of the communities whose lives and livelihoods are at stake, debates about mitigating bushfire risks need to be based on facts, not prejudice and hype. Last summer showed how grave a danger excessive fuel loads can be. The NSW report, implemented well, should help lessen the dangers.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Biden hovers as the world awaits election outcome	The Australian	Healing the deep divisions in US society would be a big ask Joe Biden’s mantra that there will be neither red states nor blue states, just one United States, should he emerge as victor from the knife-edge presidential election, rolls off the tongue easily. But it would be a lot for him to live up to in the event he is inaugurated in January as the 46th US president. His nation’s deep divisions are crying out for healing. But there is little in his long political career or his insipid, confused campaign to inspire confidence that he could deliver on that ambitious vision.
If the former vice-president secures a narrow win after counting and legal action by the Trump camp are resolved, Mr Biden will need to recognise the legitimate concerns of tens of millions of Americans who embraced Donald Trump. For all his unorthodox, abrasive qualities, Mr Trump appeals to millions of patriotic, hardworking Americans who watched as their values were denigrated, their jobs exported and their country’s history and ideals sneered at by some of its privileged, high-profile citizens. In Mr Trump they found someone with a loud voice who expressed their fears and frustrations. This newspaper always recognised the President’s flaws. He is intemperate, volatile, impatient and provocative. But his promise to “drain the swamp” inside the Washington Beltway particularly resonated among working-class suburban and rural voters across the US. Such citizens have felt increasingly excluded and estranged by an entrenched ruling elite and most of the mainstream media. Not only are many US newspapers and broadcasters out of touch with grassroots concerns about jobs, power prices and the cancel culture encroaching on education, most of the media have shown no interest in such matters. Mr Trump can draw satisfaction at having inspired millions of disenfranchised Americans to re-engage with their political system.
A potential flashpoint reared its head on Thursday, Australian time. The US formally left the Paris Agreement in accord with the 12 months’ notice Mr Trump gave a year ago. Mr Biden tweeted that he would rejoin the agreement on his first day in office. The Australian supports the agreement as a means to bring about action by all nations, including the heaviest greenhouse gas emitting industrial powerhouses, against global warming. At the same time, Mr Biden’s pledge to “transition from the oil industry” is potentially problematic for many in red and blue states. His goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 is highly ambitious. Much will depend on technological advances. But fracking has freed the US from dependence on imported energy. It boosted prosperity in oil states such as Pennsylvania and Texas. Even house Democrats in oil-producing states Oklahoma and New Mexico were quick to distance themselves from Mr Biden’s remarks on oil during the second debate.
When the presidential election and the make-up of congress is settled, political attention in the US must switch to containing the coronavirus pandemic and to economic rebuilding. The world, including Australia, needs the largest economy to fire and regain strength. The US falling into prolonged recession or, worse, a depression would drag down much of the world with it, especially as Europe continues battling the ravages of COVID-19. After taking a heavy hit earlier in the year, US gross domestic product surged by a record 33 per cent last quarter. The White House administration and congress must prioritise promoting confidence, investment, production, spending, exports and jobs growth. In this environment, Mr Biden’s plans to increase corporate taxes from 21 per cent to 28 per cent and payroll taxes would risk creating disincentives. US voters have hedged their bets. If Mr Biden sought to impose hard-left, high-taxing policies and over-regulation of business, the Republican-dominated Senate would be well placed to keep him in check. On the culture wars and social issues, the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, one of Mr Trump’s enduring legacies, should help prevent the US straying too far from mainstream values. The court is now beyond the reach of ideologues who aspired to stack it with liberals.
Law and order will be a prime concern of many Americans in the coming term. The issue also will be watched by the rest of the world. Despite support among far-left Democrats for the ridiculous notion of defunding the police, a Biden administration would need to act to reassure mainstream Americans that their safety was a priority. The new president would need to plant his standard firmly in the centre and unconditionally reject the mob rule that has been allowed to take root in Democratic strongholds such as Portland, Oregon. Unity without personal safety is a hollow promise. Violence in the streets must end, regardless of what grievance it purports to represent.
Foreign policy gained scant attention in the campaign. But Mr Biden carries much baggage from the erosion of US authority during the Obama years. Facing an emboldened China and resurgent religious wars in Europe, he would need shrewdness and steel. Mr Trump’s progress in Middle East peace deals between Arab states and Israel must be built on. But before such issues are explored, claims that Democratic machines in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania sought to steal the election late on the first day of counting, when things were not going their way, must be dealt with thoroughly and transparently, and must be resolved. The challenges facing any president are momentous. Any lingering doubts about his legitimacy would destabilise the US and be bad for the world.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Keep calm and make a curry	The Australian	Health news inevitably will get worse before it gets better
On Thursday Scott Morrison explained that every Australian had a responsible role to play in the evolving coronavirus outbreak. The coming months will test our resolve and the Prime Minister urged common sense. Medical officials, although reluctant to release such information, have modelled best and worst-case health scenarios. At the top end, according to Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy, it’s “some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks”. Health authorities have a pandemic game plan that is being rolled out as events demand. Travel bans, in place for China and Iran, were extended to South Korea on Thursday; travellers from Italy now would be subjected to enhanced screening. These moves, of course, merely will delay the inevitable. Bad news will accumulate and the disruption to normal life will intensify.
But the combination of containment action and time, aided by geography, has given officials a chance to prepare. Mr Morrison and Dr Murphy maintain people should go about their business, unless they are experiencing flu-like symptoms; in that case, they should isolate themselves. Most people are listening and some 10,000 people have already been tested. Still, there is often little that can be said to dissuade the herd. The run on toilet paper prompted Dr Murphy to reiterate there was “no need to denude the shelves of lavatory paper in the supermarket”.
So far, the Morrison government has deftly handled its messaging, which has been a template for state governments. Health Minister Greg Hunt described the approach to information releases as “transparent, early and frequent”. They will be held to these sound principles as the COVID-19 contagion spreads. The government is battling a trust deficit, especially after the bushfires crisis, but also evidenced by the panic buying of supplies. As we said last Saturday, social bonds are being tested by the epidemic. On Thursday, Mr Morrison spoke about the isolation many people would soon face, especially in rural areas, without access to food home delivery services. “Make them a curry and take it around if they need one,” he advised.
Nations now are scrambling to limit health risks. At face value it appears the daily number of new cases in China may have peaked. Iran, Italy and South Korea are the epicentres of infections. Schools have closed in Italy, workers are being advised to stay home and public events are being cancelled. In NSW, human-to-human transmission is gathering pace, with Health Minister Brad Hazzard declaring it a “war against coronavirus”. After an outbreak at a Sydney aged-care facility, where a resident died and three others were infected, workers collectively called in sick. Damned if they work, damned if they don’t; these dilemmas and snap actions will become the norm, with state medical workers called in to help the aged. On Thursday we reported a row between Canberra and NSW over emergency funding. Mr Morrison confirmed costs would be shared.
With person-to-person transmission here six weeks ahead of initial forecasts, emergency infrastructure is being put in place. In Queensland, authorities said the state’s contingency planning assumed at least 25 per cent of the population would be infected in the “first wave”. But the state’s Chief Health Officer, Jeannette Young, said advance planning meant infection rates would likely be lower than in China, which was in the middle of an outbreak before they even knew they had it.This week we’ve considered in this space the likely economic blowback, ahead of the Morrison government’s targeted fiscal package. The damage to the budget and national output could be substantial. But COVID-19 is mainly a health crisis. Workplaces, schools, shops and events will be disrupted; labs, hospitals, GP clinics, pharmacies and aged-care homes will experience severe strains. Infection numbers will zoom up in geometric progression. Normal programming could be months away. This will test our national equanimity as much as medical systems, leadership and economic resilience. Through the years, Australians have been strong in a crisis — war, bushfire, flood, cyclone, epidemic and economic shock. To draw on one of Mr Morrison’s usages, we will soon find out just how good is Australia.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Keep Diggers’ killer behind bars	The Australian	Hekmatullah was a treacherous, cold-blooded murderer Injustice will be the winner if Kabul authorities, at the behest of the Trump administration, release the former Afghan soldier who killed three Diggers deployed to defend the country against terrorism. The turncoat, known as Hekmatullah, is among 400 prisoners whose freedom the Taliban has demanded as a precondition for doing the peace deal Donald Trump wants in place before November’s US election. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has conceded releasing the prisoners “is unpopular”. He claims doing so will lead to an agreement that will end the war. Scott Morrison has urged Mr Trump to keep Hekmatullah behind bars. As the Prime Minister says, he should never be released.
Even if Mr Pompeo’s confidence turns out to be well-founded, and there is no certainty, it would be an egregious error to compel Kabul to release Hekmatullah. Worse than even the Taliban, he was a treacherous so-called “green-on-blue” killer who feigned loyalty and pretended to be an Afghan soldier, then turned on our Diggers serving in a tough and inhospitable theatre of war. Those he murdered in a cold-blooded act at a forward operating base north of Australia’s main base at Tarin Kowt on August 29, 2012 were Private Robert Poate, 23; Lance Corporal Stjepan “Rick” Milosevic, 40; and Sapper James Martin, 21. The Australians were playing cards at the time. Hekmatullah also wounded two other Australians. The attack led to a six-month manhunt involving elite Australian special forces and cutting-edge technology before Hekmatullah was seized in the Pakistani city of Quetta, home of Taliban leaders.
He avoided execution despite being handed a death sentence by the Afghan Supreme Court in 2013. Since then, he has been in a Kabul prison. As Ben Packham reported on Monday, Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds have been “frantically lobbying” Afghan officials to keep him there and to not allow themselves to be cajoled into releasing him. He could be released in the next few days. It would be unfortunate if Mr Pompeo and the authorities in Kabul failed to understand the revulsion Australians felt about that prospect. The families of the three men spoke of a “crushing blow” after being given news of Hekmatullah’s likely release: “There can never be complete closure for us now.” Australians identify with those deeply felt sentiments. During the past 17 years our servicemen and women have sacrificed much to help Afghanistan. Their efforts deserve better than to see a villain such as Hekmatullah walk free for the sake of a precipitous, uncertain peace deal that at worst could help the Taliban in re-establishing its rule in Kabul. Other members of the NATO-led coalition that fought in Afghanistan also are seeking to exempt killers of their soldiers from the prisoner release. The US needs to heed the outrage of those appalled by the thought of a murderer such as Hekmatullah going free.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Indecent haste on Taliban deal	The Australian	Hekmatullah, who killed three Diggers, should not be freed The arrival in Doha of 21 Taliban negotiators is the strongest signal yet of Donald Trump’s determination to have a peace deal with the Islamist terrorists in place before the November 3 US election. But it will be unfortunate if it means strenuous Australian and French objections to the release of high-profile Taliban prisoners are brushed aside by Washington in its rush to conclude the matter.
As Ben Packham reported on Saturday, Hekmatullah, the turncoat former Afghan National Army sergeant who, in a so-called “green on blue” insider killing, emptied his entire M16 ammunition clip into a group of Diggers while they were relaxing at Tarin Kowt in August 2012, murdering three and wounding others, is being “relocated” from Kabul to Doha. That move suggests his release may be imminent, despite Scott Morrison’s insistence that Hekmatullah should never be freed after an Afghan court imposed a life sentence on him. It also suggests entreaties by Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds to their US counterparts have fallen on deaf ears.
The families of the Diggers — Private Robert Poate, Lance Corporal Stjepan “Rick” Milosevic and Sapper James Martin — are rightly appalled that Hekmatullah is among 5000 fighters the Taliban want handed over before they agree to the US-sponsored peace deal. Australia is not alone in its dismay. French President Emmanuel Macron is outraged over the idea of freedom for Taliban terrorists who killed French soldiers and aid workers. Those on the list include the killers of Bettina Goislard, a French UN aid worker shot at point-blank range by the Taliban in 2003. Ms Goislard’s family described news of her killers’ probable release as “like a slap across the face”. Her sister, Julie, said: “The memory of the victims is being trampled on for the sake of an agreement. We feel horribly alone since we got this news.” Some 140 US-led coalition troops were killed in 85 “insider” attacks in Afghanistan. Three Taliban fighters linked to such attacks are among those up for release. In its eagerness to clinch a deal that will allow Mr Trump to claim he has ended US involvement in its longest so-called “unwinnable” war, Washington has not publicly objected to their release. Mr Trump’s anxiety to fulfil his 2016 election pledge to bring US troops home from such wars is understandable. But disregarding the dismay of close allies such as Australia and France is a high price to pay. On Sunday, the US chief negotiator, Afghan-born Zalmay Khalilzad, was on his way to Doha to meet a Taliban team led by the terrorist group’s “chief justice”, Mawlavi Abdul Hakim, a hardline Islamic cleric who, like all the Taliban leadership, would like to see Afghanistan revert to the obscurantist state it was before 9/11. Washington, as progenitor of the Afghan peace process, should ensure the Taliban do not get their way. Freedom for killers such as Hekmatullah would be a travesty.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
EDITORIAL Weekender goes ‘on pause’	The Daily Post	Hello readers. The past week has been unsettling and stressful at times as our Government made the directive for our country to move to a Level 4 Covid-19 lockdown period.
This unprecedented move has meant a number of businesses have had to close or do things differently.
Here at the Rotorua Weekender, we’ve also been doing things differently, as we have worked to bring you positive community stories in a safe way.
However, we’ve also felt the impact of Covid-19, and as a result we will be pausing publication of the Weekender until further notice.
This has been a difficult decision for us but I am sure you will understand.
While we are pausing the Weekender we will be focusing all of our attention on the Rotorua Daily Post so that we can keep you up to date with local and national news and information. We appreciate your support.
You can visit rotoruadailypost.co.nz or subscribe to have the daily newspaper delivered.
If you hear of anything interesting or important during the lockdown please do not hesitate to get in touch with us by emailing news@dailypost.co.nz.
There will be a lot of emotions and feelings to be experienced as we navigate this new temporary normal, and remember it is very natural to feel this way.
Here are a few of my survival tips to help my mental and physical health during this time.
■ 1. Take time to slow down. Children’s school work can wait — make memories with your children so they feel safe and loved.
■ 2. Email, write a letter, make a card, phone or video call a friend, family member or elderly friend or neighbour. We will all be experiencing similar emotions so it is vital to share conversations with people we care about.
■ 3. Go outside. You can still walk or exercise with the family or household members. Physical exercise and fresh air will do wonders for how you are feeling.
■ 4. Be creative in whatever form you wish. Draw, paint, write, create, take photographs.
■ 5. Try to stick to a routine, make your bed, get dressed and eat regular meals.
■ 6. Don’t panic and try to use up food before racing out to get more. There is enough for everyone if we do not panic.
■ 7. Wash your hands well and try to stay positive.
■ 8. Make new traditions and things to look forward to. Plan things that you would like to do once we return to normal.
Keep safe, be kind and caring in your communication with each other.
Arohanui,
Jane

Five-year-old’s welfare top priority	The Australian	Her safety and care must be monitored closely after earlier trauma Only one factor should determine where and with whom a five-year-old girl who was raped in Tennant Creek three years ago lives now. That is, her wellbeing. Northern Territory child protection authorities say the child is now thriving, living with her mother in a remote community, with no permanent police presence, more than 300km from any major centre. It is reportedly a “dry’’ community with strong local leadership. NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner is satisfied with the girl’s living arrangements and with the support and monitoring in place to ensure she remains safe. But others disagree.
Alice Springs deputy mayor Jacinta Nampijinpa Price said that returning the girl to her mother just months after the rape “doesn’t stack up”. If opportunists were around, they would take advantage of such circumstances, Ms Price says. In her view, “there’s no such thing as a dry community and perpetrators don’t necessarily need alcohol’’. Territory authorities were more concerned about reuniting families than vulnerable children’s rights: “Ultimately, it’s race-based discrimination against children because they’re Indigenous.” After the rape, in February 2018, the girl underwent surgery for genital injuries, had a blood transfusion and tested positive for gonorrhoea. She was suffering from ear infections, head lice, ringworm and skin sores. The NT Children’s Commissioner found the girl and her siblings had been the subject of 52 notifications to child protection agencies since 2002. These related to domestic violence and parental substance abuse, truancy, neglect, emotional harm, physical harm and sexual abuse.
Last year, Kingsley Corbett, 27, was jailed for the rape. The court heard he had sneaked in during the night and snatched her from her mother’s side before raping her in an adjacent room. The girl’s mother, who told police she had been drinking and watching TV before going to sleep, did not notice.
On the positive side, Territory Families chief executive Jeanette Kerr says TF had implemented a safety plan with monitoring and support, and provided a house. The family was doing “exceptionally well’’, and no concerns had been reported in 2½ years. The family had all the amenities needed, the mother was nurturing and the child was doing well, Ms Kerr said. The department visits the community about once a month. The mother, 39, told The Australian the family had moved on, was living a “good life’’ and not “going backwards’’. Be that as it may, for the sake of the child and her siblings, close monitoring remains vital.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Beirut’s enduring misfortunes	The Australian	Hezbollah terrorists are running Lebanon into the ground There is much speculation but not yet any real certainty about the cause of the apocalyptic explosions that devastated vast areas of Beirut, killing at least 100 people, including one Australian, and injuring more than 4000 others. But as investigations get under way into what Donald Trump termed a “terrible attack” caused by “a bomb of some kind”, it would be impossible not to sympathise with one of the survivors, a Lebanese man in his early 20s who, with blood pouring from wounds, cried: “We’re cursed … even if this was an accident, it’s the last thing we could afford.” His anguish was well founded. All too often Lebanon, a country many Australians know through the diaspora of 230,000 among us, does indeed seem “cursed”. Beirut Governor Marwan Aboud called the explosions, centred on a warehouse at Beirut’s port, “a national disaster akin to Hiroshima”.
The blasts, which Germany’s Geosciences Centre GFZ reported struck with the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake and were heard as far away as Cyprus, follow months of upheavals that have left Lebanon’s economy in desperate straits. Under-equipped and overworked hospitals are struggling to cope with rising COVID-19 infections. A broken power system is barely able to supply electricity for more than a few hours a day. Basic services such as garbage collection are non-existent. Food is in short supply. Scott Morrison struck the right note when he spoke of Australia’s sincere “sympathies to all the people of Lebanon”. The country deserves far better. But it is unlikely to get it unless it learns the hard lessons that have brought it to its present sorry pass. Its collapse into ungoverned chaos owes much to decades of misguided and corrupt rule. Largely it is due to its failure to get to grips with the threat posed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists, whose leaders effectively run Lebanon, wielding decisive influence. Lebanese officials say Tuesday’s devastation was caused by a stockpile of 2700 tonnes of explosive ammonium nitrate at the port. That may be so. But it also raises serious questions about Hezbollah. The port, like much of Lebanon, is acknowledged to be under the firm control of the anti-Israel terrorists. Hezbollah has been known in the past to store at the port large caches of weapons, including lethal Iranian-supplied missiles destined to attack Israel. Inevitably, the immediate speculation was that Israel might have detonated the ammonium nitrate stockpile. News agency reports claimed Israeli aircraft and drones recently had been flying “with increasing regularity” over Beirut after a thwarted Hezbollah attempt last week to send terrorists into the Jewish state. Officials in Jerusalem emphatically denied the reports, despite known Israeli involvement in recent covert attacks in Iran and against Hezbollah bases in Iraq. Beirut’s tragic devastation is a reminder that allowing Hezbollah’s army to base itself in Lebanon and dominate the country lies at the heart of its problems. Its misfortunes and the misery of its people are unlikely to change until its leaders start acting in Lebanon’s interests.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Remaking our honours system	The Australian	High-flyers are getting gongs simply for doing their day jobs Spare a thought for James Edelman, the newest judge of the High Court of Australia. The other six justices have been appointed as Companion of the Order of Australia, the top tier in our honours system, awarded “for eminent achievement and merit of the highest degree in service to Australia or humanity at large”. No doubt Justice Edelman, appointed in 2017, will join their distinguished ranks before he is required to retire in 2044. It goes with the territory. Likewise for former prime ministers, although Paul Keating is the only national leader to have rejected the honour. Kevin Rudd knocked back an AC several times, believing awards should go to those who are devoted to serving their community but are rarely thanked. Mr Rudd eventually accepted an AC last year for what he saw as recognition of his post-politics work in promoting understanding of Asia’s peoples and cultures and world peace.
Announcement of the awards each Australia Day and Queen’s Birthday is often greeted with as much scorn as it is with ovation for high-profile recipients. That’s understandable, as one person’s prime-time soothsayer is another’s sozzled, sweary troll. Too often people are getting gongs for doing their jobs while being paid a fortune, important as many of these roles are to society. Some from the corporate elite, obsessed with procuring, at the very least, an Officer of the Order of Australia, are social climbing via philanthropic ranks and employing surrogates to prepare their applications for recognition that befits their ego. Mr Rudd was right. The system should be geared to honouring those who work without glory to help others and to improve the community. It’s time for system renovation because the built-in dynamics are producing a hierarchy antithetical to our values.
As Matthew Denholm reported on Monday, in the most recent Queen’s Birthday honours civil list only four of 53 recipients of an AC or AO gained their gong for service to the community rather than to a profession or area of work. Economist Nick Gruen has found the awards are weighted to those of high status rather than community champions. From 2013 to 2018, less than 30 per cent of all AC recipients had done community work, dropping to 10 per cent in 2019-20, excluding this month’s awards. Those volunteering for decades or going “above and beyond” in helping others tend to receive the lowly Medal of the Order of Australia. A few quiet achievers may receive the next honour one level up, the Member of the Order of Australia.
Awards are decided by the Council of the Order of Australia, chaired by former Northern Territory chief minister Shane Stone. It’s true anyone can nominate anyone or themselves, but the 19-member council should be assiduously apolitical and not narrowly cast. One way to get better recognition for grassroots heroes, argues Dr Gruen, is to have a citizen’s jury of 25 people, randomly chosen, to deliberate on the values they want to reward. The current condition for written references means indigenous people are less likely to be recognised. As well, there has been an almost doubling of awards, from 847 in 2000 to 1547 in this year. The proportion of nominations accepted has risen from 58 per cent in 2000 to 72 per cent this year. At these odds, little wonder medical, legal and military bodies seek to secure awards and upgrades for members. At the very least, the Morrison government needs to implement a thorough review. The honours system should be more open, discerning and egalitarian. Even monarchists agree. Community and charitable work should be properly recognised, not relegated to the lower ranks of awards, and the criteria weighted away from banal careerism, regardless of the field. Former chief of the defence force and one-time council member Chris Barrie argues the system may be “preserving a hangover of the British imperial system”. It certainly looks that way, creating a new social pecking order. Governor-General David Hurley, who approves appointments, told Denholm the Order of Australia belongs to and represents all of us. Australians “must have confidence in it”, he said. “It must continue to evolve — as our society does — and reflect and recognise the best of Australia.” Right now, our national honours system is falling short of those lofty goals.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Uni funding should boost jobs	The Australian	Higher education is vital in lifting the post-COVID economy
Consultations between the Morrison government and universities about Education Minister Dan Tehan’s proposed higher education reforms present a timely opportunity to allocate resources in the best interests of the sector and the economy, to the benefit of young adults facing years of serious employment challenges. Last week, we reported that Treasury head Steven Kennedy had warned business and union leaders that unemployment was set to remain significantly above its pre-­pandemic levels for four or five years. The “COVID generation” of young workers aged 20 to 29 were likely to be hardest hit. For many of them and for school-leavers, the outlook will reinforce the value of a university education.
In June, Mr Tehan announced significant changes to university fees to improve incentives for students to enrol in agriculture, maths, nursing, teaching and science courses and to raise the cost of humanities degrees. The proposals have drawn a cold response from universities, including the Group of Eight, which has branded them “inexplicable” and likely to “lead to perverse outcomes”.
Despite bleak job prospects, Australia continues to face skills shortages. The problem is not only a matter of inadequate numbers of graduates in fields such as engineering but also the skills graduates are learning, or not learning, in courses. In engineering, research compiled by the Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business last year showed employers had large pools of qualified applicants, 16 on average per vacancy, but 87 per cent of the qualified applications were unsuitable. The main problems were lack of experience in a particular specialisation, insufficient technical skills and poor application, interview or work history. The research also showed Australia was short of mining and electrical engineers. In other occupations, including nursing, accounting and agricultural science, employers reported that many qualified applicants lacked the skills to fill available jobs. After the loss of billions of dollars in revenue from international students because of COVID-19, university leaders’ insistence on secure funding makes sense. The sector is facing about 21,000 job losses. In return for taxpayer funding, universities face an important role in better preparing students for the job opportunities that will emerge in a changing marketplace as Australia recovers. It makes sense that maths, science and engineering should be promoted to students as post-pandemic job creators. But it is odd, as Richard Ferguson reported on Tuesday, that universities would be paid $4758 less per student to teach science under the government’s funding proposals due to reductions in student fees and direct government funding. What makes more sense is the recognition in the proposed changes that many young people are better suited to skills and vocational training outside university. The Regional Universities Network is concerned that plans to remove HECS for students who fail to complete 50 per cent of their first-year university subjects is “too prescriptive”. But the objective of the measure is reasonable, as the RUN acknowledges. As the sector, Labor and crossbenchers debate and negotiate the proposals with the government, growth and the job needs of the COVID generation should be front and centre.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Constructing a recovery with bricks and mortar	The Australian	HomeBuilder has kept the industry buoyant but must be limited Australia’s love affair with housing has helped to blunt the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent recession. Retail figures show consumer spending on white goods has been red-hot and there has been a trend away from inner-city units towards bigger properties in the suburbs or in regional centres with good transport links to major cities. Working from home while the kids study under the same roof has produced an epiphany: if there is a risk of being confined to barracks by government, better to make those lodgings as spacious and comfortable as possible.
As a result, early fears of a collapse in house prices have not been realised. Emergency cuts to interest rates have helped to keep the real estate market buoyant and, as figures reported on Wednesday show, so has the federal government’s HomeBuilder program that targeted house construction and renovation as a good way to pump money into the economy.
Under the HomeBuilder program, home buyers and renovators were able to claim a grant of $25,000 towards a complying property. This was reduced to $15,000 in November when the program was extended to March 31 this year. Government figures show that more than 75,000 households have applied for a HomeBuilder grant, about three times higher than expected. The cost to government from the scheme has ballooned from $688m to $2bn, but economists expect the scheme to support $18bn of new construction and $50bn in broader economic growth.
HomeBuilder and extremely low interest rates are only part of the story that has helped to shore up housing in the face of the pandemic. Banks have offered payment relief for homebuyers unable to make mortgage repayments, and the federal government’s JobKeeper program has allowed borrowers to keep their head above water. These assistance programs are coming to an end, together with protections for company directors who have been shielded from insolvency regulations during the pandemic. As the safety net is lifted, the impact of lockdowns and other constraints on business will become increasingly apparent during the first half of this year.
While the boom in new house building has been a welcome boost for tradespeople and some first-home buyers, it has not dealt with some of the structural issues that arise due to COVID-19. These include an effective halt to overseas migration and the absence of foreign students.
The very low interest rates that have encouraged many people to double down on housing with big mortgages could well prove to be a double-edged sword for house prices. In an internal review, the Reserve Bank of Australia has predicted that home values could rise by as much as 30 per cent within three years due to borrower belief that rock-bottom interest rates are here to stay. The RBA warns that if price rises induce large amounts of new property construction, this can create an overhang of excess supply and risks for lenders and borrowers.
Low interest rates also punish savers, while a focus on home lending can be at the expense of supporting more productive sectors of the economy. Heavily indebted homeowners can also limit the political appetite to respond effectively to any outbreak in inflation. On balance, the government’s HomeBuilder scheme has had the desired effect of keeping things buoyant — but the program should not be kept any longer than absolutely necessary.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
A new you is easy	Herald on Sunday	How many New Year resolutions did you make this year — if any?
And, five days in to 2020, how many have you already broken?
It’s tough, right? Especially with major issues to solve: world peace, climate change, Brexit ... And what about the things within our control that make the list each year after previous failures? You know the ones: lose weight, drink less, quit smoking ...
But don’t worry, be happy, today we’ve got the perfect solution — and it’s about keeping it simple.
We asked experts in a range of fields to name just one thing people could do to change their life this year.
Sick of your job? Life’s too short to have a bad one, so career coach Allison Fisher suggests rating your work out of 10. If it’s 5 or less: “Find some support to help make the change to a 10.”
Natalie Jane, of Be Organised, believes one simple way to improve your life is to get rid of stuff you don’t need. “Clinging on to possessions causes stress as we then become frightened of losing them. But by letting go, you gain so much more.”
For financial consultant Lisa Dudson, it’s taking charge of your spending — and therefore saving — by simply asking: “Do I really need it, can I get better value elsewhere, and do I need to buy new versus second hand?”
And when it comes to family, the best thing you can spend on your kids is time, teacher Michele Morrisey-Brown says. Simple, free — and the stuff from which memories are made.
Relationship on the rocks or in need of some TLC? Stop being so defensive and be mindful of what’s going on for your partner, says therapist Dr Anna Martin — it’ll help you both.
And the biggie — climate change — is undoubtedly daunting, but climate scientist James Renwick says if you do just one thing in 2020, make it this: “Talk about climate change and the climate emergency. Make it normal in your house to speak about what’s happening with the climate. Let your MPs and local government representatives know you want action.”

You don’t have to be culture vulture to get some great advice on the written page, and bookseller, writer and reviewer Kiran Dass recommends two books to get 2020 off to a great start.

Love her or hate her - election will be close	The Northern Advocate	I find myself this morning wondering what would happen if Steve Price, the Australian broadcaster and commentator, came upon a magazine with Jacinda Ardern on the cover? Would he scowl, sigh and then turn the magazine around? I say this because Price has launched into a remarkable tirade about our Prime Minister on the Australian programme The Project that would make him a prime #TurnArdern disciple.
He was commenting on a positive story about Ardern’s holiday to Queensland potentially boosting post-bush fire tourism to Australia. He didn’t like it at all.
“She should be in her own country and spend money in her own place. Typical virtue signalling from Ardern. I get sick and tired of that woman!”
And there we have it. Ardern did nothing wrong. In fact she did something right — but Pricey just doesn’t like “that woman”. It was a ridiculous thing for a smart man to say but his visceral dislike for Jacinda Ardern is shared by a surprising number of people.
Jacinda is just too empathetic, she’s just too young, she dared to have a baby in office, she’s too polite and to cap it off her teeth are just too big. But on the other hand there are many people who love the very things Pricey hates.
It’s why Labour ended up where it is leading a government. Combined with National alienating New Zealand First. So it’s election year and the question is: can Jacinda and her mates do it again?
Take into account the haters of her virtue signalling like Steve Price. Take into account the year of (non) delivery. Take into account the ethical scandals. Take into account the deputies that also infuriate conservatives and the centre right. Will this be a one-term Government?
Matthew Hooton is prepared to nail a prediction to the door. In this month’s Metro magazine he writes that Labour will win this year’s election. He argues that the Government’s missteps are par for most governments’ course. He argues that this year’s infrastructure spend will lift the nation’s mood.
But at the end of the day all MMP elections are razor-thin close.
Nothing has really changed from 2017. Meanwhile Jacinda Ardern is still there infuriating Steve Price but enchanting the people who like hugs.
Hooton’s not wrong. It’s going to be close.

EDITORIAL BY ILONA HANNE It makes sense to spend a few more cents	Wanganui Chronicle	I think every New Zealander knows the message of Stay Home, Save Lives, right now.
In fact, I saw my 8-year-old carefully write it out in chalk on our driveway on the weekend.
I would like to see another message get through though right now.
Shop local.
No, it’s not a new idea, but now more than ever, it is a good idea.
To start with, whether we are at level 4 or level 3, the key point is to stay local, to not travel, so we should already be shopping at our local supermarket, not the one in the next town.
But what about the businesses that aren’t open right now? They are struggling to pay staff and their rent, rates and so on, while not being able to bring much, if any, money in.
Some have been able to adapt slightly and offer online shopping and delivery for essential items, but some can’t. The problem is, while our New Zealand businesses might be unable to sell to us right now, their overseas-based competitors can.
You might not be able to walk into PaperPlus or Perera’s Paper Power to buy a book this week, but you can probably buy one from somewhere else online. That doesn’t mean you should, though.
Buying from an overseas retailer means you are putting money into someone else’s economy. You are paying wages for an employee who is unlikely to ever then spend their money in our town, and you are supporting a business that isn’t actually going to support you.
Don’t believe me? When was the last time Amazon gave you a book token for your school PTA fundraiser? Exactly. But I bet you or someone you know have been given all sorts of raffle prizes and donations for various fundraisers over the years from our local shops and businesses.
It is time to be less selfish, and put our community first.
Sometimes, shopping locally costs us a tiny bit more. On the price tag of the item itself that is. But it doesn’t cost us postage, petrol or parking, and it costs us less of our own time — which also has a value of course. Plus, I am fairly sure those big-box, out-of-town retailers don’t help you top up your mobile phone when you buy a prepay voucher from them as I know some of our shops here in town do.
If our local shops can’t stay open in the coming tough times, then we lose more than a bricks-and-mortar store on our high street.
Without jobs, people leave our town. That means fewer people to volunteer at the local youth group, to coach our kids’ netball, to volunteer with St John.
When we lose our local businesses, we lose the pulse of our community.
We need to do all we can to keep them going.
So when our local shops open their doors again, support them.
In fact, support them now while they are still closed. Message them and ask if they sell vouchers you can buy now, and use later. Ask your hairdresser if you can pay in advance for your next cut, and if you need to buy someone a present, buy them a voucher from a local store.
As level 3 comes in next week, some of our local eateries will potentially be able to open for contactless takeaways.
Please, support them not just with your orders, but also with kindness. Remember they are having to adapt quickly, so they might not get everything right the first time, but they will be trying their best. Don’t be impatient, be supportive.
After all, supporting them isn’t just going to give you a break from what seems like about a year of home cooking every day, but it will also have a knock-on effect. You are helping them pay their staff, who in turn will shop locally in our town.
They also are buying their ingredients from other suppliers, again putting more money into our community’s economy.
So spend a few more cents over the next few months and invest in our community. Give back to the businesses who have always supported our schools, our clubs and sports groups, and help our community and town survive Covid-19‘s economic impact.

Difficult times for Coromandel towns	Bay of Plenty Times	I write this editorial having just returned from the announcement that Beach Hop is postponed.
It is a major for our towns and it won’t be the only event not going ahead for a while. Several are now postponed, most likely until Labour Weekend.
The Coromandel’s reliance on its visitor industry will come into sharp focus. Destination Coromandel currently has a campaign promoting shoulder season travel to domestic visitors. The Take it Easy campaign encourages travellers to enjoy the wide open spaces on walking and biking tracks, such as the Hauraki Rail Trail and Coromandel Coastal Walkway.
This is part of its planned domestic tourism activity. In 2019 the domestic travel market was worth $387m to The Coromandel region.
It’s been a hugely challenging week for many and the gravity of the Government’s announcement on Saturday is still unrealised.
A overseas friend who owns a bach on the Coromandel and who has visited every year for 25 years is among those left wondering when he will be able to return to his second home.
After trying to get his head around what ‘self-isolation’ for two weeks would ultimately mean for him and his family, his flight was cancelled.
In uncertain times like these, having a plan, using common sense, staying calm — and thinking of others — is surely all that any of us can do.
Take care of yourself and others and if you are feeling socially isolated, make sure you call a friend for a chat. Or why not pen me a letter at Coastal News? news@coastalnews.co.nz	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Uni arts students sold short on riches of their heritage	The Australian	Identity politics and critical race theory perspectives need pruning Gender and race are legitimate themes for study, analysis and debate in universities’ humanities courses. Disciplines such as history, literature and social science should encourage students to take a broad view of the world and think independently, grounded in a deep knowledge of their subjects. Humanities courses overrun by identity politics and ideology, however, fail to provide the liberal arts education students are entitled to expect. To the contrary, such courses narrow students’ understandings of the world around them. The problem fuels divisions within the general community, evidenced by perennial controversies around Australia Day and “cancel culture’’ campaigns for the removal of public statues associated with European settlement. The trend is then perpetuated in schools, as a high proportion of humanities graduates become classroom teachers.
An audit of Bachelor of Arts subjects at 10 top universities last year by the Institute of Public Affairs found 572 subjects, or 44 per cent of 1181 subjects analysed, were concerned with identity politics. A further 380 featured critical race theory, a US-born framework for studying race and power. It coined such concepts as “white privilege” and “structural racism”. About 25 per cent of subjects focused specifically on gender issues. Such themes were dominant in humanities courses at Macquarie (70 per cent), and Melbourne (61 per cent) and Sydney universities (59 per cent). The dominance of such themes — which should be fair game for critical scrutiny — short-changes many students. Only a quarter of English literature subjects involved the study of great works comprising the Western canon, Rebecca Urban reported. And just 23 per cent of history subjects covered Western civilisation, from Ancient Greece to the modern world. Only 10 per cent of political science subjects surveyed taught students about the history of ideas and political thought. And freedom, a concept highly valued in democracies and traditionally a key tenet of the study of the social sciences, was featured in just 10 per cent of a possible 524 subjects.
IPA director Bella d’Abrera, who carried out the review, said academics obsessed with identity politics had turned the humanities into a political project. Subjects had become “homogenised” to the extent it was “almost impossible to differentiate’’ between sociology and English literature; philosophy and sociology. Regardless of the subject, the same worldview, of identity politics and critical race theory, was repeated through all disciplines. For example, one course on the history of sport examines the meaning of sport across “class, racial, gender and ethnic groups”, including “the rise of female, LGBT and transgender athletes”. The major problem is not that or any other particular subject — it is the preponderance of the trend, and the exclusion of much of the riches of history, literature, philosophy and political science. For many taxpayers, the trend underlines the sense of the Morrison government’s lifting fees for humanities courses in a bid to steer young people to nursing, maths, science and engineering courses, which offer greater job prospects. It also shows that the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation, which sponsors great books-style courses at several universities, and Campion College, a private liberal arts university in Sydney, are filling a major gap in the nation’s education. Campion College president Paul Morrissey is correct when he says disciplines such as literature and history should be studied for their own sake, using a wide range of interpretative lenses.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Polarised and challenged, US still has the right stuff	The Australian	Identity politics and social media have deepened the divide
One American dream, on the eve of this extraordinary presidential election, is to wake up to normality in which satire does not compete with reality and not every corner of life is shrill with political slogans. It’s an understandable wish; many Americans are exhausted from polarised conflict and the lurch of bewildering events. But the US is not the only Western democracy in turbulent times, and the choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, important as it is, cannot offer an easy way out of the challenges facing America — and, by extension, liberal democracies, such as Australia, which have long drawn inspiration from the civilisational success of the US.
A new cold war with China and Russia, globalism out of favour, pandemic drawbridges up, contagion choking trade and economic growth and killing jobs, a hyper-emotional culture of self-righteous censorship in what we still call open societies, and politicians exchanging policy ambition for populist gestures — this appears to be the new normal, especially in the US, and there is no obvious way to escape it. But we forget how discombobulating the old normal was, now that it seems safely remote and orderly in the pages of history. Individually and together, the US and like-minded nations that value freedom and prosperity can find a path through what look like labyrinthine problems, and we should not underestimate the potential of American leadership. In periods of rapid, disorienting change, it’s easy to overlook continuities. The US is still a global powerhouse of intellect and industry, of technology, invention and creative genius. The supposedly inexorable rise of hegemonic China, and American declinism — which has been so confidently and prematurely declared — both warrant scepticism. Excitable predictions that Donald Trump would become a tyrant were just wrong. At times he is reckless with words and shows illiberal impulses, but the Founding Fathers never expected all presidents to be choirboys and they built institutions that have proved resilient and robust. Court decisions have not gone his way, but Trump has accepted them.
So, too, we shouldn’t pay much attention to his loose talk of not accepting the election result. It’s a showman’s bluster, aimed in part at revving up his base. And despite Joe Biden’s consistent edge in the polls, the result is not a foregone conclusion. The margin in key swing states has narrowed. There’s good reason to believe many Americans have stopped telling the truth to the pollsters. Elite culture has been permeated with the false image of the Trump supporter as a bigoted fascist. There is now a whole portfolio of politically incorrect beliefs and attitudes that many people in the West keep close to their chests.
Another factor keeping the election open until the last minute is Trump’s remarkable, barnstorming energy in the campaign; only last month he was seriously ill with COVID-19. The base wants rallies, and he delivers. Many supporters see his term as a record of promises kept. He presided over a booming, pre-pandemic economy with good job figures, brought soldiers home, turned up the trade temperature with China, notched up unexpected Middle East peace deals and generally projected a feel-good image of America which appealed to an alienated mainstream. This much has been conceded even by many who deplore Trump’s character, personal conduct and language. A more significant electoral issue is how middle — and elderly — America judge his handling of the pandemic. There’s no doubt he temporised, and confused people with mixed messages and careless speculation. But a partisan, parochial myth has been created that COVID-19 has found no greater killing ground than the US, and that Trump is to blame. In fact, the US is not the worst place to be, judging by per capita death rates around the world. And, in any case, America is a federation and much responsibility for major outbreaks of the virus falls to governors and mayors, many of them Democrats who have not been excoriated in the same way. Trump made missteps, it’s true, but there is still lively expert disagreement about the best, most balanced response to the pandemic.
What might a second Trump term look like? Probably more of the same, which means unpredictable. The fact that another Trump victory cannot be ruled out — as it was by many complacent Democrat voters who stayed home in 2016, assuming Hillary Clinton was predestined for the White House — may work to Biden’s advantage. He needs all the anti-Trumpers found by pollsters to make the effort and turn out to vote in a pandemic. Early ballots have been at a historic high.
Biden appears a decent man with a common touch that Clinton lacked, and empathy desirable in a president at a time of rancour. His campaign has been run as an appeal to the political centre and competence. But his experience is a two-edged sword, also reminding voters of the Obama years when “strategic patience” meant letting America’s enemies steal a march. And Biden can be seen as an establishment time-server lacking the principle or energy to preside over a revitalisation of congressional politics as an engine of rational policy. He appears older than his 77 years, and is a grudging compromise candidate of a Democratic Party in which most of the zeal is on the far left. This could make him a weak, transitional president, elevating Kamala Harris as more powerful than a typical vice-president, and setting up a potential mid-term struggle over the direction of the party.
Would Biden in the White House be good news for Americans pledged to equal opportunity and justice but horrified by the violence and unreason exemplified by the excesses of the Black Lives Matters movement? Many of these are black Americans who want effective, not defunded, policing. They will have been reassured by Biden’s swift denunciation of violent riots in Philadelphia but puzzled by his seeming naivety about Antifa thugs and the BLM ideology. As for Harris, her record as California’s top law official was pro law and order, but the “equality and equity” video she chose to release at the end of the campaign seems a confused pandering to the “equal outcomes” ideology of critical race studies. This jars with the American ethos of individual enterprise. It’s just not clear whether a commanding Biden victory would bring the Democrats back towards the centre, or embolden the radical left, which has already captured so much of the elite political culture.
This has happened with alarming speed. Leftist identity politics of a divisive kind has shown its power not just on riot-torn city streets but in major corporations, mainstream media, education and the tech platforms. It’s tied up with a dramatic, still unfolding shift in public conversation and political debate to social media, which sharpens tribal divides, drives out nuance, and promotes emotion over reason. Trump is in the thick of this, also giving voice to those who resent tech platform curation and online mobbing campaigns as anti-conservative mischief. Twitter’s absurd and counterproductive attempt to quash the Hunter Biden email story played into this. Biden himself seems a figure from an age before digital, although his party is the natural home of always-online social justice warriors. Real-world strategic struggle will demand swift attention by the US, whoever is elected president. Trump’s undiplomatic manoeuvres have kept America’s authoritarian rivals guessing but steady competence is also needed. After drift and passivity under Barack Obama, Biden would be wise to project firm and clear objectives to discourage opportunism by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Australia has a special interest in these geopolitical risks, not only because of our alliance with the US, but because key flashpoints for conflict are uncomfortably close to us. Trump’s isolationism has given our defence and security establishment some anxious moments but, by and large, his administration has maintained a useful engagement with the Asia-Pacific region. Biden’s approach to foreign affairs has been marketed as the restoration of a US role working in concert with allies and multilateral organisations to reduce tensions. There is global appetite for more stability but the test will be the credibility of US power and deterrence. Australia will play a constructive part — whoever is in the White House — confident of our mutual interests and values. There is a tremendous reservoir of goodwill around the world for the American project and the hope it represents. The US was formed as a nation out of conflict, and although it faces multiple hazards at home and abroad, there is every reason to believe it still has the right stuff.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIALGive Opera House space to breathe	Hawkes Bay Today	If I could take my pick of “organisation of the year” for Hawke’s Bay in 2020, I’d probably pick Hastings District Council.
The infighting that prompted a bizarre leak inquiry around local government election time is largely gone, at least publicly.
In its place is a council making decisions that seem to be transforming Hastings’ CBD.
Its investment in Eat Street on Heretaunga St East has the potential to be brilliant. The Toitoi Hawke’s Bay Opera House renovations and the addition of a central city hotel are set to bring world-class acts here once borders reopen.
The finishing of Municipal Building reno required some urgent unbudgeted ratepayer dosh — a $5.5 million loan to be paid back over 25 years — but once it is, the nightlife and general vibrancy of the city will be leaps and bounds ahead of where it was even three years ago.
It makes it all the more surprising to see the council making what I feel is a mistake just across the road.
The demolition of the Wesley Methodist Church hall (opposite Toitoi) was only decided upon in October, when the Government gave the parish more than $100,000 to build a new one.
But now that the hall has been dismantled, the potential of the area as an open public space has been revealed.
The Opera House is a fine piece of architecture, but it doesn’t have the space to breathe at the moment. Look to any city in Europe and its best buildings are placed in squares where you can step back and appreciate them. If you surrounded the Eiffel Tower with similarly tall buildings, rather than the enormous park expanse that it sits in, it too would lose most of its impact.
The Hastings District Council in late 2019 granted the Sikh community a resource consent to build a new gurudwara (temple) on plains production land in Raymond Rd, which means its run-down building next door is soon to be up for grabs, if it hasn’t been snapped up already.
Just imagine if this council had the foresight to secure both pieces of land, demolish the hall and gurudwara, pedestrianise Hastings St between Eastbourne and Heretaunga and build a public square around the Wesley Methodist Church.
Toitoi talks a big game about its buildings bringing the community inside, but one of the best ways to do that would be events outside.
Night markets, busking festivals, maybe even a central city farmer’s market would work in that space. Fringe in the ‘Stings would love it.
Another option, given the Pacific and Indian links to the church buildings in the area, would be for the council to create a sculptured space that champions Hastings’ diversity and highlights how important immigrant labour is for the city.
Hastings is close to being a city that tourists could realistically choose as an option to stay in over Napier.
But when it comes to tourism, there’s no room to drop the ball right in the heart of the area you’ve already invested tens of millions.

Afghan service ending at last	The Australian	If the Taliban resumes backing terrorism it must be stopped
After 18 years fighting alongside US and coalition forces in Afghanistan, Australia has good reason to welcome the troop withdrawal agreement signed by the Trump administration and the Taliban. As Peter Dutton said on the ABC’s Insiders, “well done on the US for being able to broker” a deal that Donald Trump said would see an “immediate” start on drawing down US troops from 13,000 to 8600 over the next four months, with the aim of achieving a complete withdrawal of coalition forces in the next 14 months.
The precise timing of a withdrawal of the 400 Australian troops still in Afghanistan will be worked out with the US. Ensuring the Taliban abides by what it agreed to in Doha will be vital. Mr Trump must allow no compromises, despite his undisguised political desire to see most US forces home by November’s presidential election.
The Doha deal commits the Taliban to negotiations on “a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire and the future political road map for Afghanistan”. The medieval Islamist terrorists who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, helping Osama bin Laden and al-Qa’ida when the 9/11 attacks were being plotted, have also committed to preventing “terrorists” from using Afghanistan as a base for attacks on the West. Mr Trump, remarkably, said he expected the Taliban to “take up the fight against ISIS” and other terrorist groups. Whether such optimism is well-founded remains to be seen.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is worried. He told a meeting of US ambassadors last week he was going to Doha only because Mr Trump insisted on it and that he remained angry about 9/11. In Doha, Mr Pompeo did not clap when Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the Taliban in its most murderous days, spoke. Mr Pompeo left without shaking hands with the Taliban leader. He would rightly have been irked when the Taliban issued a statement claiming the deal was a victory for the fight to end the US “occupation” of Afghanistan.Mr Pompeo said Washington would do “whatever is necessary” if the Taliban did not stick by the terms of the deal. The Trump administration must be resolute on that undertaking. The immensely costly mistake by Barack Obama in Iraq when, for self-serving political reasons in 2011, he withdrew US forces too soon, paving the way for the ISIS caliphate, must not be forgotten. Fourteen months is not long. The sacrifices of Australians and others who have fought in Afghanistan will be ill-served if the country regresses to what it was when the Taliban ruled Kabul before 2001.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Economic strength propels McGowan towards victory	The Australian	If the polls are correct, the WA Libs face a major rebuilding challenge Judging by the mood across Western Australia — which is reflected in opinion polls — voters in the state are well satisfied with life and will reward Premier Mark McGowan and his Labor government accordingly on Saturday. As we reported last week, WA recorded the best budget performance in the world through the COVID-19 pandemic, underpinned by a boom in mining royalties that shielded the state’s bottom line from the world’s worst economic crisis in a century. Analysis by S&P Global Ratings shows WA has been a standout not only in Australia but in state jurisdictions around the world. While collapsing revenues and surging spending have left much of the nation and the world floundering in red ink, WA’s pre-election fiscal update projects a 2020-21 surplus of $3.1bn. Mr McGowan’s move, early in the pandemic, to allow mining companies to continue to fly in essential skilled workers set the state up to take advantage of surging iron ore prices. As a major exporting state — WA produces 48 per cent of Australia’s goods exports — its economic success is the nation’s success.
After taking Labor from 21 to 41 out of 59 Legislative Assembly seats in the 2017 election, Mr McGowan has been a strong leader. He has managed the economy well, both before and during the pandemic. In 2018, he struck a good deal with the Morrison government to ensure WA would receive at least 70c back from every dollar it pays in GST. And from 2024-25, the state’s GST payments will be set at a minimum 75c in the dollar. The deal, backed by both sides of federal politics, ended a decade of dissatisfaction in the west over the application of fiscal equalisation, which saw the state’s share of its GST payments fall to as low as 30c in the dollar at one point.
Mr McGowan, a lawyer, grew up in NSW, attended university in Brisbane and came to WA when the navy posted him there in 1991. He was elected as an MP five years later, served as a minister in the Gallop government and was elected opposition leader in 2012. He connected strongly with the WA public, and in 2017 defeated Liberal premier Colin Barnett. Some pundits believe Labor could all but wipe out the Liberals on Saturday, which says more about the opposition than it does about Mr McGowan.
Eight years ago, the WA Liberals were one of the party’s strongest, best-funded divisions in the nation. In 2008, the party turned to Mr Barnett, who had announced his retirement from politics, to return to the leadership. He won two terms. But the lack of succession planning became clear after Mr Barnett’s loss to Mr McGowan in 2017.
Zak Kirkup, 34, who is still in his first term in parliament, is the party’s fourth leader in four years. He replaced Liza Harvey, a former deputy premier, less than four months ago. Ms Harvey replaced Mike Nahan, a former treasurer, in mid-2019. Thrusting Mr Kirkup forward too soon could cost the party a future leader. He has already conceded he cannot win on Saturday. Last month, he said if he did not hold his marginal seat of Dawesville, south of Perth, he would leave the political arena.
On policy, the Liberals’ attempt to outdo the ALP with progressive policies, such as shutting down WA’s state-owned coal-fired power stations, a strategy rejected by Mr McGowan, has allowed the government to portray itself as more economically responsible than its opponents.
Amid strong prosperity, WA voters are unlikely to be impressed by the advertising blitz against Mr McGowan by the militant CFMEU over plans to replace the port of Fremantle with a new outer harbour in Cockburn Sound in Perth’s south. The unions are also bitter over Mr McGowan’s $1000 cap on public sector pay rises, a move that should appeal to swinging voters. On the negative side, Mr McGowan’s overblown stubbornness about maintaining hard borders for months longer than needed during the pandemic undermined WA tourism, the airline industry and the national economy. It will help rather than hinder him on Saturday because he tapped into a deep-seated populist sentiment in the west. But the crisis exposed the Premier’s authoritarian streak and his preparedness to brush aside the national interest, when it suits him, in favour or parochialism. He recently undermined hopes of national cabinet reaching a unified, sensible position on managing state borders. And until sense prevailed, he mooted the idea of leaving border controls imposed to tackle COVID-19 in place in the name of fighting crime. As WA’s strongest Labor leader since the heyday of Brian Burke, Mr McGowan’s ties with the WA business community have been seized on by critics as echoing Mr Burke’s WA Inc era. This is a different time and environment. It is also natural, given WA’s small business community, that local billionaires such as Kerry Stokes and Andrew Forrest will be involved with government. But Mr Burke, who ran into trouble in the 1980s raising vast sums of money for Labor’s campaigns, recently advised Mr McGowan to ban donations from property developers. The issue is one the opposition, the media and the upper house need to watch. Good opposition is vital to good government. But it is the WA Liberals who face a major rebuilding job in the coming term.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
COMMENT Peters not only one spinning all the hits	Wanganui Chronicle	If there’s one thing Winston Peters loves, it’s music – which is probably why his old crooner mate John Rowles got a knighthood in this Government’s first honours list.
But perhaps the NZ First leader chose the wrong pop group when he used his mobile phone to play Queen, telling journalists to listen up to Radio Gaga before walking off, sniggering, to his Beehive office.
One can only hope he didn’t listen to the rest of his Queen Spotify list. Another hit – Another One Bites the Dust – is surely right up there.
Peters is obviously feeling what another Queen hit tells us all about being Under Pressure, given he resorted to Facebook again to castigate those who he believes are out to destroy his party.
It’s as though the Queen hit-list should be a theme for this Government at the moment.
Think about Jacinda Ardern’s insistence that she only talks to Peters about coronavirus and the economy. We’re expected to believe she hasn’t at any stage mentioned to him the Serious Fraud Office investigation into the NZ First Foundation.
An incredulous Simon Bridges got the answer he refused to believe last week, that Ardern trusts Peters. And not only that, she told Parliament she has faith in him.
As far as the SFO investigation goes, she says let them do their job. If their job finds wrongdoing she dismisses that as hypothetical and says judgments will be made after that.
Who could forgive Ardern for heading home last night and listening to Queen’s I Want To Ride My Bicycle, followed immediately by I Want To Break Free?
Taking the We Are The Champions moral high ground in all of this is National, which of course they shouldn’t be. It was under the current leader’s watch that the Chinese donation rolled in that’s the subject of an Auckland court case next week, even though neither they nor the party will be in the dock.
Bridges said the party would be paying back the $100,000 donation that now turns out to be double that. So will they be paying all of it back?
Play The Game, he seemed to sneer, and in a Flash delivered that well-used political answer: He knows nothing about it.

COMMENT Under-fire Peters still facing the music	The Northern Advocate	If there’s one thing Winston Peters loves, it’s music — which is probably why his old crooner mate John Rowles got a knighthood in this Government’s first honours list.
The New Zealand First leader once had Rowles thunder on to the stage at a party conference before he dismounted and burst into song.
But perhaps he chose the wrong pop group when he used his mobile phone to play Queen, telling journalists to listen up to Radio Gaga before walking off, sniggering, to his Beehive office.
One can only hope he didn’t listen to the rest of his Queen Spotify playlist. Another hit — Another One Bites the Dust — is surely right up there.
Even though he makes light of it, Peters is obviously feeling what another Queen hit tells us all about being Under Pressure, given he resorted to Facebook again to castigate those who he believes are out to destroy his party.
It’s as though the Queen hit list should be a theme for this Government at the moment.
Think about Jacinda Ardern’s insistence that she only talks to Peters about coronavirus and the economy. We’re expected to believe she hasn’t at any stage mentioned to him the Serious Fraud Office investigation into the New Zealand First Foundation.

Road map to despair for 6.6 million Victorians	The Australian	If this regime applied in NSW, Sydney would be in lockdown Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton are not admitting it, but there are realistic alternatives to the devastating road map announced on Sunday. Restrictions, including Melbourne’s new 9pm curfew, will not be eased significantly for seven weeks, until October 26 — and only then if the tally of new COVID-19 cases falls to a daily average of less than five, over the previous 14 days. On that basis, Sydney would be locked down today, with most shops closed and residents barred from restaurants, many workplaces or venturing out after 9pm. Unlike NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s government, which is providing effective leadership in how to live with coronavirus without being crushed by it, the Andrews government, in forcing Victorians to remain bunkered down, will continue to hurt millions and destroy once-viable businesses for months. Mr Andrews and Professor Sutton insist such a road map is necessary to avoid a third COVID wave and purport to base their decisions on science and expert modelling. But, as Professor Sutton now concedes, the six weeks for the stage-four lockdown was in some respects “guesswork’’. It remains to be seen how much of the road map towards a normal Christmas also turns out to be “guesswork’’.
What is not guesswork is the impact of the “road to nowhere’’, as Victoria’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry described it, on businesses, jobs and national economic recovery. Business owners who have been hanging on desperately for months will now see their enterprises fold, as chamber CEO Paul Guerra, a COVID survivor, says. Such owners will now need to look their employees in the eye and tell them they no longer have a job. While devastating for those workers, their families and their chances of hanging on to heavily mortgaged homes, that is also bad news for the federal budget bottom line and taxpayers nationally. The ongoing decimation of our second-largest state economy will stymie growth across the nation. It comes on top of us falling into recession for the first time in 28 years and the premiers of WA and Queensland — Mark McGowan and Annastacia Palaszczuk — showing all the selfishness of stroppy teenagers keeping their borders slammed shut.
In describing the Victorian arrangements as “hard and crushing news for the people of Victoria’’, Scott Morrison, Josh Frydenberg and Health Minister Greg Hunt were restrained in their response to Mr Andrews’s announcement. The road map, as they noted, will come at an economic cost and a cost to mental health.
The first round of restrictions to be eased from 11.59pm next Sunday — pushing the curfew to 9pm, reopening playgrounds, an extra hour of exercise a day and single “social bubbles” — will do nothing for the economy and jobs. The second round, from September 28, COVID numbers permitting, will have little effect on economic activity.
As we said on Saturday, the arrest and handcuffing of a pregnant mum in her own home in Ballarat last week had the hallmarks of a police state. Sunday’s announcement, too, smacked of a state-knows-best, central planning mentality. This big-government approach paid scant regard to basic liberties and gave little credence to the common sense of most citizens. Rather than emphasising the importance of householders practising careful hygiene and social distancing when welcoming visitors, for example, so-called “social bubbles’’ for those who live alone will be limited to hosting one visitor at home. Most people are sufficiently discerning to host several different people and avoid the risks of COVID transmission.
Similar arguments apply to business. There is no reason, as Business Council of Australia boss Jennifer Westacott said on Sunday, why businesses should not be given the green light to reopen if they have COVID-safe plans in place and are in areas with no community transmissions. Instead, as peak industry bodies are warning, the road map offers a “death sentence” for many retailers, especially in Melbourne. Australian Retailers Association CEO Paul Zahra makes a valid comparison when he says the Victorian government is being unrealistic to target single-digit daily case rates before reopening. NSW, in contrast, has remained open and on track with about 10-18 new daily cases during much of August. Melbourne has long been regarded as Australia’s capital of fashion and style, but many retail businesses in the city cannot survive a further seven weeks under harsh lockdown after months of being closed. Nor can many restaurants or the quirky shops in the distinctive lanes.
The Andrews road map fails to provide that elusive ingredient vital to recoveries — confidence. The non-plan lacks the hope and optimism required, as Australian Industry Group chief Innes Willox said, along with clear, measurable steps for businesses to open up. The road map will compound economic, health and social damage. During his Sunday press conference, Mr Andrews denied he was pursuing a strategy to eliminate rather than suppress coronavirus. That’s not how it appeared, however, with moves to open up in earnest hingeing on daily case numbers falling to less than five. He apologised, as well he might, for “the circumstances we find ourselves in’’. These arose out of his government’s failures over hotel quarantining. It is impossible to wish the problem away. But heavy-handed big government will exacerbate the devastation it was designed to fix.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
WE SAY Back to school a sensible way to slowly begin	The New Zealand Herald	If we all keep following rules there is a better chance of a ‘new normal’
The immediate area of the Government’s focus as it responds to the Covid-19 pandemic in past weeks has, of course, been health.
Now that we appear to be tracking on the right path in that area — with daily new case numbers in the single figures, border closures and quarantines in place, and increased testing and tracing showing minimal community transmission — the focus turns to the economy as the Government looks to open up New Zealand to business. In turn, this leads to education, to enable workers’ children to return to the classroom and begin the equally important business of learning again.
This week, as we exit alert level 4 and our month-long lockdown, there is a notable feeling of — if not full-blown excitement, given the still-tight restrictions — anticipation certainly. Yet it is clear for parents, caregivers and education providers gearing up to open the school gates, there is also much anxiety in the mix, too.
This is understandable. For the past month we have been programmed to fear this unseen killer that has caused so much loss and heartache overseas in particular. We have made major and fundamental changes to the way in which we live, work, study and interact in an effort to combat the spread of the virus here. The messaging has been — and continues to be in large part — act as if you have Covid-19 and everyone around you has Covid-19.
It is a huge turnaround to start relaxing that thinking — even only slightly and even if we are desperate to do so.
Parents are rightly anxious about sending their precious offspring back out into a world that many of us adults are still not venturing fully out into. Schools and early childhood centres are rightly worried about being able to ensure the health and safety of their young charges and staff alike. And — as was apparent in the early days of alert level 4 — there has been some confusion about the risks, rules and expectations of a new alert level.
The Government and health and education ministry officials have been working on ways to mitigate the physical health risks, and balance them against the flipsides: the potential psychological risks of keeping children in lockdown too long, the long-term impact on children’s learning and progress, and the need for parents to get back to work.
Children have not been immune to the virus and there have been child deaths associated with it. Yet Education Minister Chris Hipkins and director general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield say the international experience so far is that the health risk to youngsters is generally low and the impact on those infected generally far less severe than on adults and the elderly. In New Zealand’s case, the rate of community transmission of the virus is now very low, and that gives reassurance it is safe for limited numbers of children to return to education facilities — with precautionary measures in place.
Not all epidemiologists and academics agree, saying more evidence is required. One worry is the extent to which children can convey the virus to adults, particularly the elderly, who are the most likely to get very sick and die from the virus. That will be something people looking to expand their family bubbles in alert level 3 should take into consideration.
The Early Childhood Council wants centres to stay closed until alert level 2. At Morrinsville College (Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s old school), principal John Inger has accused the Government of forcing teachers to be “child-minders” and warning of the “potential disaster” of schools becoming “incubators for the virus”. But the Auckland Primary Principals’ Association says all its schools will be opening and it believes the national sentiment is largely to do the same.
We have to start somewhere. A partial opening — up to year 10 inclusive and largely for the children of essential workers and others who must return to work — is a sensible way to begin.
While the Government clearly desires teachers back in classrooms, Hipkins says he will not “force” early childhood centres to open under alert level 3. That flexibility is welcome.
Children pick up on the stress and anxiety of adults around them. If a facility is not ready to welcome kids back, and not comfortable doing so, it is perhaps better for all involved that it doesn’t open. But many are willing and able to do so. If centres and schools can implement the desired measures effectively — the likes of small bubbles, distancing where possible, strict hygiene practices and cleaning routines, contact tracing — there is every reason kids will readily adopt the new norm. After all, they are remarkably resilient. If essential and other returning workers need to be able to send their children back to the classroom, they should feel reassured the measures are designed to keep their kids safe.
All parents must now play their part. The Government recognises there will be some who need to take advantage of the partial education opening. But the messaging is that parents who can keep their kids learning at home should do so. An expanded bubble with a caregiver may help with that. Those parents who do send their kids back into education facilities must ensure sick children stay at home, and that family bubbles are strictly maintained outside the classroom, as are good hygiene practices.
Like a toddler’s first steps, these first few days back in the old school yard may feel a bit shaky, but if we all continue to follow the rules there is a better chance of the country getting up and running and moving into a “new normal” as soon as possible.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Levelling with Australians about hard reforms ahead	The Australian	If we can get economy out of slow lane, budget will follow
In normal times, which in the era of COVID-19 means “not now”, a mini-budget would see analysts scouring the assumptions behind forecasts for iron ore prices, economic growth, revenue and spending. Are they too optimistic? The pandemic makes forecasting more difficult, if not almost meaningless. Few readers will have forgotten Treasury’s wild miss in costing the initial phase of the JobKeeper wage subsidy at $130bn for six months, covering six million workers. The econocrats, chastened, revised it to $70bn after the take-up rate was just over half of what was expected. The Economic and Fiscal Update on Thursday by Josh Frydenberg and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann is based on Victoria’s lockdown lasting six weeks, success in suppressing the virus and adherence to the three-step reopening elsewhere, and a return of some international travel in January.
That may be a heroic call given the outbreak in Greater Melbourne and likely additional restrictions if case numbers don’t improve soon. What underpins hopes of steady reopening of the economy is that citizens will adhere to social distancing, practise good hygiene, get tested and self-isolate, and that contact tracing can cope with a spike in infections. In the presentation, the Treasurer highlighted Australia’s solid medical performance, compared with other nations, as well as our relative economic strength. It was a pep talk, for sure, to keep the faith and set off for a climb up the mountain in front of us. Yet things are going to get worse. The headline unemployment rate is expected to peak at 9.25 per cent in the December quarter; the budget deficit is set to rise from $85.8bn last financial year to $184.5bn this financial year.
It’s going to be a bumpy ride, as Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe warned this week, with some driving in heavy fog. In calendar 2020, even with mammoth stimulus spending, Treasury is forecasting gross domestic product to plunge by 3.75 per cent, before rising by 2.5 per cent the year after. Of course, without the injection of $289bn, or 14.6 per cent of GDP, the economy would be cactus. Keeping people close to home has produced a rebound in household spending. But the battering of business confidence and continuing uncertain outlook are hurting investment and that will be a handbrake on how fast we can grow when the crisis passes.
The Morrison government has to walk a fine line in its messaging. While there’s probably no better place to be than Australia during the pandemic, as the Treasurer claimed, many families are hurting; when income supports are reduced and policy struts possibly taken away, there will be a brisk reckoning for companies, sole traders, breadwinners and the jobless. The strength of public finances, and the government’s willingness to spend, means it can keep running up a tab as long as it sticks to its principles of targeted, temporary and proportionate assistance. Giving is much easier than taking things away. Reducing Canberra’s footprint won’t be a popular selling point as we approach the runway to the next election.
The October 6 budget is the main event, a daunting task for the Treasurer. There are so many important moving parts beyond mere taxing and spending — reducing regulation, restructuring industries, cutting energy costs and making workplaces more flexible — that raise the degree of difficulty. As budget maven Chris Richardson noted after the update, the government not only has to “go hard” in doing whatever it takes to deal with the fallout, it has to “go smart” to implement reforms that get the economy fit and increase our growth rate. That’s where the politics of lowering tax or reducing union control are not only tough but, as the past decade shows, also toxic. For those alarmed by huge deficits and rising debt, expected to hit a gross $850bn, Mr Richardson says if we can get the economy right, the budget will follow.
That’s what the Treasurer’s policy marketing needs to focus on. By all means, let’s talk up our resilience and sacrifices, our solid fundamentals and wonderful endowments, but it’s time to break the news to Australians about reform priorities. There will be more disruption, not less, as the economy emerges from this induced calamity due to a viral shock. Mr Frydenberg must pursue policies that enhance how we use our precious capital, remove impediments to expansion, hiring and innovation, and level with Australians about how we earn our way. Revival has to be led by business, not the state’s heavy hand. Again, this won’t be easy to pull off with a defective, hyper-partisan national parliament and a flighty media animated by Twitter hit squads. The Treasurer will get pushback from within Coalition ranks, too, if he is serious about ending the grift, rent seeking and awful waste in Canberra. The communications blitz also has to be carried by Scott Morrison and his frontline ministers of the pandemic response. Our vigilance on suppressing COVID-19, and living with it wisely until a vaccine emerges, waxes and wanes. Complacency can creep in, as can confusion, given states and territories are at different stages of social restrictions and activity. There can be no confidence, no sustained job creation and no meaningful recovery until the medical crisis subsides. We can win skirmishes against COVID-19, but not the war if we don’t stay smart on suppression and get momentum back into the economy. If we can achieve those rosy assumptions on reopening of workplaces and borders, and not get stuck in a stop-go-stop-go wash cycle, we’ll get Australia back on the fast track and, at some point this decade, the federal budget back in the black.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp

Henry Parkes, veteran premier of the colony of NSW and champion of Federation, declared in 1890: “The time has now arrived when we are no longer separated. The crimson thread of kinship runs through us all.” He was harking back to the distinct origins and colonial rivalries of NSW, Victoria and Queensland, but more than a century later we are discovering — amid pandemic crisis and dislocation — a strange and unsettling sense of separation forced upon us as Australians. Of course, we remain a political union — one in theory brought closer by a national cabinet — but our economy and society are fragmented by erratic state border closures.
Scott Morrison was right to focus minds on unity by year’s end, when he said in September: “What we have to work to do is to let Australians know that, by Christmas, they will be able to come together. By Christmas, they will be able to come together as families and look to a 2021 that doesn’t look like the difficulties that they’ve gone through in 2020.” That festival is symbolic of scattered family and friends making the effort to come together. For morale, hope and effective public policy, it’s vital to have a goal and a set date. But the disproportionate financial and human costs of lockdown and poorly thought-through border closures are becoming more obvious by the day.
It’s time to get moving, and NSW, the state that Parkes did so much to bring to life, should take the initiative. Gladys Berejiklian has rightly earned plaudits as the most pragmatic and effective premier in responding to COVID-19 while keeping the state, its businesses, family life and social activities as open as possible. Remember, this is not a crude trade-off between money and lives. A lockdown more severe than is necessary to cope with COVID also costs lives, damages the social fabric and harms wellbeing. Jobs, productive work and income are enmeshed with individual dignity and communal vitality.
With some exemptions, the NSW-Victoria land border was sealed for the first time in living memory in July. Separating our two biggest state populations and economies, it is symbolically the most important border in the nation. It should be reopened immediately. This is a moment of truth for Ms Berejiklian to act decisively and show national leadership, in the spirit of our Federation’s founders. We must start to unravel the mess of micromanaged but often inconsistent and irrational restrictions on movement across the country, restrictions which very few people can comprehend or keep track of. Some cases of unintended tragedy have been well publicised: the northern NSW mother with pregnancy complications who was denied entry to Queensland and lost one of her twins after having to fly to Sydney; and the Canberra nurse who was kept by border red-tape from her father’s funeral service in Brisbane. But there are myriad other stories of absurdity and hardship, especially in country towns close to state borders, and the restrictions often seem arbitrary rather than lifesaving.
In Queensland and Western Australia — both states with long isolationist traditions — premiers have represented border closures as public health imperatives, clearly tapping into a fearful fortress mentality. Although chief medical officers rightly have input into such decisions, they are ultimately political in the sense that they require accountable leaders to balance competing values and interests. It’s no coincidence that reopening of the NSW-Queensland border has been floated as possible for November 1, the day after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk receives the verdict of voters in the Queensland election. At the weekend, she was still pitching to that old sentiment of self-enclosed Queensland with her rebuke aimed at “voices from the South and the Deep South” urging her to lift the barricades.
In Western Australia, Premier Mark McGowan also held out against a timely, co-ordinated re-opening across the country. In truth, it’s in the enduring interests of every state and territory to revive a national, COVID-safe economy as soon as possible. We face a grim enough recession already without baking in more misery. The emotional investment of family reunion and economic stimulus of interstate travel go hand-in-hand. Cities and regions desperately need the inflow of visitors. Denied international arrivals for now, tourism can offset its losses with custom from Australians whose inability to go overseas is creating pent-up demand for domestic destinations. This is especially important for Victoria, where lockdown is having a catastrophic effect on businesses, jobs, psychological welfare and confidence. So, it’s welcome news from Premier Dan Andrews that the extreme restrictions imposed on Victorians will begin to be loosened from tomorrow. At great cost, Victoria has sharply reduced the spread of COVID, and NSW continues to manage the outbreak well. It’s time to open up.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Time for optimism; but recovery will be a struggle	The Australian	Improving aggregate demand will drive a rebound and jobs
The fall in Victoria’s daily total of new COVID-19 cases to 14 on Sunday came at a good time. As spring warms up our second-largest city, Melburnians are eager to be out and about and the state is “a bit ahead of schedule’’ on the road to recovery, as Premier Daniel Andrews said on Sunday. Mr Andrews is not about to risk hard-won gains. But, sensibly, he has left open the option of bringing forward the easing of some restrictions. He would do well to start with Melbourne’s curfew. While Europeans gear up for a second major wave of the pandemic, Australians are in the relatively fortunate position of governments and business increasingly focused on opening up the economy.
The JobKeeper wage subsidy will be phased back from $1500 to $1200 per fortnight next week. But as Scott Morrison told the ABC on Sunday, the October 6 budget would include new measures, “which are going to be pro-boosting aggregate demand in our economy”. Income tax cuts could be brought forward with boosts to the pension, infrastructure and manufacturing. For some, such measures will be a lifeline.
The big losers as JobKeeper unwinds will be “mum-and-dad’’ businesses, with collateral in the form of the family home. During the pandemic, these enterprises have been protected by federal government changes that massively lifted the threshold for creditors to trigger insolvency proceedings. As a result, bankruptcies and insolvencies fell to their lowest levels for decades. The changes are scheduled to remain until December 31.
Many sectors will continue to do it tough well into next year and beyond. The pandemic could cut demand for new houses and apartments by up to 230,000 over the next three years, as Adam Creighton writes on Monday. Between March and July rental listings more than doubled in parts of inner Melbourne and Sydney, and increased 60 per cent in central Brisbane. Advertised rents in Melbourne’s CBD have dropped more than 20 per cent, and by almost 25 per cent in Sydney’s inner east. In sections of the property sector, much will depend on the timing of international border reopenings, the return of overseas students and the resumption of immigration, which has accounted for 59 per cent of Australia’s population growth since 2007.
The positive news, Creighton reports in Business Review on Monday, is that the expected avalanche of corporate insolvencies and personal bankruptcies next year will have less impact on banks than in previous recessions. Analysis by bank expert Matthew Wilson puts likely credit losses over the next two years at $45bn, less than the losses incurred during the 2008 financial crisis and less than a quarter of the losses experienced in the early 1990s. The predictions reflect the fact that large corporations are in a stronger position than they were during the 2008 global financial crisis and the recession of the early 1990s. The steady improvement in Victoria should help reopen the economy and provide workers with security, as Josh Frydenberg said on Sunday. An acceleration out of stage-four restrictions should also help prevent Christmas shortages in the retail sector. The nation’s largest transport and logistics company, Toll Holdings, has warned that containers abandoned at wharves and staffing shortages in warehouses risked supply problems. As Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Paul Guerra says, the road map for opening up needs to be brought forward in a “strategic, health-focused and well-managed way”.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Red ink to flow with high hopes	The Australian	In a crisis, budgets demand vision that is bold and rational “After a decade of budget deficits, Josh Frydenberg will tonight announce the days of red ink and fiscal rage are finally over,’’ last year’s pre-budget editorial tipped. It was a different world. On Tuesday at 7pm, in the wake of a once-in-a-century (we hope) pandemic, a torrent of red ink will flow from the despatch box, for good reason — to create the conditions for recovery by boosting business and consumer confidence, investment, spending and jobs. The nation’s official debt ceiling will be lifted beyond $1.1 trillion dollars, as Simon Benson reports on Monday. The deficit will balloon to $210bn. For all this, our gross debt-to-GDP ratio of about 55 per cent, the highest since the 1950s, will remain one of the lowest among developed countries.
In all this, the flicker of fiscal prudence is not forgotten. “Jobs recovery itself will repair the budget,’’ Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Sunday. It will help, over what will be a long, slow process. Budget measures announced or expected are wide-ranging — subsidising half the wages of 100,000 apprentices from October 5, bringing forward generous personal tax cuts, a boost for pensioners and investment in manufacturing and technology. The plan to extend the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme to an extra 10,000 first-home buyers who will be able to buy newly built homes with low deposits will be popular with some. But it has the potential to distort the market with unforeseen consequences. More importantly for jobs and removing future capacity constraints, another $7.5bn will be spent on transport infrastructure. Following reports the McGowan government in Western Australia is set to return a $1.7bn surplus for 2019-20 in its budget on Thursday, Senator Cormann was right to argue the states, including WA, should do more to support jobs and business. In August, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe told the states they should effectively double outlays on infrastructure by spending an extra­ $40bn, especially on smaller projects that create jobs. Given the seismic shift in the nation’s financial position and a sensible recovery plan, avoiding more waves of COVID-19 will be critical.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Beijing’s regime reverts to type	The Australian	In denying a pandemic probe, China risks becoming a pariah
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s claim there is “enormous evidence” COVID-19 originated in a Wuhan research lab underlines the need for global pressure on obdurate Chinese Communist Party rulers for a credible scientific probe into the pandemic. “Who on earth wouldn’t want to know where and how all this started?” Mr Pompeo asked with good reason as the total number of cases by Monday had passed 3.6 million, with 250,000 deaths, and even the smallest and most remote countries were faced with devastation due to the global economic shutdown. Who indeed? Certainly similar crises in the West that did much less damage to the world than COVID-19 would have resulted in an immediate, transparent investigation and search for answers to prevent a recurrence.
But it is a dismal reflection of the authoritarian and opaque society led by Xi Jinping and the CCP that, as Mr Pompeo said, Beijing, in resisting an investigation, is instead “attempting to conceal and hide and confuse”. China employed the World Health Organisation as a tool to do the same, he noted. “The Australians agree with that,” Mr Pompeo said, adding “the whole world is united in understanding that China brought this virus to the world”. Evidence of the oppressive state’s malign handling of what emerged in Wuhan is mounting. It adds further to the weight of evidence pointing to the CCP’s culpability for what occurred. A new US intelligence report coinciding with Mr Pompeo’s disclosure about the Wuhan lab details a cynical strategy by the CCP to cover up and dissemble the extent of the outbreak and the contagious nature of COVID-19. This was aimed at gaining time for the CCP’s lackeys to scour the world to buy up bulk medical supplies and send them back to China.
According to the report, China held off informing the WHO coronavirus was “a contagion” for much of January to allow for more time to buy up face masks, surgical gowns and gloves, including piles from Australia. The result of the delay, according to the US intelligence report, was many tens of thousands more deaths, greater economic devastation and grave personal protective equipment shortages when the world’s hospitals were flooded with COVID-19 victims. Mr Pompeo’s claim of evidence pinpointing the Wuhan lab as the virus’s source is at variance with what has been the conclusion of most experts that it emerged from the city’s wildlife wet markets. That does not change the need for CCP leaders to stop behaving like the rulers of a rogue state and to co-operate in allowing a full investigation into the pandemic’s origins.China has been massively damaged. The CCP claims barely credible low case numbers and deaths resulting from what started in Wuhan. But what Mr Xi and his fellow rulers need to realise is China’s standing has been tarnished across the world. Their much-vaunted “face mask diplomacy” in brazenly boasting of their success in fighting COVID-19 and supplying desperately needed PPE (much of it found to be defective) to countries battling the virus doesn’t change the need for urgent answers. Like the rest of the world, the Chinese themselves surely want more than the CCP’s high-handed refusal to help in facilitating an independent scientific investigation. The Chinese leadership would be wise not to misconstrue the depth of feeling across the world towards the CCP’s malign handling of a crisis that began in Wuhan. If it does not respond to the legitimate global concerns seeking answers to the pandemic’s origins, it could find itself being regarded as a pariah state by much of the world.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Mining can lead economic surge after the pandemic	The Australian	In maintaining operations, the sector is helping the nation
The lowering COVID-19 infection rate is turning attention to how and when we will emerge from economic hibernation. The reduction in the rate of new diagnoses is promising, especially compared with the disasters besetting most G20 nations. Lives are being protected because the majority of Australians are doing the right thing, even amid glorious Easter weather. For now, we must continue to do so to avert the risk of a spike in the caseload.
Unemployment figures to be released on Thursday will be an indication of the damage that the shutdowns prompted by coronavirus have done to the economy so far. However bleak the picture, the public can take confidence from the ongoing success of the nation’s most important export industry — resources. As Dennis Shanahan and Paul Garvey report on Monday, Australia’s economic backbone not only remains intact, it is gaining strength.
Parts of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, as well as supermarkets, chemists and healthcare are also proving resilient, Josh Frydenberg told The Australian. Activity in those sectors will be a solid platform in however many months when the economy begins gearing up towards full throttle, allowing business and individual taxpayers to set about generating the wealth that will be needed to pay down the deficit and debt incurred during the pandemic. As The Australian has argued from the outset, when the crisis passes, big government must retreat. The Morrison government will need to be ready, as soon as circumstances permit, to turn off its temporary measures, step out of the way and let business flourish.
Australia is fortunate to have such a dynamic and diverse resources and energy sector that will be central to recovery. Despite much of the world being crippled by COVID-19, resource and energy export earnings are on track for a record $299bn windfall in 2019-20. That is $18bn more than forecast in December. Strong iron ore prices, a spike in the gold price induced by the virus and a decline in the Australian dollar are driving the increase. The McGowan government’s decision to classify mining as “essential” in Western Australia, allowing it to continue operating through the pandemic, was the right call. Iron ore production and jobs are being maintained, with exports on track to break records. In dollar terms, the iron ore price is higher than at almost any time since early 2014, boosting governments’ depleted coffers. Australia’s mineral exports are also being boosted by mine closures in South America, Mongolia and South Africa. Coal exports were up 3 per cent in the March quarter over last year.
The efficiency and resilience of the resources sector, which had longstanding contingency plans for global pandemics in place, is working to the benefit of the nation. Border shutdowns and travel limits have cut the number of interstate fly-in, fly-out workers from more than 10,000 to less than 1200 in just three weeks, but work is continuing. Like all industries, however, mining companies must be prudent in their precautions to protect staff from COVID-19. The risk has been highlighted after a BHP Mitsubishi Alliance worker tested positive to COVID-19 at Blackwater in central Queensland. As Geoff Chambers and Joe Kelly write on Monday, Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union Queensland president Stephen Smyth points out that mining sites have multiple points of potential cross-contamination. These include machinery, transport, mess facilities and accommodation.
Unlike competitor nations with mines in shutdown, Australia is well placed to meet our trading partners’ demands when their economies begin to gear up. China’s recovery from coronavirus should drive strong demand, with the Minerals Council of Australia pointing out that iron ore prices have held up in expectation that China’s forthcoming fiscal stimulus package could offer significant steel-intensive infrastructure spending. Resources Minister Keith Pitt predicts Australia’s thermal and coking coal “will literally drive the economic recovery of many Asian countries”.
Post-pandemic, nothing would assist the process of Australia’s debt recovery like a sustained minerals boom. Preoccupied as they are with dealing with the disease, federal and state governments — especially the ministers responsible for mining and infrastructure — should be looking ahead now. The beginning of the economic climb-back is almost certainly months, not years, away. But whatever immediate adjustments need to be made to remove capacity constraints should be in train now. It is also important, as Australia moves into winter, to ensure sufficient gas and electricity supplies are available to meet industrial and domestic demand.If the process of paying down the cost of the pandemic is to be shortened and the need for tax hikes reduced, governments need to be taking the long-term view of our resources industries. Years of red- and green-tape delays on project approvals must be consigned to the past; Australians need governments to enhance conditions for our strongest industries to draw investment and help rebuild the economy through royalties and taxes. The resources sector will not be our only path back. But on current performance, it will be the cornerstone of our return to prosperity.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
A complex strategic challenge	The Australian	In relating to China, Australia needs to stand its ground
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning about China ramping up its aggression in the South China Sea underlines the brazen opportunism of the Chinese Communist Party seeking to further its strategic ambitions while the world battles COVID-19.
As Amanda Hodge reported on Friday, a Chinese warship locked its radar guns on a Philippines naval vessel in an act tantamount to signalling an inbound missile. Australian Strategic Policy Institute director Peter Jennings said the incident was “a hostile act against the Philippines” that “topped the list’’ of China’s bad behaviour.
The list does not end there. China has used naval and coastguard vessels to harass Malaysian oil-exploration boats, to sink a Vietnamese fishing trawler near the disputed Paracel Islands, and to intimidate Indonesian fishing vessels. Such bullying, Euan Graham of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Singapore says, is to capitalise on the “big opening” provided by the coronavirus pandemic.
In a response last Tuesday, three warships from the US Seventh Fleet, accompanied by Australian frigate HMAS Parramatta, sailed close to the standoff between Chinese vessels and the Malaysian oil-exploration boats. More will be needed to deter Beijing’s posturing as it amplifies propaganda about the COVID-19 outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt. The aircraft carrier is a major US naval asset in the Pacific; China claims its problems with the virus are a sign of US naval vulnerability in the region.
Mr Pompeo’s warning that “Beijing has moved to take advantage of the distraction” of the pandemic has significance for the entire world. A third of global shipping, worth $US5 trillion ($7.8 trillion) a year, passes through the South China Sea. The International Court of Arbitration’s 2016 ruling concluded Chinese claims to 90 per cent of the South China Sea were without basis in law. That did not deter Beijing turning reefs and outcrops into islands and turning specks of land into bases with harbours, runways and missile batteries. Its latest forays coincide with its proclaiming new Chinese administrative districts in the occupied Paracel and Spratly Islands, despite long-time claims of ownership by Vietnam and the Philippines.
Beijing’s aggression is not confined to the South China Sea: it has also intensified its hostility towards Taiwan, which won global acclaim for its successful fight against the Wuhan virus, despite its proximity to the Chinese mainland. As Greg Sheridan wrote on Saturday, the world is entering a “dangerous period of destabilising military activity by Beijing with serious risk of miscalculation”.
In a different sphere, as revealed in The Weekend Australian Magazine, bullying was the hallmark of a spiteful campaign faced by Olympian Mack Horton and his family after the swimmer took a stand for clean sport against Chinese drug cheat Sun Yang.Australia has to be pragmatic and careful, as John Howard says. As some Coalition MPs push for the nation to become less reliant on China economically, Mr Howard, who had vast experience managing the bilateral relationship successfully, is right when he warns that turning it on its head would not serve our interests. Mr Howard backs the government’s moves to close the border to China early in the COVID-19 crisis and to pursue an independent global investigation into the origins of the virus. But, as he says, Australia has good trading and people-to-people ties with China. These should be fostered. At the same time, the US and its allies must show their resolve to protect the region has not lessened.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Understanding history to break cycle of ignorance	The Australian	In the chase for global rankings, Australian stories are lost
Tanya Plibersek’s Australia Day call to patriotism, including a proposal for the teaching of the citizenship pledge in schools, sparked a miserable backlash. For self-loathing progressives, quick to mock and slow to serve, love of country is akin to white supremacy. As the opposition education spokeswoman said in her address, patriotism is not about exclusion but an “ongoing commitment to your country — and an ongoing commitment to the people with whom you share it”. Part of that, of course, has to be deep knowledge of our history, culture, geography, laws and civics. Not because our ways are superior to those of other lands but because a proper understanding of ourselves — both good and ill — promotes solidarity, binding us in times of national need, such as the current bushfire crisis. Some of that shared knowledge is under threat, partly due to neglect, as in the dwindling number of chairs in Australian literature. But it’s largely because of fads in schools and universities, and research incentives that discourage local scholarship.
Take the case of Captain James Cook, whose ship the Endeavour landed at Botany Bay in April 1770. Fifty years ago, when the 200th anniversary of the landing took place, every school student knew something of his voyage through the South Pacific and beyond. As Geoffrey Blainey explained in Inquirer on Saturday, that anniversary, a year after the Apollo moon landing, saw Cook celebrated as “a kind of astronaut who arrived by sea”. Yet his story of courage and adventure has been subsumed in the culture and history wars. As the 250th anniversary comes into view, Cook is being honoured — and condemned — often simply due to social media tribalism.
Professor Blainey notes the public’s response reflects the tensions and hopes around indigenous affairs. Our most eminent historian says opposing arguments about Cook, in moderation, are legitimate. Cook was a giant of the sea. “To deprive him, his scientists and his crew of high praise would be mean-spirited and would mock history,” Professor Blainey argues. On the other hand, Aboriginal peoples will rightly insist that they, or people close to them in kinship, were the first discoverers of Australia. “In the early history of the land they discovered and settled they have a proud role,” Professor Blainey writes.
Australians should be able to properly appreciate the three strands of our inheritance, each intrinsic to our rich identity: Australia’s first peoples; the British settlers who followed tens of thousands of years later in 1788; and the subsequent waves and ripples of migrants from around the globe. The credulous reception of Bruce Pascoe’s bestselling book Dark Emu is an object lesson in historical illiteracy. His narrative implies that the achievement of the Aborigines has been sold short as a primitive hunter-gatherer society, and evidence of technology, such as fish traps, suppressed. But celebration of Aboriginal prehistory in all its richness stretches back to the 1960s. Today’s schoolteachers need to rediscover Professor Blainey’s 1975 book Triumph of the Nomads. We live in an age of laziness, mischief and forgetting.
Writing in our pages on Monday, Education Minister Dan Tehan called for a better understanding of “who we are, where we have come from and the events that have shaped us”. Rather than people telling us what to think, we need the knowledge, tools and the curiosity to help us join the dots about our past. “Knowledge of our history will help us break the cycle of Australia Day antagonism,” Mr Tehan argued. “Reconciliation will not come from ignorance.” The minister proposes to spend $12m to fund 40 individual projects to focus on Australian studies. Between 2011 and 2020, only 3 per cent of taxpayer-funded grants under our main competitive grant scheme — the Australian Research Council’s Discovery Grants — were in the areas of Australian society, history or culture.
This carve-out of funds to dig deeper into ourselves, to question and critique, to explore and to preserve, is welcome. As this newspaper has reported over several years, some of our best minds have lost their bearings — as has the ARC process. Mr Tehan’s predecessor vetoed $4.1m of ARC-approved university research grants covering exotic topics such as a history of men’s dress, gender norms in China and “post-orientalist arts in the Strait of ­Gibraltar”. Nice work, if you have tenure. That decision fed outrage among those in the ivory trough but also led to a national interest test for future grants, another layer of messy bureaucracy to de-silly the academy. We do not believe governments should decide on the merit of research but should step in when common sense fails or the structure is out of whack.The cultural cringe is alive and kicking. University chiefs are chasing global rankings. One of the key ways universities receive recognition is from the quality and quantity of research published in prestigious international journals. As Mr Tehan noted, this incentivises local academics to study topics with a global bent likely to appeal to an international editor; inquiry into uniquely Australian topics is viewed as second-class. Fewer teachers, students and institutions are drawn to the field, leading to “a downward spiral” in the area, argues the minister. The special research initiative is an important signal, a move that will swing the pendulum back to the scholarship that underpins our unity, tolerance, respect and resilience. We must keep telling our stories to keep them honest and alive. As we deepen our understanding of the past, we strengthen the bonds we share and rely on to thrive.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Robertson faces big challenge	The New Zealand Herald	In the opening months of the coalition’s term of Government, Grant Robertson’s forays into guest speaking at corporate events could be awkward to watch.
Whereas his predecessors Bill English and Steven Joyce were usually fawned over by business figures, question and answer sessions with Robertson tended to involve lengthy pauses as the director community looked at their shoes as they digested lunch.
How the passage of time, amid concerns of the impact of Covid-19, have changed this.
This morning Robertson will speak to the Wellington Chamber of Commerce at a time when much of the economy is looking to him for a plan to cushion New Zealand from whatever disruption the novel coronavirus sends our way.
How Robertson responds is likely to play a significant role both in September’s election, but more importantly, in the economy’s ability to deliver jobs and incomes for New Zealand.
With the number of cases of the virus in New Zealand appearing to be contained for now, concerns about how this will impact jobs are not.
So far the impacts have been limited outside key tourism areas, international education and major export industries, but the possible effects for smaller businesses could be widespread.
There are specific concerns that the coming months will see a shortage of refrigerated shipping containers in this part of the world, threatening our ability to get perishable goods to market.
Robertson’s position is far from hopeless; as he has long been saying, New Zealand has low unemployment and low public debt. His fiscal responsibility rules were developed for normal economic times with the caveat that they could be relaxed or abandoned in the event of a global shock.
However Covid-19 affects our economy, no one will question that this is a global event.
But the finance minister does face a challenge which has dogged his Government: matching expectations with reality.
New Zealand’s government debt levels might be low, making the scale of the potential response large, but the potential scale of the issue could be bigger than the public will tolerate.
On Monday, Robertson raised the idea of the Government stepping in to provide temporary working capital if banks are unwilling to.
This alone could put billions of dollars of taxpayers money at risk in private enterprise. It may also be crucial to help re-establish supply chains.
A bigger problem is the issue of equity, with the impact of Covid-19 on business certain to be unevenly distributed. Separately, as cruel as it sounds, poor businesses should be allowed to fail.
It will be nearly impossible for Robertson to create a business continuity package which does not either exclude some businesses which are legitimately impacted by the virus, or cushion others which were struggling anyway.
Time is not on his side, with the impact on some industries into a second month, and larger problems looming.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

It will be nearly impossible for Robertson to create a business continuity package which does not either exclude some businesses which are legitimately impacted by the virus, or cushion others which were struggling anyway. — NZ Herald	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Arrogant China shows its contempt for fair trading	The Australian	India will be an essential partner in the post-pandemic world The imposition of an 80 per cent tariff on our barley is a miserable result — for China. Importers, such as brewers, will pay the impost; they’ll pass it on to customers. For world-famous Tsingtao, it’s a dilemma: pay more, or opt for lower-quality homegrown or imported malting barley. Either way, Tsingtao just became a lot less competitive in the global beer market. Australian farmers are victims, too, punished for their export success. This is a lose-lose result, however arbitrary and vindictive. If not barley, it would be another crop. Beijing has been humiliated during the pandemic, its reputation tarnished. How do you shrink a nation of 1.4 billion? The Chinese Communist Party is taking care of that. “Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!” Shelley wrote of the fallen Ozymandias, with his “sneer of cold command”.
Retribution aside, China’s case against us on barley is dishonest. Its claim that our growers are subsidised, citing Murray-Darling Basin support as evidence, is a crock. Almost 90 per cent of barley exported to China comes from Western Australia. For a nation slowly gobbling up our prime farmland, this is a poor understanding of terrain. With parts of Australia experiencing their worst drought conditions, many families on the land have had to rely on off-farm income or welfare payments to survive. We’ll certainly take our case to the World Trade Organisation. But action will take years. Growers will no doubt look for market gaps created by China’s ploy, with opportunities most likely in Vietnam, Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia. Or they’ll switch to canola, pulses or wheat. This is unfair and malign, but likely to be a regular feature of the CCP playbook as it settles scores and intimidates its way through the wreckage, boundless and bare, of coronavirus.
Such behaviour invites us to reflect on the comprehensive strategic partnership we sealed with China in 2014, based on goodwill, trust and mutual benefit. That was a high point, to be sure, the diligent work of officials, political leaders and companies over a decade. Imperfect as it is — financial and professional services were carved out — the free-trade agreement opened the door for many. Exports to China boomed, led by iron ore, coal, natural gas, education and tourism. China accounts for 28 per cent of foreigners studying here. It’s the largest source of tourists; their spending is equal to the next four countries. All up, China buys 32.6 per cent of our exports, the same as total sales to our next five top markets — Japan, South Korea, the US, India and New Zealand. Investment platforms send customers an alert when a listed security exceeds 15 per cent of a portfolio. Canberra, we have a problem.
Diversifying our trade is prudent. But decoupling from China, as some would wish, is risky. Trade is mutually beneficial. Our big companies and producers want to be in China, with its voracious appetite for reliably supplied raw materials and aspirational products — from prestigious degrees and unique travel experiences, to safe baby formula and fine wines. As China gets richer, it will want more of these goods and services, which we produce at a winning nexus of price and quality. These competitive advantages pay for China’s exports to our shore. Long may this self-interest and free exchange prosper. Yet the disruptions to supply chains from COVID-19 will see nations, big and small, seeking self-sufficiency for all manner of products. That’s a pity, yet understandable. This retreat from globalisation will obviously hurt trade, growth, investment and productivity. It will impose a heavy constraint on China, the factory of the world.
China’s capricious tariff decision, too, will have ripple effects; it’s a reality check for us, and other nations, and a nudge to broaden our horizons. As Ben Packham reports on Wednesday, Scott Morrison will use a virtual summit with India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, on June 4 to push ahead with plans to diversify our relationships. Canberra and New Delhi will cement new agreements to develop trusted supply chains in strategic sectors including medical goods, technology and minerals. A new defence partnership is in the works, while fresh research co-operation will help to deepen education ties, reducing the university sector’s reliance on Chinese students. Our trade with India, a nation with almost as many people as China, is underdone; India takes 4.9 per cent of our exports, with a growing number of tourists and students coming here. Many settle in Australia, enriching our culture and lifting our skills base. India has a tiny share of our imports, less than one-tenth of the value of China’s sales. The only way is up. Mr Morrison, who cancelled a scheduled visit there due to the Black Summer bushfires, said India, with its shared values, is a “natural partner for Australia”. India will be essential to us in the post-pandemic world. Former Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade head Peter Varghese, author of a landmark 2018 report into the bilateral relationship, is right: we need to spread the trade risk, find new markets and constrain China’s ambitions to be the predominant global power. As Shelley observed of the ancient King of Kings, China’s “frown, and wrinkled lip” have been exposed.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Energy Security Board lifts red flag on renewables	The Australian	Industry and all levels of government must co-operate on electricity
Finally, there is acknowledgment that Australia’s electricity system has suffered through a combination of denial about the shortcomings of weather-dependent sources of renewable energy and policy misadventure by governments eager to showcase their green credentials. The warnings of engineers, that intermittent generation cannot maintain the national electricity grid as it was built, have been proven correct. The latest report from the Energy Security Board has thrown up a red flag that warrants deep reflection.
It would have been sensible, clearly, to start the reconfiguration of Australia’s power system with a firm plan on how it would work. Instead, there has been a chaotic and contested process of undermining the existing system using public subsidies without proper regard for what ultimately will replace it. The warning from the ESB that urgent action is required is not yet backed up with detail about exactly what actions are needed or even what technologies will be available. Instead, there are vague references to making sure that all consumers are able to participate both as power providers and consumers.
The federal government’s technology road map points to a future with more storage and new technologies including hydrogen. But these technologies are not there yet and decisions must be made soon on what is going to replace the coal-fired power that at times provides up to 80 per cent of demand. Pumped hydro, including Snowy 2.0, is a drop in the bucket of what will be required. The ESB report makes clear there is a prospect that existing coal generators may have to retire earlier than expected because of unsustainable price pressures from the influx of renewables. The challenge is for industry and governments to agree a way forward that does not result in higher prices for consumers or Australia’s heavy industry being forced to move offshore. Admitting the problem is a first step. Deciding what to do is more difficult, particularly when industry participants and various levels of government cannot agree.
The ESB remains fully committed to Australia’s transition to low carbon dioxide emissions. ESB chairwoman Kerry Schott says the transition to date has resulted in emissions being cut by about 25 per cent from 2005 levels. She says: “By 2030 those emissions will be between 40 and 60 per cent lower than 2005. And between 70 and 95 per cent lower by 2042.” Given the experience to date, however, the problems identified will get only worse as the percentage of intermittent generation in the system increases. Dr Schott concedes there has been an “exponential increase of system instability in recent years”. She says the energy sector was slow to deal with the reality that power systems with rising levels of intermittent, weather-driven generation are simply harder to manage. It is more difficult, she says, to maintain security and reliability with more variable generation: “Years of insufficient action in the face of this fact (have) cost us.” While there is broad agreement about the issues that need to be tackled, there are conflicting views on how this should be done or what technologies should play a part. A credible road map is urgently needed that can bring industry and all levels of governments to the table. The National Electricity Market, which covers all states bar Western Australia, is now a national market in name only. State governments effectively have extended the federal renewable energy target by entering power purchase agreements with renewable energy companies. No one seems to know the answer to what will happen when the coal-fired generators have gone. It is hard to see how future coal-fired plants will find financial backers. The federal government is right to keep the gas option alive as a transition. Alternatives of battery storage and hydrogen may have potential but they are unlikely to be available at sufficient scale and low enough price anytime soon. This leaves complex systems of solar micro-grids and demand management arrangements that pay consumers and industry not to use power. There is also nuclear, a technology that has been identified globally as an essential part of a low-emissions power supply future. It is a key part of US president-elect Joe Biden’s Green New Deal. It is a sobering fact that the loudest voices against nuclear have been those that have claimed, erroneously, that a renewable energy transition will be cheap, reliable and effectively pain-free.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Immigration sweet spot to enhance skills and growth	The Australian	Infrastructure provision will take heat out of a divisive issue A week ago at the National Press Club, Scott Morrison was asked what role migration would play in the recovery. The Prime Minister drew on the work of demographer Peter McDonald. He said “the great professor” envisaged a net overseas migration target of between about 160,000 and 210,000 — the number you need here to maintain per capita growth in gross domestic product. Last financial year, migration added 240,000 to our population. Next year the government expects this to drop to about 35,000, which would be the lowest intake in 40 years. “There’s obviously a big gap there,” Mr Morrison said. “Now, that’s a short-term gap, but it’s going to be one of the real impacts of this crisis because our borders aren’t opening up any time soon.” We are a long way from what the Prime Minister, a former immigration minister and treasurer, has described as Professor McDonald’s “sweet spot” on migration. In recent years, migrants — including temporary visa holders such as students and specialist workers — have made up two-thirds of overall population growth, increasing demand in a sluggish economy, including for housing, financial services, education and consumables. As Stephen Lunn reported on Monday, the suspension of the immigration pipeline is shrinking the economy by up to $40bn a year. Migrants, or the “people power” behind our decades-long “economic miracle”, as Deloitte’s Chris Richardson put it, add around 2 per cent to our $2 trillion economy. Citing Treasury work, Population Minister Alan Tudge said about 20 per cent of our GDP per capita growth during the past 40 years had been due to population growth.
Yet it’s not only the sheer number; skilled, job-ready migrants boost both productivity and participation, key drivers of the government’s recovery plan. Economists and migration experts argue a staged return that prioritises migrants with in-demand skills could help revive industries crippled by shortages of skilled workers. This could also reinvigorate the housing sector, a focus of the Morrison government’s next round of fiscal stimulus. As well, as Professor McDonald tells Lunn on Tuesday, an underused pool of at least 150,000 workers already in the country could help fill, with a few policy tweaks, the skills gap being created by the international border closure. That number includes graduates and spouses of residents on temporary visas. We need to retain such high-value workers with the right skills for the revamped, post-COVID economy.
As recruiters point out, displaced workers in hospitality or retail can’t simply move into areas of acute need such as healthcare, social assistance, ICT, mining, professional, scientific and technical. Skills aside, and the time required to retrain, such workers may have neither the inclination nor ability. Bemoaning the lack of job training by universities in the face of mass underemployment will gather traction but is often beside the point. Spouting “Australia First”, as Labor and other chancers have done recently, is self-defeating at best, nativist at worst. The regions are crying out for people, especially the young and skilled. Towns offer affordable living and unique experiences. As the shutdown shows, hi-tech workers and specialists no longer need to be in CBDs. Some work, such as healthcare, is site specific; luckily, migrants are filling this need in remote and rural areas. The crisis is a chance for us to lift our game in winning skilled migrants. Our success in dealing with coronavirus will increase our attractiveness for foreign students and young professionals. We just need to be strategic rather than haphazard in our approach. Not only to population but also to land-use planning, housing, transport and infrastructure provision. “Big Australia” is great for business because it means more customers; those with assets and capital receive a boost in prices. But for many living in outer suburbia, it has come to mean road congestion, long travel times and high housing costs. Getting the basics right for a higher population remains a challenge across all three tiers of government. But it is not a Ponzi scheme, as some sceptics aver. The pay-off from migrants is not simply in GDP growth and living standards, or even in a slowing of the ageing process. It’s all around us — in diverse and vibrant families and communities. As we emerge from the crisis, we have a fresh chance to embolden what we’ve built, take the heat out of the policy debate and beat the global competition.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Posturing on US ‘war crimes’	The Australian	International Criminal Court embarks on dangerous course
More than the “self-harm” mentioned by Alexander Downer will result from the International Criminal Court’s decision to investigate alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan. By embarking on a process that will also probe alleged Taliban war crimes, the court has sought to establish a moral and legal equivalence between the actions of the two main sides in the Afghan conflict that is as disgraceful as it is far removed from reality. At immense cost after 9/11, the US and its allies, including Australia, ousted al-Qa’ida, liberated Afghanistan’s people — particularly its long-oppressed women — from obscurantist, medieval rule, and spent billions rebuilding its education and health systems and infrastructure.
In contrast, the Taliban has killed tens of thousands of Afghan civilians in terrorist attacks that had respected defence research group Jane’s labelling it “the world’s most deadly terrorist group”, supplanting Islamic State. In 2018, Jane’s says, Taliban attacks rose 86 per cent and 4617 “non-militants” were murdered. Yet somehow the ICC reckons the US and the Taliban are on a par when it comes to investigation of alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. As Mr Downer said, the ICC’s decision will undermine its credibility and lend weight to claims it has been captured by anti-American activists.Since it was established in 2002 with a mandate to investigate genocide and other crimes against humanity, the ICC has focused on Africa, but it has also followed the well-worn path of UN-linked bodies and prioritised claims against Israel over alleged war crimes, as well as the US and its allies. In a letter to independent MP Andrew Wilkie in February, the ICC prosecutor’s office said our offshore detention regime was “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” and “unlawful under international law”. It stopped short of deciding to prosecute the government. The ICC’s Afghanistan probe is not expected to have any direct bearing on Canberra, which is pursuing a series of investigations into alleged war crimes committed by Australian troops, but, having signed on to the ICC in 2002, that should not diminish Australian concern about the dangerous and misguided course on which the ICC has embarked.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Moore-Gilbert’s release a diplomatic feat well done	The Australian	Iran remains a threat to Middle East and world stability Australians would be as one in rejoicing at the release of academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert from imprisonment in Iran. In a grim year of pandemic and rising great power tensions, Dr Moore-Gilbert’s release is a bright spot. Considerable credit is due to the Morrison government and to Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials for painstakingly maintaining the sensitive dialogue with Iran, and for behind-the-scenes efforts throughout the affair. As Ben Packham and Richard Ferguson report, the head of Australia’s intelligence community, Nick Warner, led a secret year-long effort to secure Dr Moore-Gilbert’s release in a prisoner swap deal with Iran. Mr Warner used back-channel contacts to negotiate with the Iranian regime, while Australian ambassador to Thailand Allan McKinnon lobbied Thai officials to release three Iranian terrorists to exchange for the University of Melbourne lecturer. Dr Moore-Gilbert was serving 10 years on trumped-up espionage charges.
Particular credit is due to Mr Warner and Mr McKinnon. Mr Warner served as Australia’s ambassador in Tehran in the mid-1990s and has maintained key relationships with Iran’s ruling elite. The Thai-speaking Mr McKinnon — a former deputy chief of Operation Sovereign Borders — also played an integral role in the strategy, which was hatched at least 12 months ago.
Scott Morrison expressed relief on Thursday at the end of Dr Moore-Gilbert’s 804-day ordeal, much of it in conditions Australians would regard as subhuman. But the Prime Minister wisely refused to confirm that the Iranian terrorists released by Thailand — who were serving sentences for the attempted murder of Israeli diplomats in 2012 — were swapped for Dr Moore-Gilbert. Commenting on the circumstances of her release, as Mr Morrison said, could endanger “the Australians who may from time to time find themselves in this situation”. Another sovereign state making a decision about the release of prisoners is a matter for them, he insisted. But in reiterating warnings to Australians not to travel to Iran, Mr Morrison and Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne revealed a glimpse of the realpolitik behind their relief.
Iranian security expert Behnam Ben Taleblu, from the Washington-based Foundation for Defence of Democracies, said the outcome of Dr Moore-Gilbert’s case would embolden Tehran to engage in further hostage-taking. And, while welcoming the “joyous” release of Dr Moore-Gilbert, Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council executive director Colin Rubenstein said the three freed Iranians “will again present a threat of terrorist violence to innocent people”. The episode demonstrated Iran’s “ruthless and indefensible behaviour”.
Relief over Dr Moore-Gilbert’s release should not give way to illusions about the odious nature of the Iranian theocracy. As a medium power, Australia has limited leverage outside our immediate region, especially in dealing with a sophisticated revisionist power such as Iran. Iran is the most serious threat to Middle East peace. It has resolutely rejected recent positive developments in the stance of Sunni Gulf states towards Israel. The mullahs continue to threaten the existence of the only democratic state in the region. They continue to arm and train Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists in their operations in the West Bank. Their ruthless Revolutionary Guards support surrogate forces in the civil war in Yemen and in the residue of the Syrian war. Their navy intermittently engages in unprovoked harassment of vessels attempting to cross the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman. Iran, alarmingly, has developed strategic cyber capabilities and remains committed to the acquisition of nuclear weapons. The malign nature of the theocracy in Tehran was evident in its customary belligerent language denouncing “Zionist” influences and continuing to insist that Dr Moore-Gilbert was an operative for two intelligence agencies.
For her part, Dr Moore-Gilbert was magnanimous in expressing her fondness for the people of Iran: “I have nothing but respect, love and admiration for the great nation of Iran and its warm-hearted, generous and brave people,” she said. “It is with bittersweet feelings that I depart your country, despite the injustices which I have been subjected to. I came to Iran as a friend and with friendly intentions, and depart Iran with those sentiments not only still intact but strengthened.” She has a deep interest in Iranian culture and society. And the Iranian people are not synonymous with the mullahs who have ruled since the revolution that ousted Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979. Indeed, there is a groundswell of discontent with the ruling oligarchy. No liberal democratic government willingly abandons citizens to arbitrary detention in a nation such as Iran. Australia, being inexperienced with prisoner swaps, must always be judicious in the methods we employ to secure the safety of those who take risks voluntarily. It is to be hoped this is the end of this saga and not a precursor to more treachery by Iran or to violence by those released in Thailand.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Ayatollahs’ challenge to Biden	The Australian	Iran’s war games are a sign its nuclear ambitions continue unabated US president-elect Joe Biden has never deviated from his view that the US’s return to Barack Obama’s 2015 nuclear deal with Iran should be a priority. But it will be problematic for world peace if Mr Biden’s nomination of the lead US negotiator responsible for the terms of the agreement, Wendy Sherman, 71, to a key US State Department post, indicates he is prepared to sign the US up again to the flawed framework of the original deal, without the root-and branch changes it needs. The issue will be an early test of Mr Biden’s strategic policy acumen and strength.
Ms Sherman has been named US deputy secretary of state. She will work closely with incoming secretary of state Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan. All were heavily involved in negotiating the original Obama deal, none more so than Ms Sherman, who was the broker of the accord with Tehran. She will fill a similar role in any new negotiations. Mr Biden must ensure she does not repeat mistakes made previously. These imperilled Israel’s security and led Donald Trump to pull the US out in 2018.
Events since 2015 have shown Ms Sherman and then-boss, ex-US secretary of state John Kerry, were taken to the cleaners in negotiations. They gave in on just about every Western demand, including Mr Obama’s pledge to end Iran’s nuclear threat. Sunset clauses in the deal mean that by 2030 all restrictions on the ayatollahs’ nuclear activities will expire. They will be entitled to break out and build nuclear weapons. Iran’s nefarious role as the world’s leading sponsor of state terrorism was ignored. So was its advanced missile-building technology, the progress of which was underlined in recent days. Iran has reportedly tested new long-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting targets 1800km away. At least two missiles, reportedly, exploded on impact when they landed in the vicinity of US nuclear aircraft carrier Nimitz in the Indian Ocean.
The launches coincided with Tehran’s announcement it had breached the terms of the Obama deal and was ramping up its nuclear activity by enriching uranium to 20 per cent, levels unseen since the accord. In a move aimed at pressuring the US into rushing back into a deal, Iran has also advised the UN nuclear watchdog it is advancing research into uranium metal production of the type that would be needed to build nuclear weapons. That is another brazen breach of limits agreed in 2015.
European co-signatories to the deal Germany, France and the UK are alarmed. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a 20 per cent enrichment level “is a very serious development and a matter of deep concern that has very severe proliferation implications”. Tehran’s undiminished nuclear ambitions will be a headache for the Biden administration. Mr Trump had good reason to pull out of a deal that was doing little to restrain Iran. But neither did his severe sanctions or threats do much to deter Iran. Israel, reportedly, is preparing new strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
There can be no return to the pre-Trump status quo and the terms of the 2015 deal. The world has moved on. Moderate Arab states are as concerned as Israel at the threat posed by Iran. Any new deal must scrap the ill-conceived sunset clauses and end Iran’s brazen, ongoing support for terrorism and aggression across the Middle East, as well as guarantee Israel’s inviolable security. Incoming national security adviser Mr Sullivan says the Biden administration wants to put Iran “back in the box”. That will only be achieved if any new deal compels the ayatollahs to keep their commitments.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Playing into jihadists’ hands	The Australian	Iraq needs coalition troops for its own territorial integrity
Iraq’s parliament has put in peril the country’s true interests with its demand for the expulsion of all US and coalition troops, including 300 Australians, in response to the assassination of Iranian warlord Qassem Soleimani. By doing so when thousands of Islamic State terrorists are known to be regrouping, Iraqi MPs have failed to learn the grim lesson of Barack Obama’s 2011 decision to prematurely withdraw all US troops, which opened the door to the establishment of the Islamic State caliphate and years of bloody conflict in both Iraq and Syria.
Three years later, faced with the catastrophic prospect of a jihadist takeover in Baghdad, Mr Obama had to rush troops back. The 5000 there now operate alongside coalition forces. They are protection against the widely apprehended revival of Islamic State and play a vital role in supporting Iraqi forces hunting down the terrorists. Without US surveillance, intelligence and air and ground support, Islamic State would be able to operate with impunity. The US troops are essential, too, for Iraq’s ability to counter the actions of Iran’s lethal Shia militia proxies, which have been increasingly deployed by Tehran as part of its drive to assert Iranian Shia hegemony over Iraq and turn it into a satellite state.
Iraqi parliamentarians faced death threats from Kataeb Hezbollah, the militia allied to Soleimani’s notorious Quds Force that stormed the US embassy in Baghdad last week. The MPs were warned to support the anti-US expulsion motion. Overwhelmingly, Shia members did so, but Sunni and Kurdish members who make up half the parliament stayed away. Soleimani’s role in seeking to expand Tehran’s influence and military power across the Middle East meant he was a deadly enemy of an independent Iraq. Yet with anti-American sentiment running high in Iraq following the assassination, serious doubts have emerged about the ongoing viability of US and coalition help against Islamic State. Sam Heller, of the International Crisis Group, has warned that the turn of events may give Islamic State “room to operate and allow it to break out of its marginality”.
According to the Pentagon, US President Donald Trump’s despatch of another 3000 US troops to the Middle East in the aftermath of Soleimani’s death brings the total US troop deployment across the region to 80,000. Iraqi MPs, in their zeal to do Tehran’s bidding, would do well to think again and recognise this deployment as a demonstration of US power and commitment in the region.As for America’s allies, they should support Mr Trump in showing that the days when Iran could act with impunity are over. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has rightly complained of the muted response of Western allies to the end of Soleimani’s career of bloodshed and destabilisation. It is also time for European realism on Iran’s nuclear program. As signatories to Mr Obama’s flawed nuclear deal, Britain, France and Germany should recognise Tehran’s announcement that it is suspending commitments on the production of enriched uranium as confirmation that the agreement is definitively dead. According to analysts, Iran’s decision means it could be just months away from being able to accumulate enough nuclear fuel for one atomic bomb. What’s required now is unity and resolution in the face of Iran’s aggressive posture.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Moment of truth for peace plan	The Australian	Israeli and Palestinian leaders need to move forward
Palestinian leaders are ill-serving their people in stubbornly rejecting “everything to do with” Donald Trump’s long-awaited “Deal of the Century” Middle East peace plan, even before its full details emerge. These could be revealed in Washington this week when Mr Trump meets Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli opposition leader General Benny Gantz. Given the importance of a plan that has been worked on for three years, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas should be there. Still peeved over Mr Trump’s 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, which Mr Abbas wrongly claimed would cause mass unrest in the Arab world, he pre-emptively rejects “everything” Mr Trump does.
Given the social, economic and security woes confronting the Palestinians, his attitude is counter-productive. That said, what is known of the Trump plan is unlikely to bring much joy to Ramallah. It is expected to allow Israel to annex much of the West Bank, including the Jewish settlements, and all of Jerusalem, with the Palestinians granted a form of self-rule under tight restrictions. With the backing of wealthy Gulf states, it is also likely to be closely aligned with last year’s announcement of a $US50bn investment plan to lift the Palestinian territories and neighbouring Arab economies out of poverty. The plan needs to reinvigorate the search for Middle East peace, dormant since negotiations collapsed in 2014.
As Israeli leaders head towards an unprecedented third election in a year on March 2, with polls suggesting it could be inconclusive, they also need to embrace whatever momentum the plan generates. Mr Netanyahu, a wily politician, sees it as a potential boost for his re-election hopes. Mr Gantz testily insisted he would discuss the plan with Mr Trump alone, not with Mr Netanyahu, highlighting the mistrust at the heart of Israeli politics. Mr Gantz intends to rush home after seeing Mr Trump to attend a parliamentary meeting to thwart Mr Netanyahu’s request for immunity from prosecution on corruption charges.The Palestinians deserve better than the dead-end leadership that has sidelined them from meaningful input into Mr Trump’s deal. Israelis, too, deserve better than the partisan pettiness that has prevented the Jewish state getting a government with a new mandate. Mr Gantz has rejected repeated offers from Mr Netanyahu to form a government of national unity, leaving the interim government badly constrained. It has been unable to proceed with new infrastructure and crucial defence procurement, including Iron Dome interceptors. Israel’s interminable political crisis has delayed Mr Trump’s plan for a year. Israeli and Palestinian leaders should seize it. But if the Palestinians are playing for time, hoping for a Trump defeat and his replacement by a more malleable Democrat, they may be disappointed.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime

Covid, a time for unis to plan	The Australian	It is important to protect the nation’s research expertise
The Morrison government’s stopgap plan to bring forward $700m of university research funding from 2024-25 to next year will help save research jobs and maintain existing programs. It also should help slow any brain drain from Australia to overseas institutions. Many research centres in the US, for example, are less vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic because they are supported by generous private endowments and philanthropy. In budget terms, the proposal will have no net impact on the federal budget’s forward estimates. But it is predicated on a gamble, albeit one worth taking. That is, that international students will have returned by 2024-25 and that universities will be able to make up for the funding brought forward to 2021-22. In the event they could not, they would face financial calamity. That would materialise, however, only if COVID-19 remained virulent, there was no vaccine or other problems prevented students from China, India and other nations enrolling in Australia.
Universities Australia estimates the sector could lose as much as $16bn in the next four years because of the loss of overseas students. The number of international students beginning courses in the mid-year intake in July was down 45 per cent on last year, Tim Dodd reports on Wednesday. More than 11,000 jobs have been lost in universities this year. And the Group of Eight universities, seven of which are ranked among the world’s top 100 research universities, have warned 4000 of their researchers will finish their contracts in summer. The Go8 calculates that its members’ research adds $24.5bn to the economy a year.
If the discussions between federal Education Minister Dan Tehan and the universities succeed it will be a good investment from the forward estimates. As in sport, Australia traditionally excels in medical and scientific research. Some in the field who have changed the world in recent years include cervical cancer vaccine creator Ian Frazer, Nobel prize winners Brian Schmidt, Elizabeth Blackburn, Pete Doherty, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, and the cancer geneticists collaborating to unlock the mysteries of genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. Last year, the University of Melbourne and the University of Queensland outperformed top-10-ranked universities internationally for researchers whose work was referenced the most by other researchers. Some of the best are featured in our Research 2020 magazine, published on Wednesday. Amid the fallout of the pandemic, a fiscally responsible plan to help retain Australia’s hard-won expertise matters. This is also a good time for universities to take stock of the quality of their teaching, including online teaching, and review entry standards. Chief Scientist Alan Finkel preferred wise advice on Wednesday when he called on universities to advise students to take core subjects such as maths, English and sciences in senior high school. Increasing numbers of students, he said, were entering university underprepared for their courses. It is a bad sign of academic standards, as Dodd and Angelica Snowden report, that only 19 of 1587 maths and science-related courses — engineering, science, computer science, primary and secondary teaching, economics and commerce, health and medical sciences, and architecture — require higher-level maths in Year 12. It also raises the question: What else are the students learning at school? Subjects a former education minister once dubbed “cappuccino courses”? Nor are entry requirements consistent. As Dr Finkel writes, universities need to provide clear advice to students about subjects that will set them up for success. The shift away from prerequisites, he said, had confused school students about subjects they should be taking. Schools also have a role to play. Better preparation might reduce the 20 per cent first-year dropout rate on campuses, which is costly and often disheartening for students and families.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
EDITORIAL Paying back student loans not negotiable	Hawkes Bay Today	It is only a couple of weeks into the year, and already the first student debt-related border arrest has made headlines.
A woman, who had returned to the country to visit her sick mother, was arrested at Auckland Airport while about to fly to the United States, jailed for a night, and was before the court on Monday.
It will undoubtedly add more fuel to the fire for student unions, who argue a “draconian” law change targeting student debt defaulters living overseas has created “student-loan refugees”, who are unable to return home for significant events.
However, it is important to keep the arrests in perspective. Inland Revenue says seeking arrest warrants for student loan defaulters leaving the country is done only as a “last resort, after all other avenues have been exhausted”.
Indeed, there have been only nine arrests since the policy was enacted in 2014: three in 2016, one in 2017, two in 2018 and 2019, and the one so far this year. Draconian? Surely not, when the department clearly states it has relief options available for those in hardship and struggling to meet repayments.
Pushing youngsters offshore and trapping them there? Debatable. Many will be seeking an OE anyway, and jobs are often likely to be higher-paying offshore.
It is true some of the 100,000 borrowers choosing to live and work overseas say the interest repayments that apply to them are crippling, but surely it is right to offer the interest-free incentive on loans to the vast majority of borrowers who choose to remain in New Zealand and work here for the country that has funded their tertiary education and career opportunities?
There is no doubt the amount of student debt and its impact is concerning.
Our Generation Debt series last year contained some stark figures: $16 billion of total student loan debt; 1.3 million New Zealanders who have taken out student loans from 1992 to 2017; more than 700,000 borrowers with outstanding debt; more than 100,000 with overdue debt; some students with individual debt of more than $400,000; and the top 10 outstanding borrowers who collectively owe $4.28 million.
The repercussions of that debt are also significant, affecting choices from study and career, to home ownership and childbearing, to country of residence, and contributed to mental health issues. Hundreds have declared themselves bankrupt.
Yet official OECD figures show the scheme has been worth it, as the investment pays off.
It is also apparent some former students have been thankful for the scheme and the lives it has provided them.
Many are paying off their loans through good management, hard work, and sometimes better-paying jobs gained often as a result of their studies.
When so many are working hard to meet their repayments, it would be wrong to overlook those who are not doing the same.

Indigenous communities are key to closing the gap	The Australian	It is time to move beyond the ‘racism of low expectations’ The new Closing the Gap agreement, to be released within days, is set to break important new ground. Community-controlled Indigenous ­organisations will take much of the responsibility for delivering changes needed to reduce Indigenous disadvantage. That is welcome. The Australian has long recognised that improved outcomes in health, education, quality of life and employment need to be motivated by the main stakeholders in the process — families and communities. Adequate resourcing will be vital; and when the 16 revised Closing the Gap targets are released, the states and territories — as signatories to the agreement — will have a year to present implementation plans to the body to be known as the Joint Council, co-chaired by Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt and Pat Turner, who represents 50 Indigenous organisations. Given the depth of the problems that need to be addressed, the concerns of some Indigenous leaders are understandable. While Indigenous people taking control and responsibility should help, communities will need good leadership, training and support to tackle problems that governments, with all their resources, have not solved over 12 years.
The expected target to reduce the number of ­Aboriginal and Torres Strait ­Islander children in out-of-home care by 45 per cent by 2031, for example, is worrying some experienced workers in the fields of family violence and child abuse, as Paige Taylor reported on Tuesday. Jacynta Krakouer, a Mineng Noongar woman who teaches at the University of Melbourne’s department of ­social work, questioned whether the target was realistic. And Kyllie Cripps, a Palawa woman with 20 years’ experience in the field, worried that if the target were not reached, Indigenous organisations would wear the blame and the new approach could ultimately be dismissed as another failed social experiment.
Based on experience, it is clear that if substantial headway is to be made in meeting new targets, local communities and governments must adopt “best practice” approaches. On Cape York, for example, where four children aged 13 and younger — including one under 10 — allegedly gang-raped a five-year-old boy earlier this month, community leaders and medical professionals insist the Griffith (University) Youth Forensic Service program is the most effective of its kind in dealing with sexual activity and abuse among children. But it was dumped last year by the Palaszczuk government in favour of an alternative program. The new Closing the Gap system should allow communities to make those calls for themselves. As Alice Springs town councillor and Centre for Independent Studies director of Indigenous research Jacinta Nampijinpa says, a continuation of the “racism of low expectations”, especially with regard to child victims of sexual abuse, would be unacceptable.
It is also time, as Ms Nampijinpa says, for “Aboriginal women who have been beaten and silenced to have a voice”. To that end, it would be unfortunate if, as reported, a commitment to halve the proportion of Indigenous women and girls experiencing violence by 2031 is not included in the new targets. Instead, the states and territories are likely to commit to a “sustained and significant” reduction. With or without a numerical target, addressing the problem must be a priority. The ambitious target of a 15 per cent reduction in the number of Indigenous adults in prison by 2031 is a worthwhile goal. It will be assisted by Western Australia’s recent decision to desist from jailing fine defaulters. But regardless of race, crimes of violence and sexual attacks should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in the interests of community protection.
As the nation embarks on a new chapter in practical reconciliation, economic fundamentals — regular school attendance, jobs, encouraging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander entrepreneurship and regional economic development — must be a central focus, as Warren Mundine, the former head of the Abbott government’s Indigenous advisory council and a former Labor Party president, wrote recently. Poverty, Mr Mundine noted, was “the reason for the gap in so many areas of health and life expectancy”. His observation that no “race, community or group of people” had “pulled themselves out of poverty without an economy” was valid. After the new agreement and targets are released, possibly within days, the states and territories must build their implementation plans on principles such as accountability, transparency, adequate resourcing and best practice. Doing so, and setting down metrics to be achieved at local level, will provide the best foundation for success.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Tracing app needs strong limits	The Australian	It is up to the government to convince people they need it
So far, so very good, at least in quashing coronavirus. Repairing the economy also will be a stern test, with the timing of the challenges closely linked. On Tuesday, the news that elective surgeries, dental treatments, cancer screening and IVF procedures would restart after the Anzac Day weekend was the first sign of life as Australians knew it beginning to return to normal. We might be at the beginning of the end, or the end of the beginning. Scott Morrison says we are on the road to recovery. But much will depend on governments, health authorities and the public managing COVID-19. Any second-wave surge like that afflicting Singapore must be avoided.
Winding back restrictions, the Prime Minister said last week, depended on three prerequisites. Two of these are close to being achieved — extensive testing and the capability to respond to any surge in cases with sufficient hospital beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment for medical staff. Mr Morrison plans to fulfil his third condition — better contact tracing — through the government’s coronavirus tracing app. The app, which has won in-principle support from the national cabinet, is being designed to detect who a COVID-19 positive patient has come into contact with and who may need to be tested. The same approach worked well in Singapore and Taiwan.
Citizens in Australia, for good reason, are already wary about more incursions by government into their private lives. Creeping national security laws and limits on the public’s right to know what governments are doing are increasingly problematic. On Wednesday, Janet Albrechtsen details potential problems with the COVID-19 app. High among them is the record of government agencies seeking access to customer telco data far in excess of what was promised when laws were made to collect the data for set periods.
From the outset, Mr Morrison’s “very strong preference” has been that Australians would download the coronavirus tracing app voluntarily, as a form of “national service” in an extraordinary time. After Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly set alarm bells ringing when he said the government would “start with” voluntary downloads, Mr Morrison wisely intervened to make it clear it would not be compulsory. On Tuesday, he sought to reassure the public further. The app, he said, would collect data and put it into an encrypted national store that could be accessed only by state and territory health officials. No federal agency, such as Centrelink, or federal departments would be allowed to access the data.
While manual contact tracing can take up to three days, an app, as technology reporter Chris Griffith has written, would allow people at risk to be contacted within minutes of another person testing positive. This would reduce the exposure of loved ones, work colleagues and others to the virus.The government insists 40 per cent of Australians would need to sign up to the app for it to have enough data to function effectively. The onus is on the government to demonstrate how and why the app would pose no threat to civil liberties. It needs to prove all data would be deleted when the pandemic is over. Mr Morrison says the government has listened to privacy concerns and Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk is developing a privacy statement. In fighting COVID-19, technology offers assistance that was unimaginable when the Spanish flu killed 13,000 of five million Australians a century ago. But its application must not cost Australians’ precious liberties.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Welcoming back a familiar face	The Australian	It says something about the current political class that the prospect of former deputy prime minister John Anderson, 64, who left politics in 2007, being elected to the Senate is being warmly welcomed. Mr Anderson, who reached the pinnacle of what any Nationals MP can achieve, has nothing to prove. He says he is not seeking the rigours of leadership again. But he and his wife, Julia, “just feel that at this time you ask not what you’d like to do but what you can do’’. He has much to give — depth and breadth of knowledge, decency and experience, with policy and in regional Australia. Within the Howard government he was a ballast, which would not go astray in the Coalition and the Senate after the next election. Assuming he succeeds, his Senate contributions should make both sides of politics think.
Mr Anderson has used his 14 years of “retirement’’ well. His popular website, on which he interviews leading conservative thinkers from around the world, has attracted more than 15 million YouTube downloads and a vast following on Facebook and as podcasts. He has interviewed 70 people to date, including John Howard, Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, historian Geoffrey Blainey, climate economist Bjorn Lomborg and writer and editor Claire Lehmann.
Like many Australians, Mr Anderson wants to see a different tone in federal politics. He is also concerned about the divisive effects of identity politics, which, he says, “pits us against one another, and so denigrates our past that we feel unworthy and unable to defend the benefits and values that our forebears fought so hard to secure’’. His promises to be a voice of reason.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
We say Leadership lacking in Oz	The New Zealand Herald	It seems inconceivable anyone can still doubt or deny the existence of human-induced climate change and its effect on our precious planet right here, right now.
What to make, then, of a prime minister still apparently unconvinced by that reality when his country is being ravaged by out-of control fires, raining embers, choked by polluting smoke that turns noon to night; whose citizens are wearing masks, lining beaches turned black by ash and awaiting rescue in a terrifying rerun of the Dunkirk evacuation, and dying trying to defend their homes and livelihoods; whose bravest men and women are pictured night after day pitting themselves against vast, towering corridors of flame in scenes described by ordinary Australians and horrified onlookers the world over as “apocalyptic”.
Can anyone still doubt climate change happens in isolation — or happens elsewhere and to other people? Surely not New Zealanders, who have welcomed in the first days of the new year, cast in an eerie, orange haze courtesy of the massive current of smoke drifting across the Tasman from our nearest neighbour. As one person reflected on Twitter: “I live in New Zealand but I can smell Australia burning.”
Interviews with firefighters show this is war: on the front line — as they battle “mega” blazes whose scale, intensity and earlier onset they say is unprecedented — and in the corridors of power.
The test of a good leader is often how they react in a crisis. Our country was fortunate last year, in the face of two events that rocked the nation to its core — to have a Prime Minister who was present, strong but sympathetic, who offered comfort and leadership in some of our darkest hours, and responded swiftly and decisively.
The same cannot be said of Scott Morrison. The Australian PM has been widely condemned over past weeks: for heading to Hawaii on holiday as the fires raged; his New Year message that promoted Australia as “the most amazing country on Earth” where “there’s no better place to raise kids anywhere on the planet”; and other “tone deaf” pictures and comments appearing to trivialise the fires as the “backdrop” to the next trans-Tasman Test match.
And he is adamant there will be no climate change policy reset; no legislative changes. The fires are apparently nothing out of the ordinary, Australians are “resilient”, there’s nothing to see here.
It is hard not to feel helpless and hopeless in the face of wilful blindness of leaders who would label any inconvenient truth “fake news”, as our nearest neighbour burns, as Donald Trump pulls the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement and as the “Trump of the Tropics” continues his scorched Earth policy in the Amazon.
But we all have a part to play; in heeding the science, championing the truth, challenging misinformation, and demanding responsible, bold and urgent action of our leaders. The battle cannot be left to firefighters and teenage activists alone. Not when we’re all in this together.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
FROM THE EDITOR So far, so good in observance of water ban	Bay of Plenty Times	It seems obvious that we have a drought and need to conserve water, but it has now been officially declared.
Is it time for us to start reminding our neighbours if we see them carelessly using water?
Thames-Coromandel District Council has warned that fines of up to $20,000 could be imposed for anyone breaching the water restrictions.
There hasn’t been a single fine issued to date and TCDC largely relies on our community to be the eyes and ears and report breaches.
How do you feel about reporting water use by your neighbours?
In Matarangi, residents have been upset to see commercial water tankers taking from their supply and selling to consumers with water tanks.
The council’s communications team posted an excellent video interview and addressed this, in which Operations Group manager Bruce Hinson said this is now limited to six tankers a day or around 2 per cent of the daily supply and they’ve been diverted to Thames where there’s more availability.
He said not all Coromandel residents are on reticulated water, some have their own water tanks. Catering to their sanitation is still important, whether TCDC supplies them or private companies.
For many years we’ve debated what needs to be done to conserve water for the good of everyone, including the native wildlife that won’t survive if we dry up their habitat.
I think we can all do better if we try.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Great to see our centres back buzzing	Bay of Plenty Times	It was a noticeably busy weekend on the Coromandel and it’s so good to see all the main centres of Waihi, Whangamata, Whitianga and Paeroa buzzing again.
Bach owners returned in droves and it felt like the atmosphere of a long weekend. There were queues again in Tairua’s main street and the surf brought plenty out in the water of our beautiful coastline from Waihi Beach to Pauanui to Hot Water Beach.
Some people have told me they were getting quite used to the quiet roads and lament that silence. Police are reminding us all to slow down and remember that our roads aren’t a speedway.
As we come out of the surreal experience that this pandemic has been, the “life” is back on the street and coast and we can take comfort in the return of our holiday home owners who are such an important part of our economic recovery and social fabric.
There are still so many unknowns as those of us who could not work or go to school are able to return, and the words lockdown and Covid-19 will be reported for a long time yet.
The experience has been so different for everyone but we were all in this together. What will you take from this period of change?

EDITORIAL Everyone loses in homeless crisis	Bay of Plenty Times	It was a “gotcha” moment for Rotorua National MP Todd McClay.
After raising concerns about Rotorua becoming a dumping ground for out-of-town homeless for the better part of a year — and having those fears dismissed by the Ministry of Social Development — he could feel vindicated.
McClay has steadfastly dismissed the Ministry’s line that out-of-towners made up only a small percentage of the homeless living in motels. And last week, in a moment he surely relished, he was able to say: “We told you so.”
It came after a new sample survey showed 21 per cent of those living in Rotorua’s emergency housing were not from Rotorua. It differed from one carried out last year which showed less than 7 per cent were from out of town.
For McClay, the Government’s claims Rotorua was not being used as a dumping ground no longer stacks up. “Those people dumped in Rotorua motels are languishing without their support networks. They should be helped where they come from so Rotorua can focus on its homelessness problem and not the whole country’s.”
Rotorua-based list MP Tamati Coffey points out that both surveys show most people in Rotorua emergency housing are from Rotorua and accuses the National Party of “relentless privileged negativity against these families”.
Regardless of whose argument you side with, it’s clear housing the homeless in motels raises serious issues.
This has been confirmed by official documents obtained by RNZ which show ministers were warned about the “risks to public safety” in Rotorua a year ago, and that week-by-week motel accommodation is not so suitable for families, or those with high needs.
Perhaps the most serious of these issues is the welfare of children staying there for lengthy periods of time.
Whānau Ora North Island agency commissioning chairwoman and Rotorua councillor Merepeka Raukawa-Tait says what was designed to be short-term housing is stretching into months. She says children need safe places to play and spend time outside, in view and watched by adults at all times. Far better to move the families into permanent housing as soon as possible.
And that’s the crux of this issue.
We desperately need more social housing to accommodate families in need. The fact there is an obvious lack of housing now reflects a failure by successive governments to cater for this need — and children, along with their families, are paying the price.
And — because it has an abundance of motels that can be used for emergency accommodation — so, it seems, is Rotorua.

Victoria gets its mojo back at MCG	The Australian	It’s been a long – and traumatic – 537-day wait for footy fans to return to the Melbourne Cricket Ground. And they came in their droves on Thursday night to watch the traditional Richmond v Carlton season opener, with the coronavirus crowd cap of 50,000 almost reached. For the first time since the 2019 Grand Final, the faithful cheered, jeered and roared in the nation’s sporting cathedral.
The Tigers won the 2019 premiership in front of their army. And on Thursday night, they unfurled that flag and their 2020 flag – won in Brisbane – to high emotion.
Footy is the lifeblood of Melbourne and Victoria, so the MCG was hosting much more than a game on Thursday night. It was, in fact, a coming-out party for the city that endured one of the harshest pandemic lockdowns in the world. For 111 days, more than five million Melburnians were pretty much ordered to stay home as the second coronavirus wave claimed more than 800 lives and decimated the economy. Last year’s Tigers v Blues Round 1 clash was played before an empty stadium. The season was then suspended, and ultimately completed interstate. The MCG, the home of football, was deserted through the never-ending winter that came next. In many ways, its emptiness came to symbolise Melbourne’s suffering. Thursday night was an important signpost on the road back for Australia’s second-biggest city. An emphatic reminder that this community is not just resilient, but optimistic about its future, even in the face of the ongoing threat of a pandemic.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses

FROM THE EDITOR Helping with local dollars	Bay of Plenty Times	It’s challenging to put thoughts together about what we’ve all collectively experienced over the last four weeks in lockdown.
A little over a month ago, the words ‘bubbles’, ‘lockdown’ and ‘level four’ were barely in our vocabulary, and perhaps some of us took our freedoms or the comfort of a healthy economy for granted.
I just got off the phone to Hauraki District Mayor Toby Adams, and we talked about the impact that this event has had — and will continue to have — on all of us economically, socially, collectively.
Many industries are impacted and some will recover more quickly than others.
We can talk positively, but the reality is that there will be some of us doing it hard for a while to come.
Our tourism operators are among those that have had the rug pulled out from under them, in Toby’s words, and yet I talked with one who was still able to see the positives of how it was to see just locals at the natural attraction — Hot Water Beach — that he has based his business around.
Toby remarked on what an amazing attitude this was. And we agreed that it’s perhaps time for all of us to try to be as generous in our thinking.
Some of us have had the luxury of being able to spend money overseas on guides, restaurants and accommodation.
Maybe the next time we ride the Hauraki Rail Trail or explore our beautiful backyard, we can buy a takeout coffee to have with our packed lunch, or if at all possible to stretch the budget, consider who else we can help with our dollars. Remarked Toby, if everyone spends a little, it goes a long way.
This is the idea behind the front page of this week’s Waihi Leader and Coastal News — your local community newspaper — which we hope can assist in serving as a vehicle for businesses and readers.
Reach out to us — our team wants to help and we are in this together.

We know it’s tough out there EDITORIAL	Bay of Plenty Times	It’s easy to find someone doing things tougher than you in this Covid-19 climate, but surely there’s nothing more difficult than losing a loved one.
Auckland’s move into level 3 and the rest of the nation into level 2 is a decision that left us once again having to practise the skill of adaptability and resilience.
Community gatherings, funerals and events were again impacted by the announcement, including those of huge significance to our young people.
In Tairua, the loss of 20-year-old Bayden Williams whose death is being tried as a murder case, has been deeply shocking to the tight knit community.
The funeral had to be limited in numbers, but under level 2, at least it went ahead.
His young friends livestreamed the funeral service on Facebook so those who couldn’t be there were able to watch the emotional farewell of this loving young dad.
The space of the Tairua rugby field ensured social distancing could be practised and people still had the chance to gather.
Reflecting on our young people, the 11th hour cancellation of the East Waikato Expo, so-called Can Do, was a blow to organisers of course, but a reminder of what our youngsters are facing with so much disruption in their career choices, goal setting and future planning.
The same goes for their once-in-a-lifetime social highlight, the school ball season — although perhaps there’s hope that some of these might still go ahead in our area — and the old saying “one day at a time” seems helpful here.
I searched for advice for young people, and found a great resource online by Dr Lucy Hone and Dr Denise Quinlan, published on the New Zealand Institute of Wellbeing and Resilience website.
Working in emergency management and resilience training, they say during the worst of times it is more important than ever for our psychological health to tune into what’s still good in your world.
And another great message: Focus on what matters, and what you can control. Concentrate all your attention and resources — psychological, social, physical, emotional, knowledge — on the things that matter and that you can actually influence. Easy to write, hard to do we know, but worrying about things you cannot change will only upset you and frustrate you further.

No apology needed for port proposal	The New Zealand Herald	It’s hard to fault the timing of Chris Darby’s fresh proposal for Auckland Council to sell down its stake in Ports of Auckland, even if by his own admission his message delivery wasn’t the greatest. What it has done is reignited discussion about the Super City’s finances which, let’s be honest, are dire.
That Darby ended up apologising to his fellow councillors and Mayor Phil Goff for blindsiding them with his four-page report does not take away from the fact that Auckland needs to make some decisions around funding, and make them fast.
Ratepayers already suffering from Covid-19 fallout cannot bear the full brunt of the city’s funding shortfall, recently exacerbated by loss of dividend income from two of the council’s biggest investments — Ports of Auckland and Auckland International Airport. A recent report shows the Council will receive projected dividends of just $8.7 million in 2020 and $9.4 million in 2021 before increasing again to $64.3 million in 2022.
Indeed, the Council could and should be reviewing its ownership of these assets.
It wasn’t able to participate in the airport’s recent $1.2 billion capital raise and its investment was diluted to below 20 per cent, meaning it’s no longer in theory a strategic shareholder in that asset.
Darby’s suggestion of selling a 50 per cent stake in Ports of Auckland to the Government in reality is probably not going to go far — the Government has more pressing issues on its plate, including its own damaged books. But there’s no reason the Council shouldn’t consider selling down its stake by floating shares on the NZX in the same way the Government sold down its electricity company shares.
That mixed-ownership partial-privatisation programme may not have been popular at the time but it’s hard not to view it as successful. In most cases the government’s subsequent 51 per cent shareholdings — post listing — have ended up above the value of their 100 per cent SOE shareholdings while still extracting dividends.
The process of listing those electricity companies brought greater capital discipline and improved dividend yields, while also raising the Crown around $4.7 billion in cash to invest in other much-needed infrastructure projects.
Ports of Auckland was previously a listed company and, despite its poor performance relative to Port of Tauranga, would likely attract strong demand from investors.
Globally, ports are being disrupted by a container industry that faces difficulties caused by overcapacity and big losses for the major shipping lines. Auckland Council, meanwhile, has myriad of its own problems such as how to plug a multibillion-dollar infrastructure hole, maintaining investment in critical water and wastewater infrastructure and sorting out Watercare’s woes.
Stakeholders need only look at the Port of Tauranga as a guide as to what can be achieved with a mix of local authority and sharemarket ownership. Chris Darby needn’t apologise for raising such a legitimate question.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
FROM THE EDITOR	Bay of Plenty Times	It’s hard to imagine a brighter way to spend your week than at the Repco Beach Hop’s 21st birthday party.
What an event!
This week’s HC Post celebrates with some of the moments captured, but we have run out of space again for all the amazing photos we took throughout the five days.
I personally got a buzz out of the rock and roll march down Port Rd, Whangamata, when clubs from around New Zealand danced as rock and roll blared from a vehicle alongside them.
This was followed by the hand jive at the dancer’s hub, and a hula hoop contest.
Minutes later, the nitro methane exploded from Karl Boniface’s drag car, and Elvis crooned behind as classic cars revved past him.
It’s hard to believe that a crew of volunteers pulled this event off in just three months since the last one — although as we know, our volunteers are capable of miracles.
Enjoy a safe and happy Easter!	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Facts key to fighting threat March 24, 2020	The Northern Advocate	It’s like summer never happened.
At a time when we should be saying goodbye to the last of the good weather and hello to a feast of autumn activities, we are hunkered down in our homes, keeping our ventures outside to a minimum.
The term “shelter in place“ — once a phrase used almost exclusively in the context of US mass shootings — threatens to force its way into the lexicon with the arrival of Covid-19.
Now the novel coronavirus, that has been circling the world, has established a beachhead in New Zealand, and we Kiwis are at war with an invisible enemy.
One of the chief weapons in our arsenal will be information — and that’s where we can help.
Each day, through our website and the pages of the Northland Age and Northern Advocate, we will endeavour to bring the latest facts and figures, guidelines and recommendations from official sources. We’ll keep you in the know.
At the same time, we will share with you, our readers, the stories of Northlanders doing what all Kiwis do best: pulling together in tough times. In other words, it will be business as usual.
The team here at the Age will, however, be making a few changes to the way we work, for everyone’s protection. Chief among those, our offices in Kaitaia, are closed to the public for now, as are our Whangārei and Kerikeri sites.
You will find more information about these changes on pages10 and 11 of today’s Age.
Covid-19 is a frightening disease, and the wall-to-wall cable-news coverage does little to alleviate our anxieties.
But this is not a time for panic. It is a time for caring, compassion and watching out for one another.
If you must go to the shops, think about your local businesses. Know someone over 70, or someone in a vulnerable situation? Give them a call and see if there is anything they need. Just remember to leave it on the porch for them.
Kiwis have weathered tough times before, and we can do it again. This too shall pass.
In the meantime, keep your friends and family safe and spare a thought for your neighbours.

7 JULY 2020 EDITORIAL Running interference	The Northern Advocate	It’s not surprising that the views of an American anti-cannabis lobby group - and Christian to boot! - are not welcomed here by some as we prepare to decide whether cannabis should be legalised.
This is the natural order of things these days. Those who have firm views one way or the other can be relied upon to publicly abhor any outside interference, but surely there’s a gaping double standard here.
Justice Minister Andrew Little, who has less trouble than most in reaching a state of incandescence, was particularly aggrieved last week when an American outfit had the temerity to stick its beak in, suggesting that we should not vote for legalisation.
He went as far as to label SAM (Sense About Marijuana’s) contribution to the debate as interfering in another country’s electoral process, which it wasn’t, and made it very clear that they should bugger off.
How different his reaction would have been had an outfit called, say, Americans for Legalising Marijuana, had piped up, recommending that we vote in favour of legalisation. Would he then have been quite so precious about the sanctity of New Zealand politics? Not likely. Dollars to doughnuts he would have been pointing to ALM as the voice of reason, an organisation well worth listening to.
We’re going to hear a lot of rubbish between now and September 19, and amongst that rubbish will almost certainly be more facts and figures than you can poke a stick at regarding the experience of other countries that have legalised cannabis.
We will be told that crime rates have fallen, that gangs have gone out of business, that road crashes have reduced, that millions upon millions of whatever the local currency might be have been generated in taxes.
We will be told that those countries have legalised cannabis and the sky has not fallen. Nor will it fall here.
It is utterly inconceivable that we will navigate the pre-referendum weeks without being bombarded with foreign information designed to encourage us to follow suit. Will that be interfering in our electoral system? Some might think so, but you won’t hear Andrew Little saying it.
But that’s the way of the world these days, isn’t it? If someone agrees with our point of view they are invariably sound of mind with a valuable contribution to make, and should be heeded. If they disagree they are labelled as anything from misguided to malevolent, and whatever end of that spectrum they might be occupying, whoever disagrees with them will say they have no right to interfere.
It’s not unlike the phenomenon that is displayed on a daily basis, and not just here, where those who demand tolerance for their religion, their lifestyle, whatever, can be counted upon to display no tolerance whatsoever for those with opposing views.
This becomes more marked the further left one looks. Some might not have noticed, but conservatives generally tend to be more tolerant than the more liberal among them.
Perhaps that’s why the reaction to the Drug Foundation’s outrageous campaign designed to persuade us to vote in favour of legalising cannabis was relatively mute.
Read MorePatrick Walsh: A yes vote on cannabis referendum will be a disaster for young people - NZ HeraldDrug Foundation stands by ad campaign after being labelled ‘misleading’ - NZ HeraldCannabis referendum: All you need to know about what your vote means - NZ Herald
We can guess how Andrew Little feels about the foundation’s bid to shore up support for the referendum, because he doesn’t seem to have felt the need to comment. Why would he? It’s pushing the same views that he obviously believes in, and he is, after all, clearly less interested in those who have to make up their minds being spared any kind of brainwashing than he is in getting this particular baby over the line.
The Drug Foundation’s advertising has offended some, however, in large part over the perception that it deliberately confuses the issue of legalising cannabis for recreational use with access to medicinal cannabis. That was considered by the Advertising Standards Authority, which, the foundation was not slow to point out, found that the ads passed scrutiny, and could continue to be broadcast.
What it didn’t tell us was that the ASA had rejected the complaints via a split decision. We don’t know how wide the split was because the ASA won’t tell us. That’s not the way it operates, apparently. The US Supreme Court does, but not the New Zealand ASA. The vote to reject the complaints might have been 5-4, or it might have been 8-1. Whatever it was, those who were affronted by the advertisement can take some comfort that at least one, possibly four, of those whose job it is to ensure advertising meets a high ethical standard agreed with them.
Meanwhile, back on Planet Earth, some comic relief has been provided by the Ministry of Justice, whose role in the cannabis and euthanasia referenda, at this early stage at least, was the relatively uncomplicated (one would have thought) task of printing ‘voter communications,’ a fancy term for brochures.
This didn’t turn out to be as simple as the uninitiated might have expected. In some copies of the End of Life Choice brochure, which will be included in the enrolment packs that will be sent to voters, one of the answers to the question ‘Do you support the End of Life Choice Act 2019 coming into force?’ was printed bold. It was not like the others. That, the ministry decided, very wisely, could have been interpreted by some as giving a not especially nudge towards answering in a particular way.
So the brochures are to be reprinted, which it seems has had “an impact” on the Electoral Commission’s enrolment update campaign. It seems that the dodgy brochures were part of the ministry’s print run in Auckland, but had been sent to various sites, where they were packed together with other material, including the cannabis referendum brochure, ready to be mailed.
Given that it wasn’t feasible to identify with certainty where the affected brochures were, so they could be “extracted” and replaced, it was decided to destroy all 2.5 million collated enrolment update packs, and the other three million referendum brochures, to prevent any affected material potentially distracting voters in their decision-making.
“Having one of the answers to the referendum question highlighted bold could unduly influence a voter one way or the other,” Secretary for Justice Andrew Kibblewhite said. Indeed it could. And what a mess that would have been, especially if the majority vote had supported the bold option.
There would have had to be a second vote, and we would have had to go through all the argey bargey once again, probably for another three years.
How this happened we don’t know, but surely we would have been told if it was a plot on the part of some overseas faction hoping to sway the vote. Someone like Bolivia Reckons Euthanasia Works. That would be an unabashed attempt to interfere in our electoral system, and we can be sure that Andrew Little would have alerted us to that, if it was true.

Less to spend? Not a super idea	The Australian	It’s not the time to speed up the superannuation gravy train Put two economists in a room and you get three opinions. So goes the old joke, but a new survey of these not so much dismal as cautious scientists shows an unusual degree of agreement on the compulsory superannuation scheme that Paul Keating set up and still appears to run, at least in his own mind. Now at 9.5 per cent of ordinary earnings, this rather paternalistic culling of pay packets is due to rise to 10 per cent next July as it heads towards the legislated goal of 12 per cent by 2025. But two-thirds of the 44 economists surveyed about this by the Economic Society of Australia had only one opinion: not the right time for an increase. This is not an abstruse question like cryptocurrency. The reasons for pausing the long march of compelled retirement saving would be perfectly obvious to ordinary people, especially those whose livelihoods depend directly on business activity.
We are still in the early stages of profound economic dislocation driven by a public health crisis and radical restrictions on ordinary life leading to job losses, the collapse of businesses small and large, and a heavy blow to confidence and investment, with some people drawing down on savings and others desperately salting away any spare income because they simply do not know if their employment will be the next casualty. In these circumstances, the remote claims of retirement savings policy must give way to today’s imperative to give every possible support to economic activity. The enforced salary sacrifice next year may not be much for an individual but it represents an economy-wide loss of job-sustaining expenditure. It’s the kind of stimulus that might keep open the doors of business until an effective COVID-19 vaccine can be manufactured at scale and distributed rapidly so as to restore the good health and normal functioning of society and economy.
It’s true we shouldn’t blithely assume that by next year business prospects will have picked up enough for generous pay rises. Even so, whatever increases can be justified by productivity and a return to profits will still be better used recirculating in the economy than salted away in long-term retirement funds. Deferring the next hike in compulsory super should not be seen as a nod and a wink to unscrupulous employers who would try to pocket the employees’ share of successful trading. Companies would be foolish to attempt this because the social effect of pandemic pain is likely to be a refusal to tolerate greed. This is something for superannuation funds to keep in mind as they protest against any slowing of the inflow of conscripted income on the basis that their interests are identical to those of workers heading for retirement. The perils of the principal-agent problem are hardly new but the Hayne royal commission last year showed too many super funds far more successful in looking after themselves with fees than in serving customer returns. They are ill-placed to resist the argument that the maintenance of the system that keeps them fat on fees should be made contingent on serious reform. Meanwhile, if the super funds really do offer value for money — and demonstrably serve our future interests — it should be possible to persuade punters to kick in some disposable income whenever possible. Nothing stands in the way of such voluntary contributions, although it would require more effort from funds to craft and sell an attractive product.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Napier’s pipe dream of chlorine free water is over	Hawkes Bay Today	It’s over. Debate done, surely. Napier will never again have chlorine-free tap water.
A summary of Pattle Delamore Partners’ $400,000 report into how the city can get back to unchlorinated tap water contains arguably the most dejecting cost analysis the city’s 65,000 residents will ever read.
Pure unchlorinated water can be achieved, it tempts.
Just wait 22 years. And invest $295 million.
For all of those who’ve watched brown filth flow from their taps in the past four years after chlorine was introduced, this feels like a gut punch.
Chlorine was turned on overnight, without a moment’s hesitation, and rightly so, when E. coli was detected in several of the tap water pipes in 2017.
No one in the same position would have risked another Havelock North crisis to keep the water tasting pure.
But now we’ve learned that it’s not just hard, but impossible, to just turn off the chlorine overnight. There’s no going back.
Napier mayor Kirsten Wise says she’s determined to consult with the community before deciding if her council should try to go back to chlorine-free water.
But if there’s any sense left in the world then the report should have already made up her mind.
The $295m cost is not as outrageously prohibitive as it first looks. The council has to spend at least $178m over the next 20 years to keep its drinking water system up to standard anyway.
The problem is the time frame. Too much can happen in 22 years to justify committing to roll the dice on a $295m unchlorinated water package.
To choose to roll that dice anyway, even as the Government considers taking over responsibility for three waters infrastructure, is the very definition of a bad bet.
It’s time to find some positivity in the mess chlorine has created for Napier.
The complaints that flowed thick and fast after it was introduced in 2017 were things like skin irritation, taste and the bursting of already shaky household infrastructure like hot water cylinders.
These complaints have slowly but surely dropped away.
You could mount an argument that, as hard as it was to adjust, our bodies and taste buds have now become somewhat used to chlorinated water.
The dirty water that still flows from the taps, manganese shaken free from ageing pipes by a chemical reaction with chlorine, is something the city will never get used to. The complaints still trickle in to council, and our newspaper, week after week. It riles people in a way I’ve never encountered as a journalist.
But, and hear me out here, ageing pipes are a recipe for disaster with or without a manganese and chlorine milkshake flowing through them.
Wellington’s have shown this in spectacular fashion this year. That the manganese is finally prompting Napier to invest in its bores and pipes can only be a good thing for the city’s future.
I’ll drink to that.

Don’t let the virus weaken our political immunity	The Australian	It’s robust democracy that will optimise pandemic policy
Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s popular Prime Minister, has hit the pandemic pause button on the September 19 election, pushing it back a month. Opposition parties had pointed out that the country’s COVID outbreak — small by global standards — meant a campaign curtailed by tougher restrictions on the lively social business of pitching for votes. It’s a call for the Kiwis themselves, of course, but given the extent of Jacindamania on our side of the Tasman — much of it bewitching progressive folk who had anti-fascist fainting fits at Donald Trump’s recent musings on electoral timing — it’s worth a few words of caution for Australia’s political class.
The bigger and trickier the tasks facing government, the more the need for the normal democratic mechanisms of oversight and accountability. That means parliamentary sitting time, elections on schedule and media scrutiny informing public debate in between these regular verdicts of the citizenry. The Palaszczuk government in Queensland belatedly recognised this fundamental principle last weekend when it abandoned its brazen and clumsy attempt to criminalise media reporting of corruption allegations during an election.
Ms Ardern is clearly conscious that putting off an election is far from ideal — she pointed out that both Singapore and South Korea recently had managed to give voters their bookmarked opportunity to boot a government — and she pointedly has said there will not be a further delay beyond the new poll date of October 17.
New Zealand and Sweden probably best represent the opposite poles of anti-COVID policy, the point being there is still considerable uncertainty about the virus itself, how to combat it and how much collateral damage to the economy and society is warranted. This is not simply a question of gaps in the data or disagreement among experts but turns on inescapably political decisions about competing values and trade-offs, with the calculus likely to be different across time. All of this is — or ought to be — core business for democratic politics with its institutions and traditions fully functioning. It’s certainly not a time for superficial party-political pointscoring or exploitation of a pandemic to pursue pre-existing ideological agendas. But opposition parties exist to scrutinise the policy direction and decisions of government, and sometimes that requires robust exchanges because nobody in authority willingly admits error. So, too, with the role of the media. By all means, journalists should be conscious that those in government, not just the politicians, are fallible and sentient beings wrestling with a crisis; but, precisely because so much is at stake, rigorous reporting and analysis in the public interest remain basic duties of the fourth estate. Citizens are in an unusual position, having to sacrifice a degree of liberty and in some cases to bear harsh social and economic costs. But the quid pro quo for this is competent and transparent management by those in power, and that requires ongoing accountability.
Even in normal times, the tendency of the political class is to come up with appealing arguments for a tad less scrutiny. Now, in a state of near chronic emergency, the temptation to dismiss hard questions as a distraction from urgent tasks will often be strong and must be resisted. After all, it is the in-built and legitimate second-guessing of an open democracy that makes crippling overreach or tragic errors less likely. There are pragmatic reasons, too, for not running politics on a pilot light. The challenge for the nation is to contain the virus while avoiding policy self-harm that makes it harder than necessary to get back to life as normal. This test applies to us as individuals, workers, employers and institutions, government included. Under pressure, we can succumb — or adapt, devising clever ways to work around a threat we cannot eliminate overnight. Families and businesses are finding new ways to do what’s necessary. Politicians are keen to preach the gospel of technology and innovation, and there’s no reason they can’t apply it to how they co-ordinate federal-state pandemic policy, the logistics and safety of parliamentary sittings, as well as the character- building activity of submitting to the scrutiny and will of voters.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
The illiberal turn on campus	The Australian	It’s self-preservation for universities to encourage fearless debate
Quillette’s founding editor Claire Lehmann devoted her Tuesday Commentary column to the academic fetish for open-letter denunciations of colleagues whose opinions — real or imagined — they find disagreeable. She rightly identifies this practice — increasingly common across the Anglophone world — as one at odds with the concepts of academic freedom and intellectual inquiry that are supposed to be the foundation of a university.
Some of the problems facing society are open to technological fixes, but many challenges and sources of social conflict and economic misery cannot be remedied without honest debate drawing together intelligent people willing to weigh fact and evidence and find coherent principles to make sense of things. This is where universities, at their best, can make valuable contributions.
Unfortunately, various forms of identity politics activism have made universities increasingly unreliable guides to hot-button issues such as gender, the role of race in inequality, the balance between environment and development, the competing claims of free markets and the expanding state, and the legitimacy of the foundation of Western nation-states. The gulf between elite opinion and mainstream views appears wider than ever. This is a dysfunctional state of affairs.
In her column, Lehmann cites three recent open letters representing academic intolerance for competing views. All three concern live cultural debates, and two of them relate to the idea of an inner “gender identity” unmoored from biological sex, an idea enthusiastically embraced by the academy and virtually unknown to most people in the mainstream until recently. Academics who have asked legitimate questions about the possible conflicts and risks — especially for women and girls — created by this gender identity project have been targeted time and again, and not just in Australia.
It’s one thing for public intellectuals to band together and put their names to a statement that systematically critiques positions taken by other intellectuals. But the open letters now in vogue are not like that. They seek to silence an unwanted point of view, not to engage with it. They often misrepresent the views of opponents and attribute to them various bad-faith motives, as if able to read minds. They tend to make sweeping, melodramatic claims — that an errant view will cause harm and amounts to violence or some kind of phobia — without citing any evidence or even referencing what the targeted academic actually said. And with so little foundation, these letters seek to smear someone’s reputation, have their work removed from journals, get them expelled from professional associations, even make them lose their livelihood. This is strange and disturbing behaviour.
Lehmann’s hunch is that things are not as bad in the Australian academy as they are in the US and Britain. She is probably right. But, as she also points out, we don’t have any good data about what is happening. By its nature, the chilling of intellectual freedom is difficult to document and measure. The number of denunciations by letter and deplatformings that have made the headlines in Australia during the past two years probably would be surpassed within a month in the US. But we outsiders have no idea how many times a campus society in Australia quietly decides not to issue an invitation to a controversial speaker, knowing what the reaction will be. So, too, there is no paper trail of freethinking scholars who decide it’s pointless to apply for a professorship; of postgraduate students who avoid a hot-topic issue because their approach would clash with the orthodox social justice activism view in the department; or of brilliant and open-minded students who give up the idea of an academic career as stultifying and instead go into consulting. If universities cannot create a culture that attracts truth-seekers and rewards politically awkward curiosity, then it’s likely that sooner or later a frustrated rising generation and new technology-driven business models will converge in a serious challenge to moribund campus life.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Selfishness in collision with the public good	The Northern Advocate	It’s tempting to categorise the 70-minute abscondence by a man under mandatory quarantine as the act of a selfish, and conceited, villain.
Putting 5 million lives and an economy at risk, purely to stock up on superfluous personal hygiene products would readily qualify for such a sobriquet. Yesterday, he only heaped further odium on himself by telling the Herald he had “no evidence” he was infected with Covid-19 and he felt fine.
But, as is often the case with villains, it pays to look at the back story and consider what led to the terrible act. To do this, you need to look at the processes leading up to allowing this man to slip through a fence and disappear into the crowd. It was plainly a case of an opportunist sneaking through a gap in the managed isolation devised to protect the country.
The reason this was allowed to happen is because all the checks and balances have been set up on an ad-hoc basis as new problems arose. It’s remarkable we’ve made it this far with a clean slate of community transmission, but there have always been cracks in the system.
We do not know the full consequences of this mishap because the contact-tracing systems we have attempted to put in place are woefully inadequate. This is because they rely on us to make the right decisions. The Herald reported this week that less than 0.2per cent of the population had been using the Covid Tracer app. If everyone who entered that Countdown outlet at that time had scanned the poster with their phones, they could be tracked down, self-isolated and monitored.
An element of trust underpins the current system: the idea most people will do the right thing for the nation. That doesn’t account for the bit of selfishness we all have in us. Sometimes someone might just want to duck out to the supermarket or drive out of town to ride their bike.
It’s also worth remembering there was an element of wider selfishness that got us into this quarantine mess. The glut of quarantined arrivals can be partly attributed to Kiwis abroad who ignored warnings and only returned when circumstances became desperate or they had completed their offshore business.
The solution to improving a system so vulnerable to tiny transgressions will never be found in whipping out pitchforks and hurling rocks at a pantomime villain. Ultimately, there’s a little of that villain in everyone who slips past contact-tracing points without pointing the phone and pressing the “scan” button.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Who’s your Hawke’s Bay person of the year?	Hawkes Bay Today	It’s the time of year when Time magazine announces its Person of the Year reader poll.
Scooping the iconic honour for 2020 was, quite suitably, the Essential Worker — all those who risked more than most on the frontline during the Covid-19 lockdown.
A little closer to home, Hawke’s Bay Today too will take the time to mull over the year’s movers, shakers and headline makers.
Yes, this means we’re calling all nominations for the 2020 Hawke’s Bay Today Person of the Year.
Who springs to mind for you?
As readers would have seen in previous years, the bar’s been set high and includes all sorts — a boxing coach, a physician, holiday camp owners, businesspeople and community workers.
Now in its eighth iteration, we think the annual end-of-year quest is a great lead-in to the festive season and is also a glowing endorsement of someone we think deserves his or her name in lights.
Beginning in 2013, the inaugural title was clinched by Flaxmere Boxing Academy head coach Craig McDougall. Children’s Commissioner and paediatrician Dr Russell Wills was the 2014 winner.
In 2015, Emmerson Transport managing director and philanthropist Ian Emmerson claimed the honour.
Bill and Anne Perry were named the 2016 winners for not selling their Waipatiki Beach Holiday Park to private owners, and instead selling to Napier, Hastings and regional councils so it would forever remain in public hands.
In 2017, Maraenui community worker Minnie Ratima was announced the winner for selfless sacrifice and service to her community.
In 2018, musical pair Anna Pierard and Jose Aparicio took the trophy for their work with the region’s youth.
Last year, the late Patrick O’Brien was posthumously named the Hawke’s Bay Today Person of the Year after his sporting success, especially in combat sports, sparked him to set others on a path which could create a positive change in their lives.
So let’s begin the search for 2020 regional greatness — get your nominations in to editor@hbtoday.co.nz

Dan Andrews cops a serve lowering the net for tennis	The Australian	It’s tricky to turn pragmatic when you’ve been so uncompromising It’s tempting to dismiss the lockdown lament of visiting tennis pros as gamesmanship, just like challenging an adverse point to see if the umpire is a pushover. The Australian Open attracts hard-chargers, always looking for an edge. With more than 70 players off the practice courts and confined to hotel room quarantine after flying into Melbourne with COVID-infected passengers, Novak Djokovic served up a laundry list of demands, others ordered in food to rescue their imprisoned palates and some complained nobody had told them that hard lockdown was on the cards. To be fair, it’s just a handful of players kicking up a fuss; others have posted social media clips of amusing and creative practice work-arounds in their quarantine cells, and New Zealand competitor Artem Sitak has confirmed the claim by Victorian authorities that players were given fair warning about the uncertainties they faced by signing up for a pandemic grand slam tournament, assuming they were paying attention and not stringing a racquet at the time.
And Sitak no doubt spoke for many fellow competitors when he said: “I think we need to put some things into perspective, where a lot of Australians right now cannot get back home because of restrictions and we, as foreigners of over a thousand people in Australia, are going to be competing in a grand slam earning a lot of money.” Premier Dan Andrews had the right instinct when he resolved to try to keep the Open open, even if he exposed himself to the glib suggestion, which his callous partisans had directed at stricken small business during lockdown, that he was putting a higher value on the dollar than on human life. As we’ve repeatedly argued, maximising economic activity is an imperative for human wellbeing, not just for revenue, although it’s easily forgotten that without sustained productivity, all social goods — health, welfare and education, the lot — begin to disintegrate. This is not a charter for recklessness but for pragmatic judgment informed by expert advice and with a comprehensive understanding of myriad costs and benefits now and into the future.
Victoria’s economy is especially dependent on international students, and it’s perfectly understandable that Mr Andrews had hoped to get many more of them to return to campus faster. But in candid remarks on Monday, he acknowledged it simply may not be logistically possible, notwithstanding the tennis arrangements leaving more ample quarantine capacity as a legacy. And of course bringing in plane loads of tennis players and overseas students is a risk about which sensible people may make different calculations. In any event, Mr Andrews now appears more conscious of the claims of expatriate Australians — many in financial straits and under great stress — who are waiting for flights and quarantine hotel vacancies to come home, not to mention the plight of interstate Victorians who must secure a permit to return. Mr Andrews is in a predicament partly of his own making. Lacking effective and supple public health machinery, and perhaps the right temperament for such a complex challenge, he relied too heavily on extreme measures and self-righteous rhetoric. Hence the oversized anger from some Victorians when their strongman Premier appears suddenly accommodating to financial interests. In NSW, Premier Gladys Berejiklian eschewed the school principal moralism, gave no hint of assuming people were immune to economic damage in secure jobs, and pursued a balanced and flexible policy keeping business as open as possible. If Mr Andrews were more measured, his people would be more willing to cut him some slack.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
The law of merit and restraint	The Australian	It’s vital to keep political and judicial functions separate
We know that Jacqueline Gleeson, one of two new picks for our highest court, is the daughter of a former chief justice, and that the other appointee, Simon Steward, has a love affair with antique furniture. But we care little about their personal lives or private politics, satisfied that our opaque system of High Court appointments generally selects for judicial merit. The US process of Senate confirmation hearings has just confirmed Donald Trump’s third nominee to the Supreme Court. Amy Coney Barrett clearly had the legal credentials for appointment to the highest American court and her public grilling by senators included some enlightening exchanges, but also the absurdity of her being asked to recite a formulaic rejection of “white supremacy” and to affirm that she had never engaged in sexually inappropriate acts. The American process has often been grotesquely politicised and shamefully destructive. This is partly because the bill of rights is a charter for activist judges to decide value-laden policy issues that should be left to elected representatives.
Australia’s voters have wisely rejected the idea of a bill of rights, and our High Court judges must retire at 70 years of age, cutting short the term of any potential miscreant. For all the talk of having the usual legal suspects serving on an appointments commission and filtering the choices open to the federal Attorney-General, it’s not obvious that our system needs reform. The states get consulted and attorneys-general take wide soundings about potential appointees and may get more frank and pertinent assessments because the process is confidential. Of course, governments both Coalition and Labor apply a political lens but that has not generally prevented them coming up with appointees whose merit is recognised even by legal commentators with other priorities. For example, the current bench will be weak on criminal law with the loss of Virginia Bell. But both Gleeson and Steward are safe picks in the sense that they have judicial experience on the Federal Court and are widely regarded as competent. Gleeson has broader experience but Steward, a tax specialist, has had a rapid rise, suggesting he is very capable. He is seen as a “black letter” lawyer and the government no doubt hopes it has picked two judicial conservatives. Politicians have a poor record of predicting how judges will decide cases once they take up their independent office. One of Trump’s appointees, Neil Gorsuch, joined the liberal-led majority in an LGBT discrimination case in June. The ruling that troubled the Morrison government was February’s High Court decision appearing to create extra citizenship rights for Indigenous people not available to other Australians. All three of the Coalition’s most recent appointments went along with the court majority in this case. Even so, it’s legitimate for governments to try to appoint candidates who will exercise judicial restraint. Judges are on the bench to apply the law and sound legal principle. They have no legitimacy if they use their unelected office to enact their personal values. We need to re-energise true politics: serious debate and good-faith compromise involving the voters’ representatives. This means resisting the tendency to delegate conflicts about policy and values to lawfare in the courts, to dress them up as technocratic issues beyond debate, or stand by and watch them dumbed down by social media mobs. Put simply, society functions better when politicians and judges respect each other’s domains.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL What’s happening to board democracy	Bay of Plenty Times	I’ve been around long enough to remember a time when our elected members in community boards had the opportunity to be fully heard by those who voted for them.
As a cadet reporter still in my teenage years, a community board meeting was a great source of information and news.
Attendance was not necessarily encouraged, but these meetings — sometimes held during the evening — were busy, with community members listening to hearty debate.
Voters got to hear where their elected members stood on an issue of relevance to them and their town.
They also got to hear from local government staff and experts about the complexities our elected members face, in making sometimes tough decisions.
This is no longer the case.
Workshops are held prior to meetings, and this is where the “free and frank” discussion takes place. Because these workshops are not classified as meetings under the Local Government Act, there is no public attendance and journalists like me are not allowed in.
It’s true that no decisions are made at community board workshops.
But that is not the point.
I believe, after two decades of observing and reporting on local government decision-making, that outcomes might differ if free and frank discussion was open, too.
Projects might not end up so often shelved after expenditure or embroiled in costly legal fights.
I hold on to the idea that we should be living in a democracy where we have influence over how our communities are shaped.
If important discussions and open debate were not held “behind closed doors”, at least it might give the perception that this is the case.

EDITORIAL It’s time to teach toddlers to ease up on the noise	The Daily Post	I’ve been lovingly told I don’t need a phone and it’s probably just as good to stick my head out the window and talk — the person I need to chat to will no doubt hear me.
Yes. I’m a little loud. I like to blame it on being a singer and the ability to vocally project coming naturally.
Multiply that by a 9-year-old girl and twin 5-year-old girls who are blessed with the same genes and us Makihas are a damn noisy bunch.
When one of us needs to be heard, it’s just natural for us to get louder and louder.
No matter how adorable I think my family is, the truth is not everyone loves noise so I think it is common courtesy to shush them up if they’re being over the top.
Noisy kids have come into the spotlight after Rotorua mother Melany Eason said she was threatened with security on Friday after her 19-month-old was squealing in the playground that forms part of Columbus Coffee at Rotorua’s Mitre 10.
She was asked to control her son because there had been complaints about the noise.
Columbus Coffee said it handled the matter professionally while Eason was left gobsmacked because she felt it was just the nature of a child playing in a playground.
Having a child throwing a hissy, screaming or even squealing with happiness uncontrollably is difficult for any parent or caregiver to keep under wraps.
With my troop of noisy girls, we have frequently been to Columbus Coffee to enjoy the playground. While yes, it is a playground, it is also a place where people sit and enjoy a coffee, something to eat and a chat. They have a right to do that in relative peace, despite there being an indoor playground nearby. For parents and caregivers using the playground, it’s manners to ensure your children are not screaming their heads off and creating a scene that’s impacting the experience of others in the area.
You simply can’t throw your hands up in the air and say “hey, they are kids”.
While this is difficult to manage with toddlers, there’s no better time to start with lessons of what is acceptable behaviour in public and what isn’t. Eason tried with her son which is great, but unfortunately, her son wasn’t playing ball. As parents, we have all been there.
Children are children, they live, love and play and don’t have sound filters. They shouldn’t have to live in a bubble and be seen and not heard, but they should also be taught as best you can the world doesn’t revolve around them and their noise.

OPINIONAbout time Ardern mastered the art of the deal	The Northern Advocate	Jacinda Ardern's got to start thinking dirty this year, as in doing electorate deals that is.
Since MMP came into being there have been three-term governments, so a second-term administration would usually be a foregone conclusion.
But we're facing a volatile electorate – and Labour's going up against an opponent in National whose vote has consistently held up, with the majority of polls showing it outstripping Labour.
And for the first time under the electoral system the party with easily the strongest vote didn't get to occupy the Treasury benches, Winston Peters saw to that.
In his book, the current leadership is just as toxic.
Given what happened after the last election, Ardern can't afford to become comfortable with the precedent of three-term MMP governments. Precedent was blown out of the water by Peters going with Labour over National, given it scored 44per cent of the vote to Labour's 37, or almost 200,000 more votes than Labour.
The coming months will require some serious strategic thinking.
Simon Bridges knows that if he declares his hand, as John Key did in 2008, and rules out working with Peters it'll make it that much easier for Ardern to get dirty.
She'd do well to think of cutting a deal with New Zealand First, in the fairly marginal Northland electorate for example, where Peters lost the seat to National at the last election. The Labour candidate there, Willow-Jean Prime, polled third, several thousand votes behind Peters.
Ardern could have a John Key cuppa in the electorate with Peters, as he did with John Banks standing for Act in Epsom.
Paul Goldsmith has been happy to be the invisible candidate there, secure in the knowledge he's home on the list. It's hardly damaged his career prospects either, given he's now National's finance spokesman and he, like the party, knows it's the party vote that counts.
And doing electorate deals are in reality far from dirty, they're crediting the voter with some intelligence. It allows them to vote for the party they'd like to see in power at the expense of allowing a third party constituent MP to come through as a support partner and making the 5per cent threshold redundant.
Ardern must start thinking about her options – and making some tough decisions.

A Labor platform geared to a sedate party conference	The Australian	Jettisoning Bill Shorten’s tax hikes is a step towards the centre After ditching the proposed franking credits tax hike that was a dead loss for Bill Shorten at the last election, Anthony Albanese and his shadow cabinet are on the way to dumping the controversial changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax. The policies are missing from the Labor Party’s 2021 platform. And they deserve to be dumped officially as soon as possible. Labor’s conferences, attended by hundreds of party and union members, have often been heated affairs. But judging by this platform, the virtual, COVID-safe event over two days at the end of March promises to be more tranquil. That is certainly what the Opposition Leader will want. Time will tell if participants who want a more radical, progressive agenda avoid provoking the kind of heated arguments that would draw attention to the party’s deep policy divides.
The document kicks other thorny issues down the road for another day. As foreshadowed by The Australian, the platform confirms that the party will have medium-term emissions reduction targets. But it does not spell them out. It also backs gas as a key transition fuel in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and endorses “the crucial role that carbon capture and storage will play in abating carbon pollution’’. As one right-wing Labor MP told Richard Ferguson, the document is a win for Mr Albanese, “even if some of my colleagues won’t see it that way in a leadership prism. On taxes and energy, he’s bringing us closer to the centre in the draft platform, like he said he would”.
Business groups have tentatively welcomed Mr Albanese’s draft vision, with the Property Council of Australia and Master Builders Australia warning that any return to the Shorten-era tax plans would hamper the nation’s post-pandemic economic recovery.
The Labor platform sets out a broad vision and is not a policy manifesto; the detail will come later. When it does, the party will need to explain how its promised “progressive’’ tax system would pay for the lofty ambitions envisaged in health, early childhood and school education, universities, disability services, “rebuilding’’ the public sector after years of “cuts and outsourcing’’, and providing an aged pension that keeps up with community living standards. It also envisages “affordable quality childcare and before- and after-school care’’ with possible “changes to tax, superannuation, work and industry arrangements to support this’’. While understandably light on detail, the platform suggests Labor’s “big government’’ philosophy is alive and well. From supporting Buy Australia campaigns to acting as a “collaborative partner for industries”, the platform outlines a more hands-on role for government in the productive economy and in determining working conditions.
Business will also want to know more about the implications of such goals as unpaid parental leave of up to two years; the right to request a change of hours or other flexible work arrangements for parenting and caring; expanding access to paid parental leave; and 26 weeks of paid parental leave at full pay and with superannuation funded through a combination of government and employer contributions. After Mr Shorten misread the public mood among aspirational voters in 2019 on franking credits and property taxes, it is clear Mr Albanese is determined to avoid the same error. What is less clear, however, is how far Labor is prepared to curb spending in the post-COVID environment. The platform helps set its compass in the lead-up to the next election. As one MP noted on Sunday, it could undergo many changes, even with the conference’s virtual nature limiting debate: “There’s nothing more draft than a draft ALP party platform.’’	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
‘Tinnie terrorist’ freed too soon	The Australian	Jihadis may be clueless but their intent is still murderous
Melbourne man Murat Kaya, one of a group of so-called “tinnie terrorists”, was due to be released on Thursday having served less than four years in prison. This was despite Federal Court judge Paul Anastassiou on Wednesday expressing concern that Kaya presents an ongoing risk of “committing, supporting or facilitating” a terrorist act here or overseas. Because of this, the judge imposed on Kaya an interim control order with 20 conditions, some obviously sensible (a curfew and keeping him away from airports) and others not so reassuring (allowing him the right to carry a knife in a public space — if he has a reasonable excuse). But Kaya is more or less at large, and many Australians will regard his maximum sentence of three years and eight months as inadequate.
As the moniker suggests, the “tinnie terrorists” — or more accurately their plans — were subject to some ridicule. In 2016 five of these Melbourne Islamists were arrested in a remote North Queensland hamlet with a seven-metre boat that in their inexperience they thought adequate for an epic trip to the southern Philippines. Police had followed their every move, even recording them on the road as they sang Men at Work’s Down Under and cluelessly tried to come up with a secret code. The trial judge described their plan as one of “breathtaking stupidity”.
Perhaps Kaya, the sixth man, was the least stupid. He took part in the planning, such as it was, but pulled out of the escapade, only to be arrested at home in Melbourne.
But stupidity does not detract from the seriousness of the crime. The killing and torture inflicted by members of Islamic State did not require any sophistication or intelligence, quite the opposite. This was the end result of a jihadist ideology that, in its pursuit of a totalitarian caliphate ruled by sharia law, reduced the enemy to subhuman status and fair game for pitiless horrors.
It is precisely the same ideology that motivated the tinnie terrorists. They showed no scruples about putting it into violent action, it’s simply that circumstances, and their bumbling inadequacies, frustrated their aims. In the case of Kaya, it seems he developed doubts about the feasibility of the plan, not its moral justification. Was he simply waiting for a more promising opportunity to wage what he saw as the duty of jihad? The trial judge had regarded Kaya as a good prospect for rehabilitation. But he “continued whilst in custody to espouse extremist ideology, including ­violence (and) contempt towards non-Muslims and Australian law”, Justice Anastassiou pointed out on Wednesday. And he said Kaya’s dismissal of prison as “nothing but a test from Allah” showed a refusal to accept responsibility for what he had done and self-regard as a victim of oppressive non-believers.Like his fellow culprits, Kaya abused the freedom and stability of Australia with the intention to worsen the conflict and violence suffered by a regional neighbour, The Philippines, where authorities in the south have struggled for decades to protect ordinary people from the depredations of jihadist insurgents such as the Abu Sayyaf group. As such, the tinnie terrorists engaged in a double betrayal. They failed to show gratitude as citizens of a country that affords people from all over the world — and of all faiths — an enviable life of peace, harmony and security. And by plotting to spill the blood of innocent people in The Philippines, they failed in their duty as Australians to show respect and goodwill to our close neighbours.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Terror invades a peaceful city	The Australian	Jihadists are waging religious attacks during the pandemic The attacks in the heart of Vienna by assailants firing assault rifles from six locations left no doubt about Islamist terrorists’ determination to use the cover of Europe’s second COVID-19 wave to unleash religious warfare. Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer warned on Monday night his country’s freedom was under attack from Islamist terrorists, specifically Islamic State. Police said four people, including a terrorist, were killed. At least 15 people were wounded, some critically. Closed-circuit television footage reportedly showed attackers shouting “Allahu akbar” (God is most great) as they sprayed gunfire at crowds in busy streets near Vienna’s main synagogue. In a message of solidarity to Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, Scott Morrison expressed Australians’ shock and concern.
The onslaught followed last week’s beheading of the sacristan and the fatal stabbing of two worshippers at Nice’s Notre Dame Basilica. That atrocity, by a 21-year-old Tunisian man who arrived in September in Lampedusa, Italy’s main landing point for African migrants, has reopened debate about activists such as Pope Francis, who has visited Lampedusa, pushing for open borders. A Greek Orthodox priest was shot twice in the chest in Lyons last week. And last month history teacher Samuel Paty was decapitated in Paris after he showed students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed from satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Other incidents flared in Austria. A 19-year-old Afghan man was arrested for punching a 76-year-old nun in the face in a bus. And 30 to 40 young Turks attacked a Catholic Church in Vienna’s Favoriten district, shouting “Allahu akbar” and kicking over pews. Judaism, Christianity and liberal democracy are anathema to jihadists, whose hatreds predate the defeat of the Ottoman invaders of Europe at the Battle of Vienna. That famous conflict ended on September 11 and 12, 1683. Amid COVID lockdowns, anti-terror vigilance has become paramount.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Victoria’s shutdown sends big chill through economy	The Australian	Job losses, business failures and rising welfare bills are likely From midnight on Wednesday, one-quarter of the national economy will be in suspended animation. Victoria’s stage-four lockdown is placing a severe clamp on mobility to halt the spread of COVID-19 in Greater Melbourne and keeping a million workers at home until at least the end of September. Premier Daniel Andrews has drawn hard lines on which industries will remain open, operate with restrictions or cease operations for six weeks. Most retail, manufacturing and administration businesses will close, and strict limits will be placed on the number of workers in abattoirs, warehouses and building sites. Yet sectors in which there have been coronavirus clusters will continue to operate, including health, aged care and takeaway food. The bottom line is 250,000 workers will be stood down, companies will fail, business activity will slump further and Canberra’s welfare bill will continue to rise.
On Monday Scott Morrison announced a $1500 pandemic leave disaster payment for people required to isolate as a result of exposure to COVID-19. Tens of thousands of retail workers will be forced on to the $1100 a fortnight JobSeeker payment as their employers don’t qualify for the $1500 JobKeeper wage subsidy. Confidence is plummeting and supply chains across the nation will be disrupted as factories close and building sites revert to “pilot light” mode, as Mr Andrews described a one-quarter limit to the number of workers on some building projects. The Victorian Chamber of Commerce said lockdown 3.0 would be a “death knell” for many employers and employees due to loss of skills and local, interstate and international supply contracts. Mr Andrews said the economic dislocation would pervade Victoria for years.
The state’s extreme measures also will take a wider toll. After Tuesday’s Reserve Bank board meeting, governor Philip Lowe said Australia’s jobless rate would hit 10 per cent by the end of the year. He noted the recovery, now under way in most of the nation, would be bumpy and uneven given the outbreaks in Victoria. Official interest rates are on hold at 0.25 per cent, with Dr Lowe announcing the bank would be buying bonds in the secondary market to bring the yield on three-year government debt back to the target “of around 25 basis points”. Inflation has been snuffed out of the economy, with the consumer price index falling in the June quarter. But the RBA, which will issue fresh forecasts on Friday, believes the worst downturn since the 1930s will not be as severe as previously expected. The central bank’s “baseline scenario” is that gross domestic product will shrink by 6 per cent this year but will expand by 5 per cent next year.
In the bleak midwinter there are still some signs of economic life, aided by the lifting of restrictions in places where coronavirus cases are minimal or where community transfer is being held in check. New retail sales figures for June show shoppers and diners were back. Spending in cafes, restaurants and on takeaway food was up by almost 30 per cent, while sales of personal items such as clothing and footwear jumped by 21 per cent. Despite the pandemic and strained diplomatic relations, China’s demand for our goods has surged. The figures obtained by this newspaper for the first six months of the year bear out the Prime Minister’s claim that trade with China has never been stronger.
The news on business investment, especially outside the mining sector, is grim. Still, Infrastructure Australia says the pipeline of 155 priority road, rail and other proposals of national significance is valued at $64bn. These are extremely difficult times for the construction sector. New restrictions on workforce mobility and materials supply will delay projects and add to their cost. Victoria’s six-week lockdown will make preparations for the October federal budget even more difficult, especially as the bill for income support is showing no sign of tapering off. As well, the slump in company profits and more job losses will savage tax revenue. Canberra is at the mercy of Victoria’s success in limiting contagion in the community. Without winning on the health front, there is also no prospect of saving the private economy, the engine of revival. As we argued on Tuesday, keeping public trust and improving social compliance in Victoria requires competence in policy and openness with information. The refusal to answer questions in parliament by state Health Minister Jenny Mikakos will send a further chill through citizens steeling themselves for a six-week deep freeze.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Dole changes a pragmatic mix of carrot and stick	The Australian	JobSeeker is a safety net, but recipients must be encouraged into jobs Few people with a good grasp of economic policy begrudge unemployed Australians the $50-a-fortnight increase in the JobSeeker payment. It is the biggest increase in the dole since 1986 and well overdue. “It’s not a macroeconomic management issue, it is a fairness issue,” Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said recently. As long ago as 2012, the Business Council of Australia argued that the payment had dwindled to the point where “it now presents a barrier to employment and risks entrenching poverty”. The freeze had “gone on too long”, John Howard said in 2018. Predictably, some critics argued on Tuesday that the rise was inadequate, with the Australian Council of Social Service describing it as “heartless”. In the LNP partyroom, Queensland MPs Llew O’Brien and Matt Canavan raised concerns about the cost of the rise.
Across four years the cost to the budget, which is deeply in the red post-COVID, will be $9bn. The increase will return the payment to 41.2 per cent of the national minimum wage. The benefit was around half the minimum wage in 1990 but began falling across the next decade, through the latter years of the Howard government and under the Rudd and Gillard governments. The benefit was about 38 per cent of the minimum wage before the pandemic hit a year ago. While the $4-a-day increase is the largest rise in the base payment for 35 years, the payment remains at the lower end of OECD comparisons.
Conscious that unemployment benefits should be a stepping stone to finding work, the Morrison government has increased the mutual obligations attached to the payment. From April jobseekers will be required to search for at least 15 jobs a month, increasing to 20 jobs a month from July 1. Some jobseekers will be required to participate in work for the dole after six months or may undertake approved short courses. A reporting line will be set up for employers to dob in those who decline job offers. Increased auditing of job applications will aim to ensure jobseekers are making genuine applications. At present, as Stephen Lunn writes, under the temporary COVID supplement arrangements a person can earn $300 a fortnight before their JobSeeker benefit begins to taper. But under the new scenario this figure will be halved to $150 a fortnight. The government is casting this as an increase because it is more than the $106 a fortnight that was allowed before the pandemic.
As Scott Morrison says, welfare is a safety net, not a wage supplement: “We want to get the balance right between providing support for people and incentives to work.” Doing so is essential for taxpayers. Pre-COVID, the government spent $196bn a year on social security and welfare — just more than a third of federal spending. With post-COVID debt set to soar above $1 trillion and increasing demands on the budget to meet the needs of the aged-care sector and the ageing population, welfare reform must be a fiscal priority.
Earlier this month we reported that the government was considering streamlining the system with a single payment for the unemployed to replace up to a dozen other supplements or subsidies. Cabinet’s expenditure review committee looked at a significant reform package that would have accompanied an increase to the dole. That option would have addressed key recommendations of the McClure review. Patrick McClure, the chief executive of Mission Australia between 1997 and 2006, recommended in his 2016 report that the then 20 income support payments and 55 supplements be simplified to five payments and four supplements.
Previous reforms in 2018 went part of the way. But many recipients of JobSeeker remain eligible for a raft of obscure supplements including the pharmaceutical allowance, telephone allowance, literacy supplement and utilities allowance that range from as little as $4 a fortnight. Many JobSeeker recipients also receive an energy supplement. A simplification, while worthwhile, would be controversial. It would take time to get right and could be best undertaken in the first year of any new government. Folding such payments, which only some JobSeekers receive, into a permanent rise in the dole would not have been practical when the government had little more than a month to sort out the issue in time for the end of the $150 coronavirus supplement, which expires on March 31. Stronger mutual obligation requirements, in conjunction with the increase in the dole, are timely in the context of an increasingly buoyant job market as the nation recovers from the pandemic and the vaccination program boosts business, investment and consumer confidence. More than a half-million Australian workers came off wage subsidies last month, smashing Treasury forecasts for the jobs recovery, as Simon Benson and Geoff Chambers report on Wednesday. Josh Frydenberg will tell the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday that about 140,000 fewer businesses and nearly 600,000 fewer individuals relied on the JobKeeper payment last month compared with December. The change in the base rate to the dole is not reckless but neither is it heartless. It should help more people better prepare to join the workforce.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Biden’s Middle East balancing act	The Australian	Joe Biden had good reason to claim he was justified in declassifying the CIA report that puts the onus on Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the 2018 slaughter of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The political killing outraged global opinion and it is no surprise the President is using the report to “recalibrate” relations with the kingdom but in doing so, he must not overlook the importance of Saudi Arabia as a Western ally, especially in confronting Iran’s nuclear ambitions and terrorist activities across the Middle East.
Nothing excuses what was done to Mr Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia’s Istanbul consulate by a team of killers that included Prince Mohammed’s top adviser and seven of his personal protective detail. Donald Trump was happy to continue his administration’s close relationship with Prince Mohammed. Mr Biden has decided future relations will be conducted not with Prince Mohammed but with his 86-year-old father, King Salman. But that and other moves, including withdrawal of US support for Saudi Arabia’s war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, must not get in the way of Riyadh playing a key role in developing closer ties between the Arab world and Israel. That includes helping build the broadbased regional alliance needed to confront Iran’s expansionism.
Friday’s major US air strikes on key Iranian militia forces in eastern Syria were hopefully a sign that even as he seeks to resurrect Barack Obama’s deeply flawed 2015 nuclear deal, Mr Biden is determined to confront any threat to US lives and interests in the region. That is the way the strikes are being perceived in Israel. Other signs are less reassuring. In trying to get Tehran negotiating, Mr Biden has retreated from Mr Trump’s support for the reimposition of UN “snapback” sanctions on Iran. He is also consulting with South Korea, reportedly, about releasing $US1bn in frozen Iranian assets. It remains to be seen if the carrot-and-stick approach works. But he would do well to heed Elliot Abrams, Mr Trump’s special envoy on Iran, who in an interview with Greg Sheridan said it was a “fallacy” to presume that if Iran again began complying with the Obama deal that it would negotiate and accept additional limits on its nuclear ambitions. Mr Biden must also expand relationships Mr Trump developed with pro-Western allies, including Saudi Arabia. Undermining those as a sop to the far left of the Democrats would play into Iran’s hands and create problems for Israel.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Give multilateralism a chance	The Australian	Joe Biden has an opening to unite allies around realist policy Chinese President Xi Jinping’s failure to congratulate his “old friend” Joe Biden following last week’s election highlights the need for the US president-elect to maintain Donald Trump’s robust stance in dealing with Beijing. As vice-presidents, Mr Xi and Mr Biden developed a cordial personal relationship during bilateral official visits. This served both nations well.
Yet it is a reflection of how much things have changed that while Mr Xi can’t even bring himself to acknowledge publicly Mr Biden’s electoral success, Mr Biden has called him a thug. Writing in the journal Foreign Affairs in March, Mr Biden emphasised the “need to get tough with China”, warning: “If China has its way, it will keep robbing the United States and American companies of their technology and intellectual property.” Mr Trump’s China talk was sometimes erratic, but he brought new realism and toughness to Sino-American relations after years of Beijing exploiting the passivity of the West. In his Foreign Affairs piece, Mr Biden argues that the best way to approach the China “challenge” is to build a multilateral “united front of US allies and partners to confront China’s abusive behaviours and human rights violations”. It’s worth a try.
As Australia found over its perfectly reasonable attempts to establish the origins and cause of COVID-19, going it alone against China’s uncompromising stance is not easy. Beijing doesn’t take kindly to criticism, be it over the virus or the regime’s egregious abuse of the human rights of Uighurs and Hong Kong’s democrats. Scott Morrison, to his credit, made a strong stand over an independent inquiry into COVID-19’s origins while the rest of the world remained largely silent. A solid front of allies would have shown Beijing that we were far from alone in expecting the truth about the virus. The task for Mr Biden and other willing leaders is to craft an astute and effective multilateral policy to engage China and discourage its rogue conduct without becoming paralysed by disagreement on timing and strategy. One reason for optimism is that world leaders should have their populations on side. There is much less naivety now about the nature of the Chinese regime; Beijing’s bullying of Australia has been widely noted.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Urban chaos is a Trump card	The Australian	Joe Biden struggles to distance himself from street violence It is no surprise Donald Trump spent much of the Labour Day long weekend tweeting grim warnings about the “anarchy and terrorism” besetting cities across the US. The 100th consecutive day of unrelenting street violence in Portland, Oregon and elsewhere — led by far-left Antifa and Black Lives Matter militants — provided him with the best opportunity yet to use his strong law-and-order theme to turn the tide in his re-election campaign.
The result, as Cameron Stewart reported, is America is no longer focused almost exclusively on the politically damaging mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and its dire economic consequences, which have sustained Democrat challenger Joe Biden’s lead in the polls. There is little doubt that mainstream Americans, whatever their race, are appalled by anarchy masquerading as protest and by the failure of the authorities to protect citizens and property. Even so, it remains to be seen whether Mr Trump’s portrayal of mostly Democrat-run cities as awash with violence will be enough to overcome Mr Biden’s current seven-point lead.
Mr Biden is likely to pay a price if he fails to distance himself more credibly from this violence and intimidation. In his first campaign speech after emerging from his basement last week, he did condemn violence, accusing Mr Trump of using scare tactics to fan the flames of racial unrest. “Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It’s lawlessness, plain and simple,” Mr Biden said. But just as “progressive” media outlets have strained credulity with their constant refrain of “mostly peaceful protests”, the Democratic convention skittishly avoided any reference to the mainly BLM-linked violence. Mr Biden had no trouble condemning “far right” groups, “white supremacists” and “vigilantes”, yet could not bring himself to say anything about the culpability of Antifa and BLM groups in provoking and sustaining this climate of fear, which no democratic society can tolerate.
Mr Biden’s timidity no doubt results in part from his reliance on the far left in the Democratic Party led by senator Bernie Sanders, whose support secured him the presidential nomination. Its backing is crucial to Mr Biden’s prospects of winning. But so is the support of middle-of-the-road moderates deeply worried by the urban violence. As Democrat former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell warned: “What we were afraid of is moderates saying ‘I hate Donald Trump, but I need to be safe. I have to hold my nose and vote for him’.” All the remarkable political gut instincts Mr Trump showed in winning in 2016 are again in play. He moved swiftly last week to halt the use of a so-called critical race theory in US federal agencies, targeting the ideology that seeks to justify violence and extremism. This “anti-racist training” with its dogma of “white supremacy” is intellectually bankrupt and counter-productive because it only deepens racial polarisation. It’s an obstacle to hard-headed reforms in education and social policy that can propel black achievement. Mr Trump’s advisers have made two political calculations, both likely to be correct. The mainstream will reject critical race theory once its role in extremist rhetoric and violence is understood. And the Democratic Party of today will find it difficult to dissociate itself from ideology of this kind because it has become an article of faith for many of its most energetic activists.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
ALP should be a broad church	The Australian	Joel Fitzgibbon has unleashed a debate his party needs
Australia needs a viable two-party system. Our history demonstrates we are a pragmatic nation. Australians have never been seduced by radical schemes. We have eschewed extremists and preferred common sense to ideology. Our system of compulsory preferential voting reinforces this centrist tendency.
The Australian Labor Party is our oldest political party. It grew out of the strikes and depression of the 1890s. For much of its history it has represented working Australians. It provided a revered wartime leader in John Curtin and a great reforming prime minister in Bob Hawke. The current ALP, ironically, is a victim of the success of Hawke and his successor, Paul Keating.
In floating the dollar in 1983 and opening the economy to the chill winds of competition, they ventured where Coalition governments had feared to tread. Yet the forces they unleashed wrought deep structural change in our economy. While these policies were long overdue and in the national interest, they undermined the foundations of the broader industrial movement on which the ALP had relied for its financial strength and large affiliated membership. Today’s union movement is a shadow of the behemoth over which Hawke presided as ACTU president. Union members are a dwindling proportion of the workforce. And because the collapse of the Soviet empire discredited the socialist ideal, centre-left parties around the world have grappled to find a plausible critique of modern capitalism since.
Into the vacuum created by the demise of collectivism came pernicious identity politics. That has contributed to the alienation of working-class voters from social democrat parties throughout the Western world. In Britain, New Labour under Tony Blair proved electorally successful. But in its wake came socialist ideologue Jeremy Corbyn. Bill Clinton was elected to the US presidency as an unapologetic New Democrat. His party has since lurched left. The same forces were unleashed in Australia. And so far this century the Coalition has adapted better to societal and demographic change than Labor, which has won a majority in its own right at only one federal election since 1993.
The historic trade union link no longer serves the party as a conduit to the aspirations of most working Australians. One of its largest unions represents miners, whose jobs are directly threatened by the energy and climate policies designed by activists from the public sector and education unions. In the wake of their defeat, on May 18 last year, many in Labor recognised that they had become captive of forces deaf to the voices of Scott Morrison’s so-called quiet Australians. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk promptly heeded that lesson and reversed her stance on the Adani coalmine. So did Joel Fitzgibbon, whose Hunter Valley electorate embraces some of Australia’s most profitable coalmines.
While Labor had assumed it could rely on the votes of migrants, it learnt to its chagrin that many held strong religious convictions, especially regarding marriage. Many manual workers have become contractors or self-employed tradesmen. They abhor stifling regulation and would prefer to buy a home than invest in superannuation. It should be a salutary lesson to Labor that maverick Nationals MP George Christensen polls more votes among miners than most of Labor’s leadership group. Labor should embrace a robust debate about its future, such as that initiated by Mr Fitzgibbon. It rightly reveres its history and it has been a nation-building party at crucial times. But its branches and conferences have ossified for too long. There should be as much room for Mr Fitzgibbon on Labor’s frontbench as there is for Penny Wong or Tanya Plibersek. Straddling diverse constituencies is what makes any party a broad church capable of winning office. Labor does not need to split. It is not in anyone’s interest for one of the nation’s oldest institutions to fragment when we face enormous challenges. Anthony Albanese’s task is unenviable. But he understands that Labor must change. Unless it does, the quiet Australians may emulate John Howard’s battlers and consign Labor to the wilderness.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
No time for petty spats in NSW	The Australian	John Barilaro is threatening stability in our largest state Compared with other states, NSW has the most effective government in Australia. But it is crumbling internally, which could cause incalculable damage to our largest state and to the national economy in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Premier Gladys Berejiklian strengthened her standing on Friday when she called the bluff of Deputy Premier and Nationals leader John Barilaro. On Thursday, Mr Barilaro hurled all his toys out of the cot, threatening to take Nationals MPs to the crossbench over protection policies. But — surprise, surprise — he also wanted to retain the party’s seven ministries in cabinet. Ms Berejiklian, who would have been forced into a minority government, stared him down, booked NSW Government House and prepared for a reshuffle. And Mr Barilaro swallowed a big piece of humble pie and backed down.
Adroit at buffoonery, he told Yoni Bashan on Sunday that Ms Berejiklian and the Liberals could “put up or shut up’’, that he will remain in cabinet and that if they do not like it, “you know where the door is’’. Teamwork was never Mr Barilaro’s forte. He has exhausted the patience of some Liberal ministers, who have decided to play by the mulish standards of Mr Barilaro. They want to ignore Nationals MPs and leave them out of ministerial visits to Nationals electorates. That is a recipe for instability. Some Liberal ministers argue the crisis between the Coalition partners is “untenable” and want Mr Barilaro to consider his position. Last time he did so he was considering, amid much fanfare, stepping down to contest the federal Labor-held marginal seat of Eden-Monaro in a by-election. But he shied away, and returned to Macquarie Street with his tail between his legs after throwing the federal Coalition’s push to capture the seat into disarray.
Ms Berejiklian played with a straight bat on Sunday when she said it’s up to Nationals MPs to decide whether Mr Barilaro should retain his position. Questioned by Bashan, the majority of Nationals ministers and backbenchers locked in behind Mr Barilaro, leaving the acrimonious status quo in place. The bone of contention is more about brinkmanship than koalas. Outstanding differences on the State Environmental Planning Policies will be discussed in cabinet. The Nationals previously waved them through, though they claim this was done with a view to further negotiate the specifics at later dates. Ms Berejiklian is seen by some as being risk-averse. But after winning Friday’s stoush hands-down, she is right to try to turn the temperature down. She has struck the right note promising to work with whoever the Nationals elect as leader. She also wants to avoid “people, of any description, thinking they can publicly air issues at the risk of creating any sort of distraction for the community’’. The next election is not until 2023. The last thing NSW needs is for its government to become self-obsessed rather than focusing on the mammoth challenge of post-COVID economic recovery.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Labor’s ‘ugly’ win but PM’s bigger loss is Cormann	The Australian	John Barilaro’s stirrings might result in an own goal Anthony Albanese’s claim that Labor’s Kristy McBain achieved victory in Eden-Monaro “against the odds’’ stretches the art of spin beyond credulity. A century of political precedent suggested the opposition would hold the seat. It did so while suffering a 3 per cent fall in its primary vote to 36.18 per cent. While the Opposition Leader blamed the fall on the fact there were 14 candidates in the field, that did not account for Liberal candidate Fiona Kotvojs increasing her primary vote by about 1 per cent to 37.78 per cent. Labor scored “an ugly win’’ but a “win all the same’’, as pragmatic frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon said on Sunday. The primary vote figures underline the problem that caused Labor to lose the past three federal elections. On Saturday, it lost ground in towns such as Queanbeyan, a stronghold of tradies and other blue-collar workers. That trend suggests Mr Albanese faces an uphill battle within his own ranks to rebuild the party’s base among aspirational voters in its traditional heartlands. Interventions like that of former leader Bill Shorten last week, calling for a bigger public sector and reheating the rhetoric voters rejected in May last year, only harm the party’s cause among swinging voters and among Labor’s traditional base. Grievance politics do not resonate with them or their families, who prefer to get ahead under their own steam, not courtesy of other taxpayers and big government. Nor has adversity through the rigours of COVID-19 whetted their appetites, nor those of most Australians, to pay even higher taxes than they face already.
If Saturday’s result is a relief for Mr Albanese in that it takes pressure off his leadership for now, Scott Morrison has good reason to feel irritated. He took the Coalition close to overturning a century-old record. Like Ms McBain, Dr Kotvojs was a strong local candidate who campaigned well. But preferences were a significant problem for her. Or more particularly, the mischief over preferences whipped up by NSW Nationals party leader John Barilaro was a significant problem.
As The Australian revealed, he and his supporters deliberately undermined the Morrison government’s bid to reclaim the prized marginal seat by asking voters to preference Ms McBain over Dr Kotvojs. Mr Barilaro confirmed he had preferenced former Labor MP Mike Kelly ­before Dr Kotvojs in 2019 and had not ruled out a future tilt at the seat. The push among some Nationals to preference Labor over the Liberals, clearing the way for Mr Barilaro, under the Coalition agreement, to stand at the next federal poll, was a prime example of why voters dislike self-serving MPs.
The final count will reveal the full picture. But if, as appears likely, Dr Kotvojs loses by about 2000 votes, and about 30 per cent of National Party candidate Trevor Hicks’s preferences flow to Ms McBain, as Labor and minor party scrutineers claim, Mr Barilaro will face hard questions. These are already being asked by senior Coalition figures, as Yoni Bashan and Rosie Lewis write on Monday. “He’s not a real Nat, just a spoiled brat,” a federal Liberal source said on Sunday. Mr Barilaro’s conduct suggests he has forgotten a lesson writ large on both sides of politics — disunity and disloyalty are the harbingers of grief in politics.
From the perspective of the Prime Minister, however, the more significant loss of the weekend — to take effect at the end of the year — was Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, who announced his retirement from politics. Senator Cormann, 49, has served as Finance Minister since the election of the Abbott government in September 2013. In working with three treasurers, Joe Hockey, Mr Morrison and Josh Frydenberg, he is a pillar of the government and Australia’s longest-serving Finance Minister. His calm air of authority made him an effective force in restraining spending and negotiating with crossbenchers as Senate leader. Senator Cormann’s experience and steady hand will be needed more than ever in the next six months, which will be intensely challenging as the government pares back its economic lifelines and steers the rebuilding of the economy from COVID-19. That could be the most challenging phase, politically, of the pandemic.
It reflects Senator Cormann’s intellect and commitment that he has carved his political career, and mastered one of cabinet’s most complex portfolios, in his fourth language. He learned English in his early 20s, studying in Britain on a scholarship, after being educated in German, French and Flemish — “all of that in Belgium, a country less than half the size of Tasmania and with about half the population of Australia’’, he told the Senate in 2007. The principles he set out in that early speech, “free enterprise, individual freedom, personal responsibility, reward for effort, low taxation, less regulation and incentives for people to stretch themselves and to reach their full potential’’, have served the nation well. Commuting from Perth to Canberra for 13 years, and with a young family, he has left “nothing on the field’’, as he says. After a “cracker journey’’ and the next six months in which he has much to do, we wish him well in his next challenge.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
River system an enduring challenge of the federation	The Australian	John Howard’s Murray-Darling reform bid holds lessons for today
John Howard‘s great disappointment at not securing a full commonwealth takeover of management of the Murray-Darling Basin river system provides a useful reflection on the state of the federation. The COVID-19 pandemic has, in some respects, brought the states and commonwealth closer through a national cabinet. But recent events have also put a spotlight on how state leaders have been prepared to use their powers to act against the national interest. Some premiers have ignored the wishes of the commonwealth, and we would say business and community interests, in making decisions to close borders and restrict free movement. In many cases, politics and perceived electoral advantage have been the biggest factors in how and why decisions have been made.
In 2007, when Mr Howard launched a $10bn plan to wrest decision-making over water allocations along the length of the Murray-Darling Basin system, he made the obvious point that rivers do not respect state boundaries. As a dry continent, Mr Howard said, water has always been at the heart of the Australian dream. But, he said, management of the Murray-Darling had been compromised by “very, very bad administration over the years by governments of both persuasions”. Reflecting on the reform challenge in a speech to mark the 20th anniversary of the Howard government, Malcolm Turnbull said Mr Howard recognised that commonwealth management of the rivers was something that should have been agreed to in the 1890s. “John Howard saw that crisis of the drought 2006-07 and, never wasting a crisis, he saw the opportunity to make good an omission of more than a century ago,” Mr Turnbull said.
In Monday’s news pages, Mr Howard describes the collapse of his $10bn plan to nationalise the Murray-Darling Basin in the final year of his government as a “great policy tragedy” that resulted in a missed opportunity to redefine Australia. Mr Howard had clashed openly with then Victorian premier Steve Bracks over the proposal. At the height of tensions in July 2007, Mr Howard’s move for a commonwealth takeover of the Murray-Darling Basin was compared to Bob Hawke’s intervention to stop the Franklin Dam going ahead in Tasmania in 1983. Mr Howard threatened to use the full weight of the Constitution to bring his plan to fruition. “I’ve tried for five months in good faith and Mr Bracks was not willing to refer the powers because he doesn’t want to surrender Victoria’s power,’’ he said at the time. “ Well, I mean, we’re a nation. We’re not a collection of states. And the Australian people are tired, sick and tired of state parochialism on issues like this, and I’m tired of it too.’’ Mr Howard still maintains his grand plan to buy out state rights over the water source fell victim to “cheap politicking” — a “wonderful opportunity’’ squandered “out of political calculation”. Following the defeat of his government, a Murray-Darling Basin plan was introduced by the ALP with the states still in control. Many accept Mr Howard’s plan would have returned more water to the environment and included more resourcing to help basin communities make the adjustment than the plan that was ultimately accepted.
Mr Bracks declined to be interviewed. But other state leaders of that time have praised Mr Howard’s foresight. Former Queensland premier Peter Beattie says it is a national disgrace the whole package that Mr Howard put up was not accepted. He says the former prime minister had shown enormous courage fighting for a plan that required a great deal of change for rural communities that were the Coalition heartland. Former NSW premier Morris Iemma was an early convert to the plan and South Australia welcomed a scheme that could break the tyranny of the existing system in which each state has veto power over decision-making. The millennium drought provided the impetus for Mr Howard to take on the Murray-Darling Basin challenge. After enduring another cycle of drought, decisions about management of the river system are as important now as ever. So are questions about how to secure greater co-operation between the states and commonwealth on matters of national importance. Mr Howard spent political capital arguing for national outcomes over state and party interests on the Murray-Darling Basin. The same passion is sorely missing in many of today’s important debates.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Time to nourish the news guzzled by the digital feed	The Australian	Journalism and tech platforms can both enrich democracy Two decades ago, that canny rock star David Bowie told a bemused BBC interviewer: “I don’t think we’ve even seen the tip of the iceberg. I think the potential of what the internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable.” He knew a thing or two about changes. It’s easy to forget the simple-minded utopianism with which the worldwide web began. The same goes for social media, which was going to connect us all for a great big hug. That’s not to say it has been all bad; far from it. But for all its bonuses, living online seems linked to some disturbing trends in teen mental health, social conflict, educational challenges and political derangement. Deeply implicated in all this is the contested role of the plutocratic tech platforms such as Google and Facebook.
It’s worth setting the scene like this to highlight how absurd it would be if politicians and regulators kept their hands off the policy levers and just let the digital revolution roll on, hoping for the best. Almost three years ago, when he was treasurer, Scott Morrison set the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission to work on the digital platforms inquiry. Now his Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, promises that a new mandatory code to govern relations between the tech platforms and the news media will be ready by next month. The reaction of the platforms — stonewalling the idea of a voluntary code, attacking the regulator and spamming the citizenry with misinformation — has been unworthy of their intelligence and expertise.
Simple facts testify to the case for a regulatory reset. On mobile devices, Google enjoys 98 per cent of online searches in Australia. About 8 per cent to 14 per cent of Google search results turn up news reports, the fruit of years of investment by media organisations. Facebook has 17 million users scrolling through for at least a half-hour a day. Of every $100 spent on online advertising across the nation, $47 is pocketed by Google and $24 by Facebook; the total spend is about $9bn a year. What kind of competition regulator would ignore such unprecedented market concentration and power?
But this is not just about dollars, it’s about minds and votes. The ACCC inquiry’s final report in June last year documents the catastrophic decline in advertising revenue for news media as the digital platforms hoovered up their business clients. That was revenue relied on to invest in the costly enterprise of journalism, turning out the news reports and commentary that the tech platforms wove, without financial compensation, into their products to keep the eyeballs coming. Diligent and accurate news bulletins and analysis are the lifeblood of an informed electorate and a functioning democracy able to debate and overcome its challenges, and to showcase its talents and opportunities to galvanise the creation of jobs, wealth and all manner of social and cultural achievements. A viable news media is a clever country in constant conversation with itself.
This is why the government and the regulator are driving policy reform to serve public goods in the national interest. The tech platforms are dead wrong to suggest this is an exercise to cater to traditional news media as a sectional interest. In Europe and the US as well, politicians and antitrust authorities also are keenly focused on how to ensure that this new information landscape is optimised for society and does not become a dystopia. The ACCC approach is being closely watched around the world, and rightly so. It involves some clever and innovative ideas about how to remedy the bargaining power imbalance between news media and the tech behemoths, and how to counter the lack of transparency of these vast digital enterprises and their murky algorithms.
On Monday’s Commentary page, former newspaper executive Greg Hywood made clear the links between the digital platforms enriching themselves at the expense of news media, the collapse of mastheads, the loss of reporters’ jobs and regional coverage, and a dangerous weakening in the ability of the fourth estate to hold institutions and those in power accountable by means of effective journalistic scrutiny.
As the tech giants connect up individuals, they degrade the information needed by societies. The ACCC put it this way: “Consumers accessing news through digital platforms potentially risk exposure to unreliable news through ‘filter bubbles’ and the spread of disinformation, malinformation and misinformation (‘fake news’) online.” Social media certainly empowers the self-expression of citizens but all this online opinionising depends on the raw material of news reporting — and its quality. Precisely because current social media reinforces existing bias and taps into anger, fear and outrage, there has never been more need for coolly accurate news writing and explanation if we are to check political hysteria and encourage sound decisions. Perhaps when the posturing is over, the tech platforms will see that deeper collaboration with news media is in everyone’s interest. Social media madness is building a constituency that hungers for something more thoughtful and nuanced. There is no reason new online platforms cannot be designed, and buttressed with journalism, to reinvent a public sphere in which people can have good-faith debate and nudge towards compromise positions on the basis of shared facts and non-fake news. That shouldn’t be beyond our digital wits.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Mums are doing it well	Bay of Plenty Times	Just like the ubiquitous poster “Keep calm and carry on”, the phrase “Be kind” has become the motto for these unusual and unsettling times.
But what exactly does it mean to be kind? Kindness is a doing word, a verb.
Sadly, I’ve heard tales and stories with examples during the level 4 and 3 lockdown period that demonstrate not all people know how to practise what they preach.
Some have practised thoughtlessness or selfishness rather than kindness — perhaps because the stress of this time has overwhelmed them.
The majority of us though, can take comfort in knowing we were challenged, coped as best we could and will continue to.
Relaying opinions and pointing out problems is not the way that the people featured in this week’s front page story do things — they just do things.
It was a joy to meet them. Once I found one genuinely kind person, she immediately told me about others. Perhaps fittingly, since last Sunday was Mother’s Day, the three women who I met in Waihi were all mums.
It’s a mum who’s making the decisions for our country right now, and I suspect there were a lot of mums holding families together during the lockdown.
We are a gloriously resilient bunch, us mums, and I hope all who demonstrate those ‘maternal qualities’ of being supportive, loving and patient enjoyed a nice day on Sunday.
Not forgetting the men in our communities who are doing exceptional things for others — write if you know of a top bloke: alison.smith@nzme.co.nz

A quality judgment by Trump	The Australian	Justice Coney Barrett is eminently qualified for her new role
Donald Trump has achieved one of the most significant victories of his presidency, with the 52-48 approval by the US Senate and immediate swearing in of Amy Coney Barrett as a Supreme Court justice. It should give the Trump campaign a boost. Grassroots support for his pledge to change the progressive-liberal character of the powerful court was a key reason for his 2016 win, especially among evangelical groups and pro-life campaigners.
Justice Coney Barrett, 48, is widely admired as a highly qualified, constitutional conservative, someone Democrats regard as a potential threat on legal challenges to Obamacare, abortion law, same-sex marriage and environment law. But her decision-making as a judge is likely to be guided by the fact she is an originalist and a textualist. She interprets the constitution as it was written and legislation as it is written. At her swearing in she pledged to “do my job without any fear or favour … independently of both the political branches, and of my own preferences”.
Unless a Biden administration overturned 150 years of tradition and increased the court for political purposes, the 6-3 majority could keep it on a conservative course for years, regardless of who’s in the White House. In two forthcoming appointments to Australia’s High Court, our nation would also be best served by judges who apply the law in a black-letter way, as legal conservatives, as distinct from political conservatives.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Joe’s identity politics partner	The Australian	Kamala Harris warrants close scrutiny as a proto-president Seldom before in the US has the selection of a vice-presidential running mate been more consequential than Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s historic choice of senator Kamala Harris. Mr Biden is 77. If he wins against Donald Trump in November he will be 78 when he is inaugurated next January, the oldest person to be sworn in as president for the first time. Concerns surround Mr Biden’s acuity. Mr Trump, 74, trolls him as “Sleepy Joe”, suggesting his mental capacity disqualifies him from the presidency.
With the RealClearPolitics poll average continuing to give Mr Biden a lead of more than 7 per cent, there is no sign Mr Trump’s denigration is working. But the lead does underline the importance of Senator Harris. She would be no more than the proverbial heartbeat away from becoming leader of the free world if anything happened to Mr Biden.
Her nomination demands the closest possible scrutiny. The choice of Senator Harris, the first woman of colour nominated for the vice-presidency, is groundbreaking. The politically progressive but pragmatic 55-year-old daughter of an immigrant, Jamaican-born Stanford economist and an Indian-born breast cancer researcher mother, she identifies strongly as an African-American. She ticks most of Mr Biden’s boxes for a running mate at a time of Black Lives Matter activism.
Her net impact on the Democrats’ prospects remains to be seen. Mr Biden was already assured of much of the black vote. He was certain to win Senator Harris’s home state of California. But there seems little doubt the symbolism of nominating a woman of colour with a real prospect of becoming president could, as Cameron Stewart reported, “hurt Mr Trump”.
Better than other candidates Mr Biden was considering, Senator Harris has significant political, administrative and legislative experience. In the New York Post, respected analyst John Podhoretz, a strong Trump supporter, noted “there would be a strong case to make for (Harris’s) candidacy outside of her identity … she’s one of the most successful politicians of her age in the Democratic Party”.
Surprisingly, that appears to be a view Mr Trump shares. Two weeks ago he said Senator Harris would be his “No 1 pick” for vice-president. Although she presents as a progressive, as California’s attorney-general she gained a solid reputation for being a “top cop” tough on law and order. That may agitate some liberal Democrats on the “lunatic” Bernie Sanders fringe. But it will do Mr Biden no harm at a time when Mr Trump wants lawlessness and violence on America’s streets to be a major issue in the contest.
There remains a long way to go in what looks like being the most bizarre election race in US history, with the Democrats set for a “virtual” nominating convention that may enable party handlers to keep Mr Biden away from close-up media scrutiny of any potential slip-ups. The pandemic also denies Mr Trump the political charge he draws from live rallies. But Mr Biden must not be allowed to go on hiding in his Delaware basement. The Democrats should come out into the open. With so much at stake for the US and the rest of the world, Mr Biden and Senator Harris must spell out precisely why they would be a better choice than another four years of Trump and his deputy, Mike Pence.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Stay steady on Afghanistan exit	The Australian	Keeping troops in place makes Taliban peace more likely President Donald Trump’s wish to see all US troops in Afghanistan brought home before he leaves office on January 20 is understandable. His promise to halt American involvement in “endless wars” was a key factor in the 2016 victory that won him the White House. It remains unfinished business. But he needs to be cautious about rushing for the exits too soon in the still severely war-ravaged Islamist extremist stronghold that was the launch pad for the 9/11 attacks, without a peace deal with the Taliban, and with Islamic State and al-Qa’ida terrorists stepping up their onslaughts.
Mr Trump deserves credit for getting the Taliban to the negotiating table. US officials have been talking with Taliban leaders in the Qatar capital, Doha, for a year. In February, they agreed all US troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan “within 14 months”. That timetable meant 4500 US troops would remain until May 1 next year. Before this month’s US presidential election, however, Mr Trump tweeted “we should have the small number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas”. National security adviser Robert O’Brien subsequently indicated the 4500 troops would be reduced to 2500 by early next year.
After the election Mr Trump fired US defence secretary Mark Esper, who had warned strongly against withdrawing American forces too soon and leaving the field open to extremist Islamist forces. Reflecting Mr Trump’s preference, Mr Esper’s successor as Defence Secretary, Christopher Miller, last week sent a memo to all US forces indicating bringing troops home was his top priority. “Now is the time to come home,” he wrote. “This fight has been long, our sacrifices have been enormous and many are weary of war. I’m one of them,” he added. Pentagon officials believe Mr Miller is under intense White House pressure to wrap up in Afghanistan as well as in Iraq, where the US still has 5200 troops, before Mr Trump leaves office, thereby helping secure his presidential legacy.
Apart from Mr Miller’s injudicious confession of “war weariness” while US negotiators are still trying to wring a peace deal out of the Taliban, Mr Trump would be wise not to insist on an early deadline to meet his political imperatives. The 4500 troop number Mr Trump agreed to earlier was based on carefully considered strategic recommendations by the US commander in the field supported by US Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Mark Milley.
The cost of an even earlier withdrawal, it was believed, would be to seriously imperil all that US and allied forces, including our Diggers, have achieved across 19 years. With the UN reporting the Taliban controls at least half of Afghanistan — and with Islamic State and al-Qa’ida attacking at will in the capital, Kabul, and elsewhere — fears are that, without a peace deal with the Taliban, Afghanistan inevitably would revert to being a safe haven for global Islamist terrorism. The Wall Street Journal has warned that “a complete withdrawal all but guarantees a Taliban-ISIS assault on Kabul and a 1975 Saigon-style defeat and humiliation is possible”. The bravery and sacrifices of US forces and their coalition allies from countries such as Australia have achieved an immense amount in combating terrorism in Afghanistan. The embattled nation’s reversion to being a Islamist terrorist sanctuary and a dangerous threat to the world would do nothing for the legacy Mr Trump believes his presidency deserves.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Legal profession should seize the reform initiative	The Australian	Key working relationships in courts and the Bar carry risks Dyson Heydon, former High Court judge and a brilliant legal mind, has been found by an independent inquiry to have engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment of young women. Some worked for him as associates — hand-picked from the ranks of the very best law graduates — after he joined the highest court at the age of 59. The complaints against him are disturbing, they have consistent features, come from multiple sources — several women have been willing to be identified publicly — and rely in some cases on documents and notes made at the time. One promising young lawyer says the experience made her abandon her ambition to become a barrister. Quite apart from the obvious distress of such events, making a complaint against an establishment lawyer can be a career killer. Through his lawyers, Mr Heydon has denied any breach of the law or predatory behaviour and has apologised for any “inadvertent” offence.
The relationship between an associate and a judge has few parallels. The judge in chambers is like a sovereign. A young lawyer anointed as an associate gains an entree to the inner workings of justice and not infrequently goes on to judicial office. Judge and associate spend many hours together working intensely. Today’s apprentice may grow to become a lifelong friend and colleague of the judge. But the gulf in age and influence can be so great that a judge stands almost in loco parentis to an associate, certainly a guardian.
The risk and vulnerability should be obvious. Unlike a major law firm, courts are collegial and have no human resources department. Barristers’ chambers can be a similar danger zone. There is a tradition of the hard-charging, hard-drinking barrister whom young women lawyers learn to avoid, preferably through a friendly warning rather than experience. The law is increasingly female in academia and government but the aggression and high stakes of the Bar still attract more men, and this remains the proving ground for many judicial appointments.
Susan Kiefel, the first female chief justice of Australia, would have been conscious of this history when she made her statement supporting the complainants against Mr Heydon. Her route to the Bar was atypical, a function of having left school at 15. She no doubt has not forgotten her impressions of the freemasonry of the law as a young legal secretary in Brisbane, although her career also shows the positive role of male mentors.
Mr Heydon’s lawyers have pointed out that the finding against their client comes not from open legal proceedings safeguarded by the rules of evidence, but from a confidential administrative inquiry run by a former public servant. However, this was an inquiry of the kind any major workplace might have ordered in similar circumstances, and it was run by Vivienne Thom, who has considerable administrative experience.
Yet the High Court is no ordinary employer. It sits at the apex of our legal system. And although it’s clear the chief justice’s statement is not a judicial ruling, it will look like that to some observers. This creates potential difficulties, especially if, as predicted, there are compensation claims and perhaps police investigations following the complaints against Mr Heydon. Even if a case never reaches the High Court, might proceedings at a lower level be conducted in the shadow of what appears to be a quasi-finding by Australia’s chief justice? This is the background to the suggestion by Arthur Moses and other senior lawyers that a federal judicial commission should be set up to handle such complaints. The idea should not be dismissed out of hand — it is a good-faith response to a serious problem — but inquisitorial bodies of this kind bring their own vices and conflicts. Nor are they likely to achieve much if the legal profession fails to reform its own culture. It’s been said that Mr Dyson’s behaviour was an “open secret”. This should prompt some reflection. Lawyers prize their independence but another hallmark of a profession is serious self-regulation and robust standards of conduct. Members of the profession may be better placed than an inflexible institution to drive reform. And although the complaints put Chief Justice Kiefel in an awkward position, her statement of “extreme concern” about the findings against Mr Heydon is a reformist precedent at the highest institutional level of the law. It’s a necessary first step.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
FROM THE EDITOR Chance to make a change to humanity	Wanganui Chronicle	Kia ora kōutou
This morning I happened on a piece from Eckhart Tolle who talked about the opportunity of this “private retreat”.
He continued that at this time of collective adversity affecting billions worldwide, the opportunity is for us to pay more attention to our unconscious projecting into the future.
That causes anxiety and suffering. We can do so much in our private retreats. For those of us working from home, we are adapting to a new way of working.
We still have māhī. I am thankful. Tolle reminds us that we can use this precious time because we are in a time of awakening the consciousness of humanity. On the surface this Level 4 lockdown looks like an obstacle to humanity from a conventional point of view, but it is an opportunity to awaken to a higher level of consciousness. People are reaching out to each other. Friends are asking how they can help.
My niece in Bali sent us a bone broth recipe which is an immunity booster. She is also moving her Pilates online so we can join her in our private retreat.
The human condition to create is another opportunity during this time. We are practising mindfulness. On a collective scale I find that an extraordinary development. It is our awakening consciousness. Our beautiful planet was suffering under the burden of rampant consumerism and lack of mindfulness. The water in the canals in Venice are now running clear. Pollution in China has decreased. The fish have returned to the coast of Italy. This is the new paradigm and the Earth has given us a silver bullet.
It is in our minds where we can make the greatest change to humanity.
Be safe and take care of yourself and each other.
Ngā mihi aroha.

EDITORIAL Time to make a difference and keep local business alive	The Northern Advocate	Kiwis are waking up today ready to start enjoying their first weekend in alert level 2 and properly out of lockdown.
Our freedom of movement is back (nationally, at least), we are free to socialise outside our bubbles (albeit only in groups of 10 or less for now), and the bulk of workers will be returning to the office or workplace on Monday — at the same time as most children return to school or early childhood facilities. The new ‘safer normal’ has begun.
What a difference an alert level makes.
For many businesses, however, alert level 2 will not reverse the effects of the lockdown, and is instead the start of a long, slow, difficult road to recovery — particularly for those still most affected by social-distancing rules, such as the hospitality sector, and those most affected by our border closure, notably the aviation and tourism sectors.
While some businesses have managed to hold out, or have been kept afloat by the government wage subsidy scheme and other financial support measures, the weeks, months and years ahead will be testing. Some businesses will inevitably fail, some may only just remain viable, and it is likely many won’t return to comfortable profit margins for a long time.
But, rather than feel helpless and hopeless, this is the time we as individuals can make a difference — particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises, the economic backbone of the country.
The Northern Advocate’s Go Local! campaign — launched as the country moved into alert level 3 — is a call to action for people and businesses to support businesses in their community, by buying locally or New Zealand-made products, instead of spending with overseas companies. Now, in level 2, we can start supporting, in person, the likes of cafes and restaurants, as well as many more retailers, too.
Many of these smaller operators have needed to innovate almost overnight, developing websites to advertise their goods and services and finding ways to sell and deliver to customers in a contactless manner under level 3, and are now adjusting to level 2 requirements.
The least we can do is provide support in a targeted way that gets money flowing again and helps kick-start the economy.
And for those people who have the time, money and ability to travel now domestic restrictions have been lifted, get in behind our Go NZ! campaign, too, launched before lockdown started, to highlight the options for staycations in our own backyards.
Just remember the level 2 rules that now apply around physical distancing, congregating, good health and hygiene, and diarying your movements.
We have battled a global health crisis, endured unprecedented social restrictions, and face the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression.
Our challenges are far from over but, as our team of 5 million has shown over seven weeks, together we can make a difference.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

Wanted: leadership to tap Queensland’s potential	The Australian	Labor governing with the Greens would be a catastrophe
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and her Labor team were not ready for government when they surprisingly trumped the competent but abrasive Campbell Newman in February 2015. Judging on performance, they are still not ready. Apart from the visionary 10.2km Cross River Rail system to be finished in 2024, it would be difficult to list a single substantial achievement of the past two terms. The wheels have turned in education and health, where the government has done its job. But the overarching narrative of the Palaszczuk years adds up to centralism, bigger government, trade union domination, cronyism and scandals. Long before COVID-19 was heard of, red ink had become the new black of its budget management; shuffling government debt is a subspecialty.
Under the cover of COVID, the government’s failure to deliver a budget before the election is one of the disgraces in public administration in Australia in recent years. It is indicative of the Palaszczuk government’s incompetence and lack of confidence in its finances. The Morrison government, in contrast, was upfront with the public before the last federal election. It brought forward its 2019 budget to April 2 and it served as the Coalition’s manifesto for the May 18 election. If Labor wins on Saturday, the public will have to wait until November 30 to see the state’s books. It could be an ugly set of numbers. At last count, as Sarah Elks reported this week, the state’s debt is forecast to rise to at least $102bn by mid-next year. Most of it was accumulated before COVID.
Through it all, Ms Palaszczuk has developed into a formidable politician, tapping into the populist parochialism that has been intrinsic to Queensland’s political culture for generations. Pushing ahead of schedule on euthanasia has provoked divisions, including among rusted-on Labor supporters. Her instincts — and expensive taxpayer-funded market research, which has been hidden from the public — have guided her response to the coronavirus pandemic. Her catchcry, “all about protecting Queenslanders’’, has occasionally gone too far. Last month, her selfish “in Queensland, we have Queensland hospitals for our people’’ stance stirred consciences after the death of an unborn twin whose mother, from northern NSW, was unable to quickly access the expert medical help she needed in Brisbane. In the absence of substantial economic achievement, however, COVID-19 has been a handy campaign crutch for Ms Palaszczuk. But, while many regard her COVID policies as a positive for her re-election chances, keeping the state’s borders locked down for months longer than necessary has decimated the tourism and hospitality sector, especially among small businesses in the regions. The high cost of Labor’s COVID policy is evident in Queensland’s 7.7 per cent jobless rate, the worst of any state or territory. Victoria, with 6.7 per cent unemployment, fared better last month. However bleak the picture in the north, it could be worse. After Saturday, Ms Palaszczuk and Opposition Leader Deb Frecklington could find themselves in a hung parliament, scrambling for support to form government. Both refuse to entertain such a notion publicly. But a Labor-Greens alliance would have all the problems of the Gillard-Greens minority government writ large. In a state that remains overly dependent on coal royalties and LNG exports, Greens policies designed to bring stasis to the mining sector would plunge an already shaky economy into penury. The Greens’ platform amounts to enormous taxation and gargantuan spending. Their policies would triple mining royalties, levy banks and developers and lavish spending on 100,000 public housing dwellings and much else. In any alliance or balance-of-power arrangement, Katter’s Australian Party, which has three seats, would also have a costly list of demands to benefit its northern base.
Savvy Queenslanders understand private industry, and not the public sector, is the engine room of investment, growth and job creation. Over the past five years, many people north of the Tweed have looked on in envy as the Baird then Berejiklian governments invested the proceeds of asset leases and sales in NSW and created the conditions for business, enterprise and aspiration to flourish. Ms Palaszczuk, in contrast, seems bent on taking Queensland back 50 or 60 years, when a steady job in the public service was what many working families aspired to for their children. The public sector needs good people and some thrive in it. Today’s youngsters deserve as wide a range of options as possible, however. As the third-largest state in the nation, and therefore too big to fail, Queensland needs a government with big ambition for a state that is so rich in mineral resources; agriculture; water, especially in the north; tourist attractions; decentralised transport and university infrastructure and the potential to build on its underdeveloped industrial base in centres such as Gladstone. Premier Wayne Goss, who in 1989 ousted the Nationals after 32 years, came to government with a vision to put the state’s corrupt underbelly to rights and to modernise the economy, including the industrial base. Peter Beattie’s Smart State vision fostered local expertise in medical and scientific research and high-technology value-added industries. The legacies of both former Labor premiers endure.
As they face the future after COVID, voters looking for a circuit breaker will struggle to find it in the LNP. Ms Frecklington, who is not dissimilar in age and background to Ms Palaszczuk, has established herself as a leader. She did well to see off the absurdity of former LNP president and Clive Palmer staffer Dave Hutchinson serving two masters while trying to destabilise her leadership. If elected, she would step up to the role of premier, as Ms Palaszczuk did. Policy, not personality, is the LNP’s weak spot.
Queensland needs a safer pair of hands on the economic reins and the LNP should be able to provide them. It would have the advantage of not being beholden to the self-interest of trade unions. The Palaszczuk government’s talent base is alarmingly narrow. Ten of the cabinet of 18 were union officials or delegates before entering parliament and five were political advisers. The LNP’s base is broader. Its policies are costed, although two key promises — widening the Bruce Highway to four lanes from Gympie to Cairns (which is long overdue) and the new Bradfield irrigation scheme for northwest Queensland — are 15 years away and depend on federal support. Releasing the LNP costings on Friday, shadow treasurer Tim Mander played up the party’s intention to find $800m in efficiency savings in the public sector over four years. Mr Mander’s pledge that “there will be no asset sales, nor will there be any forced redundancies”, however, will make funding the state’s COVID recovery and budget repair extremely challenging. In its eagerness not to repeat the perceived mistakes of the Newman years, the LNP, unwisely, locked itself into opposing privatisation early on in opposition. Like Labor, it lacks a proper budget repair strategy. Queenslanders should have no illusions, however. Without judicious asset sales and leases, which helped kickstart the impressive development in NSW in recent years, the economic road back for Queensland will be long and hard. The AAA credit rating is moving further out of reach with every budget. Next week, after 3.3 million votes in 93 electorates have been counted, Queensland will embark on its first four-year parliament. That break with tradition will be an opportunity for the incoming government to take a longer-term view of the state’s needs and opportunities. Broadening its economic base is essential. The new government would also do well to revisit the strategy that worked so well for the Goss government’s treasurer from 1989 to 1996, businessman Keith De Lacy. Based on low taxes and good financial management, it was designed to optimise the environment to allow business to flourish, limiting government interference. At its heart was a “fiscal trilogy” to deter big-spending ministers. It involved fully funding long-term liabilities such as superannuation; funding social capital such as schools and hospitals from recurrent revenue and borrowing only for commercial assets that could service their debt. The Palaszczuk government lacks the vision and strategy to take the state forward. Five years is enough; it does not deserve nine years. The LNP has not impressed from opposition. But, on balance, we believe voters would do well to back it as a better option.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Setting aside tribalism for great adventure of growth	The Australian	Labor has a chance to contribute to better policy outcomes
In a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia on Monday, Scott Morrison rekindled a slogan from one of our most influential economists. CEDA’s founder, Sir Douglas Copland, an academic, bureaucrat and diplomat, tirelessly preached the “adventure of growth”. The Prime Minister said it was a quest that aligns with today’s challenge as we look to recover from twin crises due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr Morrison pledged to go for growth and jobs with a five-year plan he has termed JobMaker. He recently set out a skills agenda and a goal for an industrial relations compact. The latest moves involve deregulation and delivering infrastructure.
Mr Morrison has an ambitious goal. He wants the nation to get back to the pre-pandemic growth trajectory by 2025. It will require us to lift our growth rate by more than one percentage point above trend, which is around 3.5 per cent for five years. He said compared with the mid-year budget update it is expected that more than $100bn of economic activity has been lost this year and it will take us an estimated two years at least just to get back to the level of gross domestic product we were at pre COVID-19. However, nonpartisan economists are sceptical about hitting the targets, labelling them a “stretch”. Eight years is a likelier period to return to the previous trajectory on GDP.
Mr Morrison has vowed to make the economy run faster to get people back to work, not through fiscal stimulus but by addressing supply-side factors such as skills, workplace flexibility, red-tape reduction, infrastructure provision and federal-state financial relations. The economy faces a moment of truth when the emergency funding measures taper off in September. The government is correctly highlighting the need to live within our means, given the expected weakness in revenue for some years. The Parliamentary Budget Office has forecast a decade of fiscal deficits and an additional $500bn to $620bn of net debt because of COVID-19. Rather than austerity or higher taxes, the strategy is to clear regulatory blockages and improve the dynamism of the economy to get growth humming.
It’s important to recall that before the crisis hit, the economy was merely meandering along at sub-2 per cent annual GDP growth. Activity was juiced up by population growth, surging exports, big-ticket state capital works and expanding bureaucracy in health, welfare and disability services. But parts of the economy were stagnant or in decline, including consumer spending, business investment and the housing industry. Productivity was on the slide, the key behind insipid wage growth. It’s worth recounting a controversial, if devastating, observation Copland made in 1949. He argued Australia postwar was a “milk-bar economy”, and the nation needed a plan to produce more capital goods for expansion rather than focusing on consumer essentials.
As we argued on Friday, investment is the missing ingredient in our growth formula. Mr Morrison told the CEDA event reforms to unshackle state and federal planning and environmental laws could see approval times for major projects cut in half to 21 months. The idea is to establish taskforces composed of federal and state regulators for each of 15 major projects — including metro rail, dams, mines and roads — to work with proponents, abolishing the many hoops required. A federal review into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is expected to recommend cutting green tape to speed up project approvals. Mr Morrison said national cabinet will try to change the culture of regulators as well as the content of regulations. “This crisis has shown what can be achieved when regulators are pragmatic and responsive, solving problems without compromising safeguards,” he said. The Productivity Commission is wisely being brought into the heart of the national cabinet-led reform model to advise on a whole range of issues. But we also need pragmatic and responsive legislators. The past two decades show that hyper-partisanship, fratricide and minor-player veto have killed the impetus for reform, from lower taxes to more flexible workplace laws. As an acute observer and key political player over many years, Labor leader Anthony Albanese understands the roots of Canberra’s dysfunction. He and his party have an opportunity to positively contribute to the adventure of growth by putting down their cudgels and seeking common ground — and using their influence to make policies better, fairer and more forward-looking. This will involve all players setting aside the habits and prejudices of their political careers to work in the national interest for broadbased, sustainable, business-led economic revival. We live in hope.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Dog whistles on migration endanger jobs and growth	The Australian	Labor has a long, dishonourable history on foreign workers
In budget week three years ago, Labor tried to steal voter attention with a shameful foray into two-dollar-shop Hansonism. Bill Shorten fronted an almost all-white cast in an “Australia First” ad campaign that called on employers to employ Australians first. Anthony Albanese called the ad a “shocker” and said it should never have been made or shown. Perhaps it was just a sniping shot at his leadership rival rather than a statement of principle. Jolted by the jury of social media, Mr Shorten promised the lapse wouldn’t happen again. That lamentable 2017 episode comes to mind because Labor’s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, has reprised the dog whistle. US-born Senator Keneally, who also has carriage of immigration and citizenship, called for a policy rethink on foreign workers. “We need a migration program that puts Australian workers first,” she wrote last weekend.
Can this junk be coming from the party of free-market globalists Bob Hawke and Paul Keating and soft-left multiculturalists Penny Wong and Tanya Plibersek? Well, yes. Not that long ago Julia Gillard, born in Wales, played the Aussie jobs card in cracking down on 457 visas. The then prime minister’s spin Svengali was himself an imported temporary visa holder, as if the dark arts are in short supply here. Irony, meet hypocrisy. Still, what is it with NSW Labor leaders dabbling in nativism? Last year, then opposition leader Michael Daley was humiliated, while killing Labor’s electoral chances against Gladys Berejiklian, in claiming Asians were stealing the jobs of young Australians. His desperate predecessor, Luke Foley, in 2015 tried to inflame anti-Chinese sentiment to thwart Mike Baird’s “poles and wires” privatisation. Former NSW premier Bob Carr has called out this nasty strain in his party.
As the political wing of the trade union movement, Labor has form on denying entry to foreign workers. At its first election in 1891 the Labour Electoral League of NSW, as it was then known, campaigned on excluding Chinese workers and “stamping Chinese-made furniture”. Over our history, when we’ve been hit by economic calamity — the 1890s, after the 1930s Depression and the recessions of the early 80s and 90s — we’ve pressed the pause button on migration. The ensuing pain has been deeper, leading to years if not decades of lost opportunity. Although John Howard had taken a hard line against Asian migration in opposition, and in office ran a tough border regime, he was without fanfare the champion of front-door high immigration in the wake of Pauline Hanson’s insurgency.
Our population grew by 371,000, or 1.5 per cent, to 25.5 million over the year to last September, of which 63 per cent was due to net overseas migration. In the past few years, with net overseas migration peaking at 240,000 last financial year, we had our lowest jobless rates. Now the Morrison government expects overseas migration to decrease by 30 per cent this year; in 2020-21, net migration will be 36,000 or 85 per cent below the recent high, the lowest figure in 40 years, as tourism and education are battered. Already, temporary visa holders have abandoned Australia; in the first 15 weeks of the year, 310,000 departed, according to official figures obtained by this newspaper. That’s understandable, with holiday-makers and students returning home because of COVID-19 shutdowns and the like.
But with foreigners not qualifying for income support, it’s expected that 300,000 more could leave the country by the end of this year. The stampede out of Australia could further erode consumer demand and cause a slump in the rental and housing markets. That will crush confidence and put a clamp on the recovery, especially in home construction. Some argue we have relied too much on population growth to stoke our economy in recent times. It’s showing up as a slide in per capita income over several years. According to the budget papers, more than 800,000 net new immigrants were forecast during the next three years. The resistance to more migrants, a backlash against “Big Australia” especially in our cities, is due to the long-term failure of governments to provide infrastructure and enable home building. To his discredit, in 2005 Mr Carr declared Sydney was “full”.Yet, as economist Chris Richardson warned, reducing migration is “bad economics”, hurting at least as much as it helps. He said while strict travel bans to protect our health were sensible, “thinking it protects jobs and workers just doesn’t make sense”. “The smart response would be to get young skilled migrants coming to Australia to help raise living standards here, as well as those of the new arrivals,” he told us. That has been this newspaper’s bedrock principle since 1964. Migration will help ease the looming ageing crunch; it has enriched the nation in myriad ways. In any case, the COVID-19 policy-induced contraction will cut demand for foreign workers. After the crisis we need a revamped economy to roar back to life. The competition for smart, skilled workers will be intense. Gold-star pandemic management and healthcare should be a pull factor. We want as many of them — PhDs, STEM wizards, start-up entrepreneurs, as well as nurses and mechanics — to choose us, to make lives here and to feel welcome.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
No smoking gun yet on rorts	The Australian	Labor has not implicated Mr Morrison but the row goes on
Despite Labor’s claims, the opposition does not have a smoking gun showing Scott Morrison misled parliament over the sports rorts saga. The scandal further evolved on Monday night when the Australian National Audit Office told Senate estimates that former sports minister Bridget ­McKenzie notified Sport Australia of new funding approvals as late as 12.43pm on April 11 last year, after the 2019 election had been called that morning. But at this stage it is not clear that the caretaker convention, which relates to major policy decisions, was broken.
ANAO executive director Brian Boyd told Senate estimates that Sport Australia received several versions of Senator McKenzie’s colour-coded sports grants spreadsheet the day the election was called. The final spreadsheet, in which “one project came out and further projects came in”, was sent to Sport Australia at 12.43pm. Shortly before, at 12.35pm, “it was sent from the minister’s office to the Prime Minister’s office”. The Pennant Hills AFL club, in the safe Liberal seat of Berowra in northern Sydney, was added after parliament entered caretaker mode. That was hardly an electoral bribe.
Nor is there anything to negate the Prime Minister’s insistence that Senator McKenzie ultimately approved projects. His office, he said, merely provided information to her office, based on representations made to it. Anthony Albanese’s claim that Mr Morrison’s role was “the most direct involvement of a prime minister in a scandal that I have seen” looks hollow.Mr Boyd told Senate estimates the ANAO was aware of correspondence between the offices of Senator McKenzie and Mr Morrison about the sports grants program on messaging platforms beyond the 136 emails it accessed. The scandal claimed Senator McKenzie’s scalp. But so far, Labor has not justified its repeated claim that Mr Morrison has misled parliament and the public. Given major issues currently in play, such as the economy and the coronavirus outbreak, Labor should be careful about overplaying the sports rorts. Unless it finds something stronger than it has produced to date.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Investment and workplace relations key to new jobs	The Australian	Labor needs to be upfront about the cost of its portable leave scheme
The nation is far from full employment, but the jobs market has built up strong momentum, with more than twice as many jobseekers exiting the dole as signing on to it last month. This is good news for taxpayers. Department of Social Services data shows more than 100,000 people dropped off JobSeeker and Youth Allowance payments last month, the sharpest fall since the start of the pandemic a year ago. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe expects the jobless rate could “blip” higher for a month or two after JobKeeper ends at the end of March. But he tipped last week that unemployment would fall to 6 per cent by late this year, compared with 6.6 per cent last December.
Even when JobKeeper comes to an end, the economy has plenty of scope for further jobs growth, as Finance Minister Simon Birmingham will detail in an address to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce on Friday. In his first major speech in the portfolio, Senator Birmingham will point out that with many employers “crying out for workers”, the government must help Australians — including hundreds of thousands of people on JobSeeker who are single, with no children and no impediments to work — fill the available jobs.
ANZ job advertisements increased in January for the eighth consecutive month, to their highest level since April 2019. In addition to the agriculture industry, which needs another 26,000 workers in the absence of international visitors, vacancies are also plentiful in mining and drilling, construction, cleaning companies, in the crucial care sectors and in tourism regions where domestic tourism has recovered.
The Morrison government is weighing up the benefits of a permanent ­increase to the dole and more support for struggling businesses after its COVID-19 support payments cease. Australian National University researcher Ben Phillips is correct when he says some families would face “pretty serious financial stress” if welfare numbers did not return to pre-pandemic levels and the JobSeeker rate remained at about $565 a fortnight. All of which underlines the importance of jobs growth.
Several factors will be crucial in encouraging it. First, as Senator Birmingham says, the government must continue to encourage investment and boost business confidence. Second, states need to avoid costly border closures and lockdowns at the first signs of isolated COVID-19 breakouts. According to Queensland Tourism Industry Council head Daniel Gschwind, border closures and lockdowns cost his state’s tourism industry as much as $20bn last year. And third, because much of the growth that has helped 553,000 Australians find work in the past five months has been in blue-collar industries that rely on casual workers, the workplace relations system must have the flexibility to maximise job opportunities in sectors such as labouring, cleaning, sales, hospitality and factory work. Reforms need to break down barriers to jobs while providing fairness and certainty for workers.
The Morrison government’s proposed industrial relations reforms, developed after more than 150 consultations with employer and employee groups, would be a step in the right direction. The reforms include long-overdue initiatives such as simplification of awards in the retail and hospitality sectors; the wider use of project-life greenfields agreements that would include guaranteed wage increases; providing a pathway for those working regular casual shifts to convert to permanent roles after 12 months if they wish; and stern measures to reduce the risk of wage underpayments by employers. The legislation is being examined by a Senate committee and will be voted on after the committee reports in the middle of next month. Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter is likely to make changes to the bill, Ewin Hannan writes on Friday. Contentious changes to the Fair Work Act’s “better off overall” test seem likely to be dumped.
Labor is planning to make workplace relations a key battlefield at the next election. Opposition climate spokesman Chris Bowen urged his party this week to “listen to the suburbs” and respond to the anxiety many voters feel about job insecurity, declining industries and rising inequality. But if the opposition’s workplace relations policy is to have credibility, it too must optimise the climate for business investment and jobs growth. But it is built, unfortunately, around greater regulation of workplaces and less flexibility. This is the antithesis of what the post-COVID economy needs if Australia is to return to full or near full employment. As Dr Lowe says, a tighter labour market will be needed to generate the wage rises workers want Good pay rises, in turn, would help fuel demand, spending and further growth.
Employer groups are concerned, as Hannan reported on Thursday, that Labor’s portable leave policy for employees in “insecure work” could result in a “very large” levy on business. It also would involve extra administration costs and red tape. Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox fears the plan could add 10 to 11 per cent to the wages bill of employers, operating as “a tax on employment” and destroying jobs and investment. Mr Porter and Anthony Albanese have launched a war of words over the cost of Labor’s portable leave proposal. On Thursday, Mr Porter released costings from the Attorney-General’s Department in support of his claim the proposal could cost employers $20bn. That figure assumes every one of Australia’s 2.3 million casual workers and one million independent contractors would be entitled to four weeks’ annual leave and two weeks of personal/carers leave a year. The Opposition Leader dismissed the estimate as a joke, claiming the government “just makes up figures as if they get them out of a cereal box in the morning”. He says Labor’s plan is to consult with states, employers and unions to develop portable entitlements where it is practical. The onus is now on him to set out the likely costs and parameters of the policy and its effects on jobs growth. Businesses recovering from the fallout from the pandemic have good reason to be sceptical.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Recovery still requires commitment to reforms	The Australian	Labor signals that it is gearing up to fight industrial relations changes Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe has given an upbeat assessment of how Australia’s economy is bouncing back from the pandemic. Jobs growth and business activity are returning faster than the RBA’s most optimistic earlier forecasts.
In a speech to the National Press Club, Dr Lowe gave households and business a clear signal that low interest rates would continue for some years, providing confidence to plan and invest. Higher house prices will not force the RBA to change course because, on balance, rising asset values are still considered a positive thing for jobs growth and activity in the wider economy due to the greater financial confidence they give to homeowners. The federal government can accept Dr Lowe’s comments as confirmation that its COVID-19 response and recovery strategy is working. But this is not justification for complacency, to give in to demands that welfare spending be extended beyond what is necessary, or give up on the difficult task of reform. A durable recovery will require more than rising house prices.
Included in Dr Lowe’s assessment was a warning that continued strong expansion was not guaranteed. With substantial spare capacity left in the economy, there was still quite a way to go before the RBA reached its goals of full employment and inflation consistent with its target. The unemployment rate is higher today than it has been for almost two decades, and the upcoming national accounts for the December quarter are likely to show the level of gross domestic product is 4 per cent lower than where the RBA thought it would be a year ago. Dr Lowe said underlying inflation was running at 1.25 per cent, well below the medium-term target of 2 per cent to 3 per cent, and wage growth was the lowest in decades. Future uncertainty is even more reason for the government to push ahead with reforms that build productivity.
One obvious area is industrial relations, where the government has put forward an omnibus bill of modest measures that is shaping as a key political battleground. As workplace editor Ewin Hannan reported on Wednesday, Labor says it will oppose the Coalition’s entire IR bill despite it containing measures that it normally would be expected to support, such as criminalising wage theft. Labor’s position is more extraordinary given Senate hearings into the legislation are not due to start until next week. ACTU president Michele O’Neil has said unions wanted significant amendments, and a review of the bill by the Australia Institute has said the government’s proposal will give COVID-stressed employers more power to bypass the Fair Work Act’s “better off overall” test and “open the floodgates” for employers to rush the approval of non-union enterprise agreements that undercut award wages.
Scott Morrison says the government is taking a centre line, having already rejected more extreme changes that some groups had been seeking. The Prime Minister told parliament Labor was “overreaching” in its opposition to the IR changes. The Morrison government already has signalled it is willing to reconsider the limited changes to the BOOT to aid the passage of reform. It will now negotiate with the crossbenchers for support. The ALP is giving all the signals it wants to dig in for a fight to replay the Work Choices battle that helped deliver it government against John Howard. Anthony Albanese appears to be crafting his election approach based on the twin messages of “It’s Time” and a re-run of Work Choices. His message to families is Labor is “on your side”. Mr Albanese told caucus: “At the next election, Scott Morrison will be asking for the Libs and Nats to have more time in office than John Howard had.” He simultaneously launched a negative attack against the Coalition for having an agenda with “cuts to JobKeeper, cuts to JobSeeker and cuts to wages”. The ALP used question time on Tuesday and Wednesday to quiz the government about why part-time workers in care industries would be substantially worse off under the proposed IR reforms. The government and employer groups have accused Labor of misrepresenting the detail of the proposed changes. Mr Morrison is building the case for workplace flexibility against the warnings from the RBA, repeated by Dr Lowe on Wednesday, that labour markets and wages growth remain weak. The government must stick to its guns on IR reform, which is all about getting more Australians back into work.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Albanese’s budget speech blues far from in the pink	The Australian	Labor would increase the government’s economic footprint Almost 50 years ago, the Whitlam government’s progressive policies of providing maternity leave, equal pay and removing discrimination against women in the federal public service left the Coalition looking out of touch and old-fashioned. The worm has turned. Women, Anthony Albanese said in his budget reply speech on Thursday night, were at the heart of Labor’s plan to “kickstart the economy and get Australians back to work”. Then followed the opposition’s extravagant childcare pitch, aimed at introducing a 90 per cent subsidy for all families. It would leave some up to $2900 a year better off. “In the worst recession for 100 years we have to make sure women aren’t forced to choose between their families and their jobs,” the Opposition Leader said. The plan would suit potential beneficiaries but leave most taxpayers shouldering a heavy burden. And its narrow focus is no strategy for rebuilding an economy ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The days of pitching to women as an enfeebled, disadvantaged minority are long gone. Labor’s quaint critique of the Morrison government, that “we can’t have a pink recession and a blue recovery”, is an anachronism. Even more pathetic was Mr Albanese’s line in the budget reply speech: “Women have suffered most during the pandemic but are reduced to a footnote. The best the government can offer is they can drive on a road.” Huh? As Scott Morrison “mansplained” in question time on Wednesday: “It may come as some surprise to the Leader of the Opposition but women run small businesses … Women pay tax. Women hire other Australians in their businesses.” As well as wanting safe roads, the Prime Minister said, women “want to go to university, and they want to study science and technology and engineering and maths, like the Industry Minister did. They want to get apprenticeships. They want to get traineeships. They want to get jobs”. Mr Albanese’s implicit suggestion that women have nothing to gain from Josh Frydenberg’s budget strategy of enhancing conditions for private sector investment, growth and job creation harks back to the working world of our grandparents.
While claiming, falsely, that “the only legacy of the budget is trillion-dollar debt”, Mr Albanese did not critique the Treasurer’s business strategy directly. And he shares the government’s concerns about the importance of skills training, pointing to the shortages of nurses, welders, bricklayers, engineers and hairdressers. With several years of negative net migration ahead, redressing those shortages will be vital to growth. Our nation has been built and strengthened on various waves of skilled immigration. Sooner rather than later the pattern will need to resume. A considered, updated strategy of Peter Costello’s “one for Mum, one for Dad and one for the country” might not go amiss either, given the challenges created by our ageing population.
The speech showed Mr Albanese would not be averse to venturing down the path of “picking winners” with taxpayers’ money and increasing government interference in the productive economy. In an ideal world, the $270bn worth of defence spending on the books should open the way for developing our sovereign industrial and research capabilities and build skills and building expertise within the Australian workforce, as Mr Albanese said. Improving the nation’s defence preparedness, however, must never be used as a “make-work scheme”. That error has been made before by both sides of politics.
Mr Albanese’s vision for a national rail manufacturing plan may or may not stand scrutiny. He wants a national audit of passenger train capacity and condition, to develop a rail procurement and manufacturing strategy and to assess how the sphere can go about fostering jobs, research and development and export opportunities. The starting point would need to be a thorough cost-benefit analysis. If Australia, under either side of politics, is to expand manufacturing, a modernised, flexible industrial relations system and an energy policy that allows companies access to cheap power will be fundamental to success. Mr Albanese’s lament over the demise of the car industry in Australia was conveniently selective. The price of propping it up was vast. The nation would venture down the old-fashioned protectionist path again at our peril.
Mr Albanese’s call for the repair of social housing, which is badly run down in many areas, is a good one. And the states, which are responsible for social housing, should get on with it, boosting tradies’ order books, demand for labourers and apprentices and new tools and equipment. The states would need to weigh up Mr Albanese’s call for 200,000 new public housing dwellings to be built, with a view to its impact on the property market. His pledge of an Australian Centre for Disease Control makes sense, provided it would not duplicate existing research efforts. While attempting to deride the government’s projected debt levels, Mr Albanese’s alternative policies would increase, not diminish, public sector interference in the economy. He also was notably quiet on tax policy. Like Bill Shorten last year, his vision offered little reward for enterprise and effort but more “government knows best”. Labor needs to rediscover the power of aspiration and incentive.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Abandon workplace wars for post-virus jobs growth	The Australian	Labor’s old guard struggles to shape new industrial compact ACTU secretary Sally McManus was right to declare in our pages on Thursday that as we contemplate the mammoth challenge of rebuilding Australia’s economy, “it’s become clear that there is no going back to business as usual”. Unemployment is still rising, companies are failing, investment has slumped and vast areas of industry are on life support. Our industrial relations have regressed, exacerbating conflict and entrenching tribalism. Scott Morrison has urged trade unions and employers to put down their weapons and find common ground. That’s the new spirit his government will try to encourage as a facilitator of five working groups in coming months to make workplace relations fit for purpose in a post-pandemic rebuild.
Something was needed to break the sclerosis at the workplace, and the Prime Minister has pursued a middle-of-the-road path. The big-bang reform of John Howard’s Work Choices and steady union-directed re-regulation of the workplace under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard bequeathed a sick, hybrid enterprise bargaining system with multiple comorbidities: overly complex awards (and too many of them), an absurd “better off overall” test for new agreements, and the world’s highest minimum wage, to name but a few ills. Several thorough reports detected systemic blockages, but the Coalition had become timid, while Labor under Bill Shorten had settled on full-scale class war: a “living wage” by fiat and a shifty fix of the workplace rules to benefit its industrial wing. A year ago, mainstream voters rebuffed this suspect redistribution agenda and put their trust in Mr Morrison’s more orthodox economic management and aspiration.
This middle-of-the-road approach to workplace reform is not a variant of Bob Hawke’s Prices and Incomes Accord model of almost four decades ago. How could it be, given institutional makeover, the Coalition in power and a minimalist role of unions in economic affairs? Mr Morrison’s compact is alive to the near impossibility of achieving meaningful legislative change with a fractious Senate. Witness the Canberra palaver in trying to put limits on the lawlessness of rogue construction unions. To the chagrin of employers and his own MPs, Mr Morrison has set aside the Ensuring Integrity bill. Ms McManus has recognised the merit of employer concerns over the “better off overall” test and inefficiencies and delays in the bargaining process. The coming talks will involve give and take, but the national interest demands a new order that encourages job creation. Labor is struggling to find its balance and a positive role during this peace. When Anthony Albanese was elected Labor leader, he vowed to ditch class fury and support policies that aided output growth — rather than continue Labor’s redistribution fetish. The Opposition Leader is not completely shut out of the reform process, given Labor eventually will vote on any new industrial legislation. But the early signs are not promising, as many in Labor’s political show have built brands on “fighting Tories”. ALP national president Wayne Swan, an inveterate class warrior even when federal treasurer, is again rattling the tin for donations: “We’re fighting against vested interests with deep pockets who will use this pandemic to drive down wages and conditions.” Mr Albanese’s challenge is to show he is committed to jobs and recovery, not reviving ancient battles in these calamitous times.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics

Is Matariki holiday good for business?	The New Zealand Herald	Labour’s promise to make Matariki a public holiday by 2022 has drawn criticism for being poorly timed, due to the Covid crisis and the challenges facing business.
It’s also been labelled an election bribe, even though calls to make it a holiday have been growing louder every year for a decade or more. Not surprisingly there is widespread support for the move among the public.
The arguments for and against a Matariki holiday have been well canvassed, including the economic ramifications. Business NZ says more holidays will mean less productivity and greater administrative costs for business, and that is unhelpful in the current economic climate. It is estimated that a public holiday for Matariki will cost employers about $200 million a year.
Yet, the costs of adding an extra holiday are much less invasive than, say, hiking corporate taxes, and there are benefits to certain sectors such as domestic tourism — although politicians should be careful not to overplay that card.
According to a study by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER), domestic tourism contributed $65 million of spending per day on average in 2019.
“Some commentators have called for creation of new public holidays to help this process, but at 2019’s rate an extra public holiday would increase tourism expenditure by the equivalent of only 0.4 per cent of the international tourism loss,” NZIER said in its recent Tourism beyond Covid-19 report.
“An extra day’s holiday would need to generate far more than domestic tourism’s average daily spend to make an appreciable impact on plugging the hole in tourism revenues.”
The question of productivity is even more complex. New Zealand’s lower productivity is not necessarily attributed to working fewer hours (Kiwis actually work comparatively long hours), but more to the output from those hours, which opens up a whole other debate, perhaps with new data stemming from increased working from home during lockdowns.
There are other factors to consider: Traffic congestion, for example, costs Auckland’s economy at least $1.3b a year according to an NZIER report commissioned by the EMA.
And businesses have taken on an increasing burden over the past 10 years, including time-and-a-half payments for working on a public holiday, an increase in annual leave to four weeks, increasing KiwiSaver employer contributions, increased compliance costs and increases to the minimum wage. These are all necessary enhancements to employment law but there must be some leeway given to small business in other areas.
If the Government is to make Matariki a holiday it should also review problems with the Holidays Act which have been a nightmare for businesses grappling with historical holiday leave underpayments.
At least get that right before introducing more hardship on an already stretched business community.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Trace Covid-19 cases, not harmless leaks in Victoria	The Australian	Lack of transparency often leads to bad decisions and waste If the Andrews government were as energetic about improving its contact tracing of coronavirus cases as it is about tracing media leaks, Victorians and the nation would be far better off. As Ewin Hannan reports, a public servant is under investigation by Victoria Police’s E-Crime Squad for the alleged leaking of documents to the Herald Sun revealing the state government’s “road map to recovery’’. The newspaper published the much sought-after information on September 3, days ahead of a planned announcement by Mr Andrews. At the time, he claimed the documents were out of date and had no status. Apparently not. Given the long-suffering public’s endurance of the lockdown, curfew and restrictions to personal liberty, it would have made more sense if the government had released its draft proposals to allow feedback from those most affected — the public — before announcing the final plan. We are, after all, supposedly “all in this together’’ — until politicians want to hush something up. If Victoria’s contact tracing system were more effective, Mr Andrews would surely have been sufficiently confident to open the economy and allow greater freedom, as has NSW.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is also showing a regrettable penchant for secrecy in relation to COVID-19, despite intense public interest. Her government has refused to release $528,000 worth of taxpayer-funded polling into Queenslanders’ attitudes towards COVID-19. In nine days, Ms Palaszczuk will ask voters to back her handling of the crisis, which she has repeatedly claimed is based on the advice of the state’s Chief Health Officer, Dr Jeannette Young. But Ms Palaszczuk has refused repeatedly to release the polling, which is believed to canvass voter attitudes to controversial issues such as the economically devastating border lockdown. Now her department has refused a Right to Information request by The Australian to release its contract with pollster Ipsos, on the ground it is “confidential” and the pollster needs to be consulted. Rubbish. It was paid for by the public, to canvass public opinion on a matter of public interest. There is no reason for secrecy. “There’s no secrecy,” Ms Palaszczuk told voters while campaigning on Fitzroy Island on the Great Barrier Reef, near Cairns, on Thursday. Yes, Premier. Asked whether the research contained anything controversial she said: “No, there’s nothing.” Then release it.
Ms Palaszczuk has copied the Andrews government in some key policy areas, including euthanasia. If returned on Saturday week, however, she would do her state a grave disservice if she emulated Victoria’s habitual secrecy. Those familiar with the workings of his government would never mistake Mr Andrews’ rambling daily briefings for open government. For example, after almost three months, the Coate inquiry has been unable to get to the bottom of a simple question that should have taken a few hours to answer — who authorised the appointment of private contractors to oversee hotel quarantining?
Less obvious but deeply concerning is Victoria’s veil of secrecy over legal proceedings. Last year, the state granted the highest number of court suppres­sion orders in the nation. The 441 orders granted equalled the number in all other jurisdictions combined and compared with 160 orders in NSW, which had the next-highest number. So far this year, the 235 suppression orders granted in Victoria (not counting 154 orders over matters in the state’s Civil and Administrative Tribunal) compares with 103 in NSW, 122 in South Australia and 11 in Queensland.
For secrecy and catastrophic cover-ups, however, it is impossible to go past the decades-long scandal of Lawyer X (Nicola Gobbo, the former barrister turned police snitch). It amounted to the worst police corruption in the nation’s history, destroyed Victorians’ trust in their police force and will cost the public many millions of dollars. The debacle arose through lack of police and government accountability and transparency. And it came to light only as a result of the efforts of a free press that was much maligned by authorities as revelations emerged. In its desperation to keep its conduct secret, Victoria Police squandered millions of dollars relentlessly pressuring Melbourne’s Herald Sun newspaper, which broke the story of Lawyer X on March 31, 2014. The aim was to force the paper to bury the story, to the immense detriment of the public interest. In the same vein, inquiries into Victoria’s drug squad in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2007 found a “lack of accountability’’ had enabled misconduct and corruption. However annoying for government, business and others, leaks are a healthy part of democracy. So is FOI, when it functions well. Politicians resort to secrecy to conceal what they know voters will not like. But the public is entitled to make informed judgments about those it elects and funds. That is why the right to know is sacrosanct.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
EDITORIAL Locals need to speak up to protect tourists	The Daily Post	Last week there were two near misses on the Waikato River with river-float tourists failing to exit at Hipapatua/Reid’s Farm. Luckily the first group lived to tell the tale about how they went over the Huka Falls on inflatables. In the the other episode, they can talk about how they nearly went over the Huka Falls but were pulled out through a blackberry bush by a police officer.
Other river users at the time were aware the second party had not exited at Hipapatua and were incredibly relieved to later hear about their rescue. Deciding whether to be a bystander or not is really a dilemma to be addressed in advance. If you haven’t considered it before, you probably will not make a snap decision ‘no I am not a bystander, yes I will get involved’ as the tourists are floating past.
It can be hard stepping outside of our comfort zone and interfering in other people’s lives. Living in Taupō, many of us love an outdoor adventure but this can result in us not liking to query others’ knowledge about danger ahead. We may think the tourists have a much higher skill level than us and are about to achieve an amazing feat, or perhaps we think it is their right to choose to do something that we view as potentially dangerous.
Any of the five tourists could have gone home in a body bag. This brings the moral question — a possibly awkward rebuff on the river is better than dealing with grieving parents collecting their loved one’s body. Tourists can be unaware, and so locals should go out of their way to keep them safe.
Similar to the domestic violence campaign It’s Not OK, local people should feel the need to look out for tourists who in their view are heading for trouble. It’s bound to be a thankless task, but preventing an accident seems a small price to pay considering all the cool events and entertainment venues locals get because of the tourists.
As is the way with things, a new resolve to get involved was put to the test the following day.
Our party turned around two tourists who at 4pm were beginning a six-hour trek up a mountain. It was two on two and the tourists had no chance. They were a bit grumpy, but they got to live.
And just as importantly, we get to live with ourselves.

FROM THE EDITOR Go Local. . . we are all essential now	Wanganui Chronicle	Last week, my editorial talked about the importance of shopping locally. This week we are taking it one step further.
The Stratford Press is launching the Go Local campaign, aimed at championing local business and helping our community get through the devastation caused by Covid-19.
We are all familiar with the term essential worker, as it referred to those working throughout level 4 restrictions to keep our country running. From supermarket staff, to farmers, medical workers and cleaners, essential workers were those who we all needed to help us get through.
But in this next stage we are all essential when it comes to ensuring our town, our district and our people are able to carry on through these difficult economic times. Essential worker or not, we are all essential purchasers and consumers when it comes to helping our local economy grow.
Every time you need to purchase goods or services, make sure you consider local businesses and people first.
Ask yourself — is there a local retailer or service provider you can use. If so, please do.
The money you spend then stays in our own economy, it pays the wages of people in your town and then gets spent again in the local community.
Shopping locally doesn’t mean eschewing big box retailers necessarily either. Big box retailers in your own town still employ local people, pay rates to the local council and so also bring a positive benefit to your community.
Businesses themselves have a role to play in this, and you can hold them accountable on it. If you are choosing between two local cafes to get that takeaway coffee from, consider asking where their suppliers are based. Do they have their own shop local policy in place — do they purchase their ingredients locally?
When you are in the supermarket, look at the labels carefully. Are your items from a Taranaki supplier or have they been trucked across the country? Who are you supporting when you spend your dollars?
Not all businesses have a bricks and mortar presence so please include local farmers markets, honesty boxes and farm gate stalls when you are stocking up on fresh produce.
Give your business to those who support other local businesses and together we can build our economy back up.

National cabinet a basis for rebooting federation	The Australian	Leaders engaging directly, without bureaucrats, works well
When the nation emerges from the Great Lockdown, federal and state leaders will need the most efficient decision-making processes possible to lead the nation out of the worst recession since the Great Depression.
All sides of politics at state and federal level agree on a key point — the national cabinet has worked well during the coronavirus crisis. On Tuesday, Scott Morrison told The Australian his preference was for the model to become a permanent decision-making body to manage the federation, replacing the Council of Australian Governments. State leaders, Coalition and Labor, have acknowledged the Prime Minister’s idea has merit, with NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, West Australian Premier Mark McGowan and Queensland’s Annastacia Palaszczuk announcing they are open to it.
The Prime Minister was correct when he said the national cabinet — formed in response to the pandemic — had made the federation “more responsive and more co-ordinated than we’ve seen in many years”. Within that body, leaders have consulted frankly and made timely, cohesive decisions while leaving room for states to fill in particulars to meet their local needs and conditions.
COAG, which normally meets twice a year and occasionally four times a year, is heavily driven by bureaucracies and process. For more than a decade, its participants have failed to expedite reforms in key spheres, such as economic management, healthcare, energy policy, eliminating duplication, and cutting red and green tape to streamline development approvals. That reform holiday will need to stop if the economy is to gear up to grow its way out of the mire of debt run up in responding to COVID-19.
The dynamic between federal, state and territory leaders could fall back to business as usual, of course, once the health crisis has passed and political considerations, upcoming elections and fractious MPs reassert their influences. Experience during the past month, however, since the national cabinet was established at COAG on March 13, does show that elected leaders of different political persuasions, at different levels of government, can cut through obstacles to achieve results when minded to do so in the public interest. Any ding-dong barneys have been kept between themselves.
This top-down model, as opposed to laboriously worded agreements drafted by bureaucrats, also should be made to work during the recovery phase from the pandemic, especially when it comes to matters such as turning off the tap of government largesse. Policymaking and decisions will become increasingly complex and challenging as leaders consider how best to maximise productivity across the economy to generate wealth and revenue to repay government debts.
Regardless of how long the national cabinet model remains in place, its best characteristics — direct and more frequent communication between leaders without packing up their entourages and flying interstate, flexibility and a focus on national priorities — must be entrenched in the conduct of federal-state relations. Since its establishment, the national cabinet has met 12 times and will hold its next meeting on Thursday. As in past federal-state relationships, much will depend on leaders’ commitments to reform and on personalities.
In the past, reform-minded leaders have taken charge of what has often been an underperforming federation and used carrots and sticks to implement reform. Paul Keating used the COAG framework to implement the Hilmer competition review’s measures, leading to better performance in gas, electricity, water and road transport. The success of that endeavour was boosted by the reformist approach of Jeff Kennett as Victorian premier from 1992 to 1999.
Post-pandemic, Mr Morrison, Josh Frydenberg and their state and territory counterparts will have no choice but to be bold and reformist in encouraging economic growth and pruning government spending.
On Tuesday, QBE chief executive Pat Regan warned of “a deep and extended recession” because of COVID-19. Even before the pandemic, growth had slowed. Federal-state co-operation would enhance the process of steering the economy back to health, especially if state leaders proved visionary enough to reform imposts such as payroll tax that act as a brake on businesses and employment. Such reform also would require encouragement at federal level.In four weeks the Morrison government, the premiers and the chief ministers have achieved much through collaborating on economic measures, social policy, education, health and aged care. The impetus for pragmatic co-operation has come from public expectations that governments would rise to the challenge posed by an unprecedented health and economic crisis. Nothing less will be needed in the recovery phase.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Nation well placed to grasp opportunities of a new year	The Australian	Leaders have done well in the pandemic but must manage recovery
Caution because of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in subdued celebrations to usher in the new year, but Australians have good reasons to feel positive about what 2021 may bring. A year that started with the ravages of bushfires has ended with farmers celebrating high yields and a return of soaking rains. The past year brought testing times for the world but Australia weathered the storm well. As a result, as Scott Morrison says in his New Year’s message, we enter 2021 “stronger, safer” and “together” after finding the “grit and ingenuity” to confront the pandemic, the country’s “greatest challenge since World War II”. Like generations before us, the Prime Minister says, we have found “that same indomitable Australian spirit”. Throughout the year Australia has enhanced its reputation for being an independently minded but dependable partner in global affairs. The nation is well placed, therefore, to engage in the repositioning of international affairs now occurring that will help to define the coming year and decade.
Notable among the shifts already under way is the election of a new president in the US, a successful conclusion to Brexit negotiations between Britain and the EU, and new co-operation being forged among like-minded nations to resist the excesses of communist China under Xi Jinping. Australia can expect to work well with Joe Biden’s administration, with shared security interests cementing the bond. Unshackled from the EU, Britain presents a fresh opportunity to expand trade with a country with which Australia shares so much history. Closer to home, trade challenges with China must be addressed, but there are positive signs of strengthening relationships with Japan, India and our Asian neighbours.
Combating the pandemic has come at a heavy cost for governments everywhere, but Australians can feel confident our government has performed better than most. After a rollercoaster ride, Australia’s sharemarket finished the year close to where it started after dipping 43 per cent from its peak when the pandemic first struck. Counter to doomsday predictions of a major correction in house prices, domestic real estate has fared better than many expected, boosting confidence and helping guard against a second-wave economic hit. Coming weeks will show how durable the recovery from COVID-imposed restrictions will be as government support is wound back and lenders assess non-performing loans.
In his message, Mr Morrison announced a small but meaningful change to our national anthem. The words “young and free” will be replaced with “one and free”, a change proposed by NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian in November. Mr Morrison is correct when he says Australia, as a modern nation, may be relatively young but our country’s story is ancient — Indigenous Australians have been on our continent for 60,000 years. The change also reflects what we have lived as a nation, especially during the past year, as Mr Morrison says. While the change makes sense, it is unfortunate that various states are again undermining national unity and cohesion by reimposing hard border lockdowns in response to new and relatively small coronavirus clusters. After reporting 18 new COVID cases on Wednesday, NSW contained the increase to 10 on Thursday. On the strength of the rising caseload, Victoria has closed its border to NSW, inconveniencing travellers far removed from hotspots. Western Australia has taken the absurd step of shutting out Victorians, whose state recorded three new cases in the past 24 hours. Regardless of new year spirit, political expediency rules weeks from the WA election in March.
States adopting the hardline approaches of Daniel Andrews and Mark McGowan against COVID-19 would be well advised to learn the lessons of history. Henry Ergas, in his first column for 2021 on Friday, notes that after the devastating plague that ravaged 14th-century Italian city-states, it was the most autocratic rulers who responded most brutally, and seemingly most effectively, by implementing draconian policies of mandatory isolation, closing public places and prohibiting foreigners from entering. Across the longer term, however, it was not the autocracies that flourished but the more liberal republics that were better able to improvise and adapt. A similar pattern emerged in the 1820s when a series of cholera pandemics struck Europe. While autocratic Prussia led the way in hard borders and crowd control, it was Britain’s less drastic and intrusive measures that fostered innovative solutions and proved more effective in the long run.
Internationally, with vaccination programs under way in the world’s major hotspots, including the US and Europe, the potential exists for the pandemic to be brought quickly into check. The federal government has set a timeline for a domestic vaccine program that starts in March and that should have everybody who wants it covered by October. Given the continued spread of infections, the government could work hard to begin vaccinations for frontline workers and the elderly as soon as regulatory approvals are given and supplies are available. Successful vaccination programs also bring the prospect of global travel restrictions being lifted and the world economy springing back to life.
Much has changed as a result of the pandemic, with some changes likely to endure. A greater acceptance of working from home has provided many with a better sense of work-life balance. Caring for neighbours and loved ones has been a priority, along with an appreciation of the need for better aged care. Governments put political enmities aside to co-operate with the national cabinet process. As venture capitalist Paul Bassat told Damon Kitney on Thursday, Australia must be brave in seizing the opportunities presented by COVID. Mr Bassat says the pandemic demonstrated there is a greater preparedness in the community to accept change, which in turn has given politicians a new level of authority. If seized quickly and used well, this movement in community sentiment provides a big opportunity. But it will be easily squandered if politicians fail to manage the transition effectively. The new year is sure to bring change. Away from the haze of pandemic, Australia is well placed to seize the opportunities that will arise.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
A government not to be trusted	The Australian	Lebanon’s big problem is the malign influence of Hezbollah In view of the appalling mess in Lebanon, the Morrison government’s $2m in emergency aid following last week’s devastating explosion has been sent not to the government in Beirut but to our “trusted aid partners, the World Food Program and Red Cross’’, to ensure food and medical care are provided to those in need. It was a good call by Foreign Minister Marise Payne.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who headed to Beirut after the blast, also announced that aid from Lebanon’s former colonial power “would not be channelled through the Lebanese political system”. Other nations have followed suit. Nothing better underlines the extent of international contempt for the corruption that has thrived for decades at the heart of a government that depends on the support of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist army. It is little wonder tens of thousands of citizens took to the streets of Beirut at the weekend to protest the official corruption they believe led to the detonation of 2750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate at the city’s port. Hezbollah controls the port and airport, as David Kilcullen wrote on Saturday. Its influence over the government may have prevented UN maritime forces from intervening over the unsafe storage of the chemical compound. A government with nothing to hide would want to get to the bottom of what happened. But when President Michel Aoun, a veteran of Lebanese politics, was asked whether an international inquiry should be set up, he dismissed the idea. Given Hezbollah’s influence, it is hard to believe it was unaware of the stockpile. Hezbollah, with Iran pulling the strings, is largely responsible for the nation’s economic collapse. Ranked 137th on Transparency International’s corruption index, Lebanon, which occupies a highly strategic position, needs stability and clean government. It will not have either until it stops Hezbollah’s malign interference.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
A fighting strategy for jobs growth in a tough arena	The Australian	Lending and insolvency reforms will help economic activity The Morrison government will step up to confront a new economic arena on budget day, October 6 — one shaped by the fallout of the coronavirus. Rather than relying on simplistic Band-Aid measures that eventually may or may not produce a slow, painful recovery, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have opted for “striving valiantly”, to paraphrase Theodore Roosevelt in 1910. They are opening up the arena, backing businesses, families and individuals who are prepared to invest and spend, to “have a go to get a go’’. As Simon Benson reports, responsible lending laws imposed during the global financial crisis will be jettisoned to inject an “adrenaline shot” into the economy by lifting onerous barriers for home buyers and small businesses.
The economic arena will not be a place for the faint-hearted. Nor will it be risk-free. That is not the nature of enterprising societies, which the important supply-side reforms will encourage. Scrapping most responsible lending obligations and throwing viable small businesses a lifeline to trade their way out of insolvency are designed to speed and strengthen activity. In tandem with the Treasurer’s willingness to put effective stimulus ahead of budget repair for now, they amount to a bold plan. As Mr Frydenberg told the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Thursday, “only through repairing the economy can we repair the budget”.
“Cold and timid souls”, to borrow another Roosevelt phrase, might decry the scrapping of RLOs. These were legislated in 2009 to prevent “unsuitable” credit lending by banks, credit unions and other financiers. But a decade of “regulatory creep” and hundreds of pages of guidelines have seen the pendulum swing too far from borrower beware to lender beware, as Mr Frydenberg writes on Friday. With interest rates at historic lows and likely to fall further, and plenty of liquidity available, onerous red tape blocking the provision of credit to productive businesses and households wanting to invest and spend is a brake on jobs.
Balance is important. So, as always, is responsibility on the part of borrowers and banks. As Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe told the House of Representatives economics committee last month, the principles in the original RLO legislation were sound. “But the way we’ve translated those principles into reality, I think, needs looking at again.” Those principles, Dr Lowe said, “have turned into hundreds of pages of guidance”.
The move to throw struggling businesses a lifeline to trade their way out of insolvency is timely given the vast number of businesses facing imminent closure and job losses in the wake of lockdowns and closed borders. As Benson reported on Thursday, that initiative owes much to US-style Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws that will help such businesses avoid being wound up by “vulture” ­administrators. The reform will apply to small and family-run firms as well as to sole traders owing less than $1m to creditors. About 98 per cent of those affected employ 20 staff or fewer. From a taxpayer’s perspective, the reform will be revenue neutral.
Like most once-in-a-generation reforms, the plan has potential for unintended consequences. Regardless of trading conditions, dud businesses invariably fail, sooner or later. While some may seek or gain a temporary reprieve under this change, it is not about propping them up indefinitely. The plan mitigates the risk to creditors and to third parties investing in failing businesses. Businesses on the brink of insolvency would be given 20 days to devise a plan to trade their way out and to offer a deal to creditors. The creditors would then have 15 days to vote on accepting such a deal. As in all financial dealings, the “caveat emptor” principle remains applicable. But removing costly administrators and lawyers’ picnics from a fraught process will leave struggling businesses, their staff and creditors better off. As Robert Gottliebsen noted, the once-in-30-years change recognises that the nature of many of the jobs in our society is changing and that those who take a risk and generate work should not be bankrupted at their first failure.
It is a measure of Australia’s current economic reality that the Liberal Party had cast off its previous objectives of budget surpluses and debt repayment. Budget repair, while vital, has been postponed until unemployment is “comfortably” below 6 per cent. This is sensible. But the government is right to stick to its strategy of capping taxes as a percentage of GDP to under 23.9 per cent. But this will be 23.9 per cent of a much smaller GDP cake as a result of our worst recession since the 1930s. The economy also will lose a significant tailwind, with net overseas migration expected to be negative this and next financial year. In confronting such circumstances, the government is prepared to provide temporary and targeted support. But as Mr Frydenberg says, while the government is prepared for years of climbing debt and large deficits, its fiscal strategy is “consistent with our core values”. Its focus, appropriately, will be on infrastructure spending, accelerating legislated income tax cuts and enacting reforms to encourage business investment, borrowing and activity. In an economic arena unlike any seen for 90 years, the endgame must be to boost economic confidence, which is the path to private sector job creation. The merits of the strategy can be assessed fully only after the budget. Its broad parameters, however, are sound. They are not about simplistic “big government” that would produce a faux recovery but combine supply-side reforms and targeted spending to help business activity and job creation.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Nations must back virus probe	The Australian	Lessons from COVID-19 will help avoid another pandemic As China is lobbying hard against it, there is no certainty the 62-nation coalition that has come together to back Scott Morrison’s call for an inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic will get the support it needs at the virtual meeting of the World Health Organisation’s “parliament”, the 194-nation World Health Assembly, on Tuesday. Given the remarkable breadth of the coalition, with even Russia — where the caseload is rising fast — backing a motion to effect an inquiry, Beijing would be making a bad mistake if it failed to recognise the depth of feeling across the world about how the pandemic emerged in Wuhan and how it was mishandled by the WHO.
The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, from Spain, who has played a crucial role in mobilising support for Mr Morrison’s call, is correct when he says the assembly should not be “a time for blame games and mutual reproach … it is not the moment to reproach anybody but instead to join forces against a problem that is everyone’s. If we don’t solve it everywhere, we won’t solve it anywhere”. All 27 EU nations, as well as countries as disparate as the UK, Japan, India, Indonesia, South Africa, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico and Turkey, in addition to Russia, have all been profoundly affected by COVID-19. And in backing the motion, all are determined to seek and find answers to a crisis that by Sunday involved more than 4.6 million cases of the virus and 312,000 deaths. Economies around the globe have been shattered.
Beijing may be in its usual state of frenetic high dudgeon about the prospect of an unwanted inquiry. But, as Mr Borrell said, China should also have a vital interest in learning more about the origin of this disease to prevent the next pandemic, because it is not going to be the last.
The lengthy motion drawn up by the EU, in consultation with Australia, demands the WHO’s director-general, Ethiopian Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, a shameless Beijing toady, “initiate at the earliest appropriate moment … a stepwise process of impartial and comprehensive evaluation” of the international response to the pandemic, and the actions of the WHO and its “timeline” in dealing with it.
There is nothing remarkable about that, as the Prime Minister reiterated on Friday. The motion, he said, is “not directed at anyone … all we want to know is what happened so it doesn’t happen again. It’s a pretty honest question with an honest intent and an honest motive.” The motion does not refer specifically to the origins of COVID-19. But as Ben Packham reports on Monday, that is implicit. The reference to the WHO’s role in dealing with the crisis could go some way towards addressing criticism of the world body’s slowness in responding to the crisis, and its fawning praise for China, despite the CCP’s brutal silencing of Chinese medical whistleblowers. There are important precedents for such an inquiry. In 2014, the WHO commissioned inquiries into the Ebola crisis in West Africa. In 2010, a review committee was convened to evaluate the response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic “and assess the level of global preparedness for similar events in the future”. That inquiry presciently concluded “the world is ill-prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic or to any similarly global and threatening public health emergency”. The COVID-19 crisis shows such apprehension was valid. All members of the World Health Assembly need to recognise that the virus is its most serious challenge since it was founded in 1948.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Sheepish virtue signal exposed	The Australian	Let she who is without fault on emissions post the first tweet
At the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu last August, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s unctuous critique of the Morrison government’s energy policies elevated her to green sainthood among climate activists on this side of the ditch. “The world needs more leaders like Jacinda Ardern — who clearly understand the scale of the Climate Emergency ahead of us. She embarrassed Morrison before talks had even begun at the Pacific Islands Forum — and history will remember her as a strong and compassionate leader,” Greens leader Richard Di Natale gushed on Twitter. In an outbreak of Kiwi envy, others later piled in, lauding Ms Ardern as “my hero” and “a global icon”, and wishing “we had a PM like @jacindaardern”. On New Year’s Day, barrister Julian Burnside tweeted about New Zealand, “where they HAVE a real leader”.
Last August, Ms Ardern said Australia had “to ­answer to the Pacific” for its position on ­climate change. She did not mention, conveniently, that New Zealand is forecast to fail to meet its Paris target to ­reduce emissions by 30 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030. Australia is working towards meeting our target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, with or without Kyoto carry-over credits. New Zealand Climate Change Minister James Shaw is opposed to countries using Kyoto credits to meet Paris targets. Last week he claimed there was an “allergic reaction” around the world to nations doing so. Be that as it may, or not, the inconvenient truth is New Zealand used carry-over credits from its 2012 target to meet its 2020 target. Australia, in contrast, is forecast to clear our 2020 target by 287 million tonnes without the carry-over mechanism. The use of carry-over credits is not for neighbourhood busybodies to meddle in but for individual nations’ elected representatives to decide, based on their own national interests.
In Tuvalu, Ms Ardern wanted Scott Morrison to back a UN push for a carbon-­neutral economy by 2050, declaring every ­nation had to “do its bit” to fight global warming. New Zealand has excluded agriculture and methane from its carbon-neutral pledge. That is especially convenient because agricultural products and meat are New Zealand’s major exports, accounting for 40 per cent of revenue.
It was left to New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters to inject a dose of realism into the discussion in Tuvalu. Demands for Australia to abandon coal, Mr Peters said, were a “bit of a paradox” from Pacific nations seeking cheap loans from China “on the back of coal-fired everything”. Mr Peters said he was concerned about perceptions that Mr Morrison was “somehow acting incorrectly” when that was not the “real picture at all”. At the forum, Australia’s International Development and the Pacific Minister Alex Hawke produced a table showing Australia had 20 of the world’s 2459 operating coalmines, of which 126 were in China and 33 in India. Of 359 coalmines in pre-construction, Australia, with better quality and cleaner coal than most, had two new mines under way.Statistics aside, it is up to nations to decide how to set and meet their own targets. Aside from the hypocrisy inherent in Ms Arden goading Mr Morrison about Australia’s policies, the facts are a reality check for the New Zealand leader’s groupies over here.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Rings of containment on a bumpy economic recovery	The Australian	Let’s be positive and build on the great progress we’ve made “We’re all Melburnians now,” Scott Morrison said on Wednesday, a nod to JFK, as three rings of containment looped the southern capital. Given the NSW-Victorian border had only closed at midnight, a touch of Melbourne elan slipped into Sydney. Collingwood’s Magpies trained at a chilly Henson Park, home to the Newtown Jets rugby league club, while Hawthorn’s stars had earlier frolicked in the surf at Coogee. The ripples from Victoria’s lockdown will become a second wave of economic pain, reaching far beyond our second most populous state. Victoria accounts for one quarter of national output; its ache will be everyone else’s as supply chains are disrupted, more jobs are lost, growth is curtailed and a sense of dread seeps back in among employers and, workers. Stop-go-stop-go is a destroyer.
So Canberra is coming to the rescue while Victoria gets its outbreak under control. Taxpayers will be on the hook to support demand. As Josh Frydenberg told Adam Creighton at an exclusive Q&A for this newspaper on Tuesday night, the new lockdown is set to cost the economy $6bn in the coming six weeks. The Morrison government will address that substantial slug in the next phase of income support, after the late September expiry of JobKeeper and JobKeeper supplement. Details will come in its mini-budget on July 23. A wage subsidy of $1100 a fortnight has been flagged. While the Treasurer has said payments will be targeted and temporary, the overall cost will be higher than thought only a week ago because of Victoria’s infections spike.
As Mr Frydenberg said at our event, consumer and business confidence had improved with manufacturing activity getting back to where it was before the pandemic. Mobility around cities was up and generating retail spending. The shutdown will stifle recovery, so the Treasurer has opened the door to fast-tracking personal income tax cuts. “We do want to boost aggregate demand, boost consumption, put more money in people’s pockets, and that’s one way to do it,” he said. The tax cuts, due in July 2022, would lift the 19 per cent rate’s application from $41,000 to $45,000 and the 32.5 per cent rate from $90,000 to $120,000. In a crisis era of “whatever it takes”, however, those cuts are priced at a modest $8.7bn in the first year.
It’s clear industries are running at different speeds, with most businesses rejigging operations to reduce the cost of labour, rents, travel and equipment. The latter is a bad omen, as business investment has long been weak and a key reason behind our productivity slump. Changes to the instant asset write-off have had a stimulatory effect, particularly on vehicle sales. But more tax breaks for business are needed. The Treasurer was preparing to introduce an investment allowance, first proposed by Labor and pushed by business, in his second budget, which has been pushed back from May to October. It would be odd if this element were missing from the economic statement in a fortnight.
We knew there would be outbreaks, but the sudden jump in Victorian cases has shaken confidence in the ability of Premier Daniel Andrews to manage it. Yet the Prime Minister has stressed for months we have the medical facilities, testing capacity and tracing expertise to meet the challenges. This underpins our ability to get people back to work, school and social events, and build momentum for the post-pandemic world, albeit without a vaccine. As Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said after holding the line on a 0.25 per cent cash rate, recovery will be bumpy and will depend on containing the virus. As Mr Morrison explained, Victoria’s success is the nation’s success.
Dr Lowe’s advice is that the nature and speed of recovery remains “highly uncertain”. He’s an unreconstructed optimist. So the stakes have been raised again for economic reform, to empower the private sector to expand, invest, innovate and hire people. Canberra has to get the fiscal basics right, which it has, Treasury’s spectacular forecasting error aside. But the harder task is to fashion a more dynamic economy to raise productivity, profits and wages. The Morrison government must work with the states and others to get better incentives, prices and processes for infrastructure, skills, workplace rules and innovation. Can the Prime Minister and Treasurer break a two-decade complacency on supply-side reform? Will Anthony Albanese and Labor, and a motley bunch of premiers and chief ministers, hinder or help them in a spirit of national revival? The infections setback aside, a more positive national polity is possible. Witness the problem-solving, nimble forum of the national cabinet. Or the tax reform proposals coming out of NSW. There are five working groups on industrial relations, convened by the federal government, with employers and unions seeking more flexible workplaces, simpler awards and better wage setting. A bold new compact on skills may emerge via the revamped federalism framework. There is more going on to lift productivity, for sure, but it’s predicated on trust, political will, energy, imagination and resilience. It’s also largely dependent on keeping Australia open and safe, however we can, using the tools and knowledge we’ve accumulated, and building on the significant progress we’ve made.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
EDITORIAL We should toast our financial success	Hawkes Bay Today	Let’s pause to recognise how spectacular the latest unemployment figure of 4.9 per cent is.
Economists were gob-smacked, staggered, flabbergasted, and astonished — you could take your pick of adjectives on Wednesday.
Not even the most wildly optimistic forecasters imagined our economy would remain so robust with the borders closed.
The incredible run of economic data across the past few months has largely ended the debate about the relative merits of New Zealand’s Covid-19 elimination strategy. It worked.
We spent less time locked down than nations that dithered. Our economy has performed better.
Our Government got it right. Support packages like the wage subsidy have worked as hoped.
Despite the dire predictions of National leader Judith Collins, there was no “tsunami” of job losses when the scheme ended.
Business and workers used the time to adapt to the new economic conditions. Treasury’s accounts are in better shape than expected and the nation will need to borrow less.
Finance Minister Grant Robertson deserves more than a pat on the back but, right now, we can’t afford to pause for long.
First and most obviously, the immediate challenges of the pandemic remain alive. There is still time for a Covid-19 outbreak to undo all our good work.
New Zealand’s success in dealing with the pandemic and our relatively strong economic position puts us at the forefront of the “normalisation challenge” facing the world’s policy-makers. How long can the tap of government fiscal support and central bank money-printing stay on?
How long can interest rates stay at record lows before economies start to overheat? The official answer is probably: for some time yet. So far central banks and most governments have indicated an intention to lean heavily towards supporting their economies until they are certain recession risks have faded. But financial markets always look forward.
In New Zealand, thanks to the absence of the virus, we are already ahead of that curve. Investors are now revising the time frames for Reserve Bank interest rate moves. They are forecast to come sooner rather than later. Talk of negative interest rates is off the table. Mortgage rates could rise from record lows as expectations are priced in.
With the housing market and sharemarket running perilously hot, there is global concern about what happens when interest rates rise.
Fund managers are already poised to pull back to defensive investment positions. That’s not so easy for those who may have over-extended with million-dollar mortgages. We need to stay alert to a whole new set of economic risks. So let’s celebrate success but not fall victim of it.—NZ Herald	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Culture and domestic violence	The Australian	Let’s think harder about how to encourage safer families
The scourge of domestic violence has come out of the shadows of Australian society in recent years, and for the better. The campaigns to reduce its incidence have a resonance and authority that other efforts to achieve social change can learn a lot from. But the reluctance of some involved in working to stop domestic violence to look beyond one-size-fits-all solutions is self-defeating. A case in point is the lack of plain thinking around how to confront the disproportionate incidence of domestic violence among indigenous communities. Nicola Berkovic reported in The Australian this week that, across the 10 years to 2015-16, 23 per cent of intimate partner homicide victims were indigenous. The Australian Institute of Criminology data also revealed that another 22 per cent of these victims came from an overseas-born background. Obviously, such outcomes indicate strongly where the investment in preventing domestic violence should be directed.
However, as Jacinta Nampijinpa Price pointed out in The Australian’s commentary pages on Wednesday, there is a prevailing view among organisations campaigning against domestic violence that suggests indigenous men who hurt their partners and family members should not be held wholly to blame for their actions. This despite the fact indigenous women are likelier to be the targets of violence, tend to suffer more severe abuse than non-indigenous women and find it harder to overcome community resistance to addressing the violence they are subjected to. Why should colonisation and not the cultural drivers in indigenous communities themselves be the reason for this?
Ms Price, a Warlpiri-Celtic woman from Alice Springs, knows something about domestic violence. “As a girl growing up I saw other girls my age reach adolescence and then be married off to much older men while still too young to be legally married under Australian law,” Ms Price said. “I witnessed women being brutally beaten by their husbands, but the cultural acceptance of it was so strong no one besides my immediate family supported the victim or reported the abuse.” It is difficult to see how the historical impacts of colonisation were working to create such circumstances.
The Institute of Criminology figures also suggest that a disproportionate number of women from a migrant background are subjected to domestic violence. That should encourage more questions over whether issues of culture can explain such an outcome. Instead, asking such questions is condemned immediately as pushing an agenda that somehow denies violence against women is an issue that all cultures should address.Reflecting on the high incidence of partner homicides among indigenous and overseas-born Australians is not a means to excuse domestic violence occurring in any other part of Australian society. Family violence is a national disgrace that the nation as a whole must own and work to reduce. But that makes it doubly important that the programs and funding aimed at stopping domestic violence, no matter where it occurs, are as effective as possible. Ms Price points out that official audits of some programs have found there has been scant attention paid to what works to reduce domestic violence and what does not. Surely proper evaluation will encourage safer families.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Andrews pumps up gas supply	The Australian	Lifting exploration and production bans will boost jobs
Better late than never, Premier Daniel Andrews has lifted Victoria’s ban on onshore conventional gas exploration and development from July next year. The move is essential if increased supplies are to offset looming shortages as the once prolific offshore Bass Strait fields dry up. In a foolish concession to green groups, Mr Andrews has also made Victoria’s temporary ban on fracking and coal-seam gas exploration permanent.
Allowing conventional gas development will boost the Victorian economy and heavy industries, which have complained that the ban has driven up prices, making it harder to compete with interstate and international rivals. The move should also help stave off future energy shortages. The Australian Energy Market Operator has forecast shortfalls in Victorian gas supply as early as 2024 if resources are not developed. And the shortages could happen earlier if winter demand is high. As Perry Williams wrote on Tuesday, energy advisory firm EnergyQuest has warned that NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania will face gas shortfalls as soon as 2022.
In anticipation of the moratorium being lifted — it was due to expire on June 30 this year — companies such as Lakes Oil have plans for drilling in place. Potentially significant onshore gas resources could be extracted from the state’s Otway Basin, which stretches into South Australia, where an industry is up and running.
Like competition watchdog Rod Sims, The Australian has consistently called on Victoria to lift the moratorium and for other states, especially NSW, to free up their supplies. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission called for the lifting of east coast gas bans as long ago as April 2016. In August last year, Mr Sims pointed out: “If we really want permanently lower prices in the south we need more gas in the south.’’ Supply must also be increased because gas is a key transition fuel for the nation as it moves to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Last month, in its eighth annual gas inquiry report, the ACCC warned that high gas prices were forcing factories to shut and companies to go into liquidation. The report said concerns about future gas supply were “exacerbated by the blanket moratoria and regulatory restrictions in some states and territories, which inhibit further gas exploration and development of new gas resources, ­especially in Victoria and NSW”.
While NSW permits conventional and unconventional exploration, the Berejiklian government, in an effort to appease environmentalists, has boasted it has the “toughest” regulations in Australia, particularly in relation to the fracking of coal-seam gas. In January, the Morrison and Berejiklian governments announced a $2bn agreement to strengthen NSW’s electricity grid. As part of the package, NSW agreed to bring more gas into the market. In the wake of the Victorian decision, Premier Gladys Berejiklian needs to turn her attention to clearing the way for Santos’s Narrabri project, which has the potential to fill half of NSW’s domestic supply.
NSW, unfortunately, has delayed approvals for almost a decade. Such red tape and indecision, on a par with Queensland’s dithering over the Adani coal project, is unacceptable.
The Andrews government estimates output from state gas resources could generate $310m a year for regional economies and create 6400 jobs over the lifespan of projects. That is good news for Victorians as the economy begins taking a battering from COVID-19. It also begs the question of why the state has wasted so much time.The moratorium on conventional onshore gas exploration dates back to May 2014, when the former Napthine government suspended decisions on all onshore gas exploration in the state until after the state election in November that year, which Labor won. Rather than lifting the suspension post-election, the Andrews government consolidated it with the moratorium. The policy has been a costly failure. But following pressure from unions, industry and consumers, the reversal was essential.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Feeding the chooks while Australians feel the pain	The Australian	Lifting the 8pm-to-5am curfew would be a sensible first step With federal parliament sitting, the political gloves are off regarding Victoria’s mismanagement of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Anthony Albanese is running political interference on aged care but, by overshooting with moves to extend his emergency powers, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has opened the floodgates of discontent. Rather than dig in, Mr Andrews must take stock and call for help. Scott Morrison must be magnanimous in providing assistance to Victoria out of compassion for fellow Australians and in a spirit of national duty. Proper account must be taken immediately of whether existing measures to lock down Victorians are doing more harm than good. Warnings from health professionals that draconian measures are incubating a mental health catastrophe must be heeded. The risk is very real that the mental and financial impact of Victoria’s second-wave lockdown may lead desperate people to self-harm.
There is a lesson for everyone in Mr Andrews’s miscalculations and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s politically motivated border controls. As Paul Kelly warned on Wednesday, closed borders, harsh lockdowns and parochial behaviour by premiers resurrect the discredited reactionary culture of Fortress Australia, where state protectionism was the route to political success.
Unless this is curbed, such sentiment flowing into post-pandemic political culture will leave Australia diminished. The federal opposition is right to apply scrutiny to the government over aged care but must be careful not to succumb to opportunism in parliament. Clearly, the federal government must do better on aged care but it has been able to demonstrate that despite some horrific outbreaks in some homes, the sector overall has to date remained free from COVID-19 contagion. Mr Morrison drew on his experience of having lost a parent in aged care this year to highlight an uncomfortable truth that few have been prepared to acknowledge. That is, people often go into aged-care homes for pre-palliative care and will not be returning home. The aged-care issue, ultimately, is unlikely to be one that affords the opposition long-term relevance in the context of the pandemic.
In contrast, without corrective action, the mess being created by Labor in Victoria threatens to be a liability for the nation for generations. Critics are emerging across ideological lines to question whether Mr Andrews has lost his way. The Australian Medical Association has listed the failings of his government’s COVID response. These include allowing Black Lives Matter protests and mismanaging the hotel quarantine system. At the core, the AMA says, has been a lack of transparency and accountability. Information on the pandemic must be shared more widely and must be better understood. This mirrors our observation on Wednesday that in his desire to extend restrictions on Victorians’ liberties, Mr Andrews has revealed a disturbing thirst for extra power and diminished accountability. Rather than enunciating a path forward, he offers a daily pantomime of openness that resembles Joh Bjelke-Petersen’s technique as Queensland premier of “feeding the chooks”.
The cracks are beyond question. Mr Andrews needs help and perspective to navigate his way out of a pandemic crisis and a looming social emergency. The increasing politicisation of the issue in Canberra and within state jurisdictions is not helpful. Mr Morrison must find a way of breaking through the short-term political palaver playing out in the states. This is difficult. But Australians are suffering. Mr Andrews must find a way of breaking free from the leadership routine he has fostered. A first step is to end the curfew in metropolitan Melbourne that has law-abiding citizens restricted to home from 8pm to 5am. Lifting it would ease the torment. Mr Andrews’s government must then be more open, with a clear message on how and when remaining restrictions will be lifted. He needs to be clear with the public about the markers that will return life to normality. Now, more than at any time in our history, state leaders need a plan that is more than delegating leadership to the bureaucracy.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
EDITORIAL	Bay of Plenty Times	Like a spring tide, it appears to me there’s a shift in the flow of people on our coast.
This week the motorways are no doubt getting busier again in Auckland as our visitors and bach owners return to the city, but an extra day off work for Auckland Anniversary weekend will change that again and bring many back to the Coromandel.
Over the years I’ve had city dwellers quiz me about living permanently at the beach.
Some will say “I’d miss having things to do”, “I’m just not ready”, “I’d get bored”, and the latter is a statement I just don’t understand.
We don’t have malls, sure, but there’s always something to do here — usually amongst nature — and still plenty I haven’t got to explore and enjoy after 20 years.
This weekend is packed with music, art, heritage and culture events in our towns and neighbouring settlements, from gold panning and aviation heritage in Thames to art in Kuaotunu, international rock legends in Whitianga, 50s dancing at the Tairua Heritage Fete and bargain books at the Lions Craft Market.
Enjoy your Anniversary Weekend everyone. — Alison Smith	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Honesty on virus progress and strategy will win trust	The Australian	Lockdown 3.0 is stress-testing Victorian Premier’s integrity In the second week of March Scott Morrison addressed the nation on the first hit of fiscal stimulus — what now seems a puny $17.6bn — and the health plan to deal with the pandemic. At the time we urged the Prime Minister to level with the public about the life in shutdown to come, to allow people to prepare physically and mentally for the days, weeks and months ahead. What was the modelling telling officials about how many people would be infected or die? What would happen to schools, workplaces and sporting events? All the talk was about “flattening the curve” of COVID-19 cases to buy time for our health systems to prepare and allow hospitals to cope. We understood that officials were flying blind in a fog with an enemy on their tail. Still, we argued we needed the real story: “Australians, quiet and strong, can handle the truth.” The defensive mindset within our governments is again clogging the flow of information and is undermining trust and compliance with restrictions. The Victorian government has pulled hard on the emergency brake, declaring a state of disaster for six weeks and putting in place stage four restrictions, including a curfew from 8pm to 5am in metropolitan Melbourne and strict limits on mobility. The state’s Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, said the measures were a form of “shock and awe” to jolt fatigued citizens out of complacency. Was this the only way to get people to take notice? What is the government trying to achieve here? On Sunday, Professor Sutton said the six-week lockdown 2.0, almost two-thirds completed, had suppressed community transmission and “maybe” the state had passed the peak of infections. Victoria’s moving daily average of new cases had settled at around 500, so why escalate to lockdown 3.0? Is the testing too slow or the tracing busting at the seams?
If there is modelling or medical advice about an increase in community transmission, then why not share that with people? Was this simply a political decision? Or was it a fresh act in crisis theatre by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to reassert tight control and salvage prestige? We are desperately short on answers and free to speculate. Is Victoria’s extreme lockdown strategy aimed at limiting the number of deaths, which are mostly in aged-care homes, suppressing community transmission more generally or a forlorn attempt at eliminating the virus? How long will it take to reach the goal? What would stage five restrictions look like? So many questions, so few answers. Without the truth, citizens are left to catastrophise, aided by politicians with pumped-up metaphors, while TV reporters fan fears out of all proportion.
The idea we are in a war, propagated by numerous politicians, is counter-productive. It feeds a community siege mentality, leads to policy panic and even to a situation where legitimate questioning of decisions and alternative policy approaches draw a backlash. Commentators who raise the idea of cost-benefit analysis in calibrating the responses are portrayed as heartless, indifferent to the most vulnerable in our midst, or oddly obsessed about the economy. To these trolls, often ensconced in the public sector, it’s as if jobs, sales, taxes and profits are abstract concepts and not the human-based vectors of how we have arranged the mutually beneficial exchanges in our society. To veer close to Julia Gillard’s clumsy construction at the 2011 ALP conference, the economy is us. Closing down commerce, as Mr Andrews has done, has real-life consequences for employers, workers, consumers and partners along vast supply chains. On Monday the Premier announced three new categories for business operations. Another 250,000 Victorians are likely to be stood down. To win public consent, attain social compliance and achieve the hoped-for results, our leaders need to be straight, thorough and consistent in their dealings and communications. Trust is a two-way street. To get buy-in from Victorians for such drastic action, Mr Andrews must take responsibility for action and inaction; he must concede critical mistakes were made on his watch and promise poor testing and tracing systems are being improved. The Premier also must fully explain what he hopes to achieve and supply the evidence behind decisions. This will carry an educative function across the nation. Mr Andrews is asking a lot from Victorians so he has a duty to be more open and accountable. Lockdown 3.0 is a six-week stress test of the Premier’s competence, integrity and leadership.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
RBA holds tight as outlook lifts	The Australian	Long-term economic damage from COVID is less than from the GFC As confidence builds in the global rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, the economic outlook is lifting. Lasting damage from the pandemic now is expected to be less than that caused by the 2008 global financial crisis. Australia is at the forefront of the bounce-back along with the US, which the International Monetary Fund expects to be the only large economy that will have a bigger gross domestic product next year than was forecast before the pandemic hit.
Stimulus spending and government support have cushioned the impact of the shock caused by the emergence of COVID-19. Without these support measures, the IMF says, the global economic collapse last year would have been about three times as large. The IMF has also urged governments to be cautious in removing support.
The Morrison government is using the momentum of the domestic recovery to wind back its JobKeeper program while keeping in place targeted assistance for industries that are still exposed, such as airlines and tourism. The Reserve Bank of Australia made it clear on Tuesday it was in no hurry to pull the brake on low interest rates, which are helping to fuel the domestic recovery despite a strong rise in house prices. RBA governor Philip Lowe has held firm on his expectation that record low interest rates will persist for at least the next three years. He says the RBA board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range. For this to occur, wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently. This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. Dr Lowe says the RBA does not expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest. Booming house prices will not be enough to push the RBA off course. Rather, the bank is seeking to “jawbone” expectations that lending requirements will tighten if there is a strong return by investors rather than owner-occupiers to the housing market.
As things stand, Dr Lowe says that while housing credit growth has picked up for owner-occupiers and first-home buyers, investor credit growth remains subdued. The Reserve Bank is prepared to keep flooding the economy with cheap money through its bond-buying program until the underlying strength improves. To help fund the housing and spending boom, authorised deposit-taking institutions have drawn $95bn under the RBA’s Term Funding Facility and have access to a further $95bn.
Dr Lowe says these various monetary measures are continuing to help the economy by keeping financing costs very low, contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise, and supporting the supply of credit and household and business balance sheets. Similar stimulus measures taken internationally have set a path for global recovery. IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath says a way out of the health and economic crisis is increasingly visible. The IMF has raised its global GDP growth forecast to 6 per cent this year and 4.4 per cent next year.
The danger is that governments and institutions such as the IMF will become addicted to spending on programs, not focused on pandemic recovery. A large part of the IMF’s latest global outlook report is geared around transitioning the COVID-19 spending into continued programs for fashionable causes that fit in with the UN’s Millennium Development Goals. As Adam Creighton reports on Wednesday, the IMF has called on nations to redouble climate-change mitigation efforts. “Once the health crisis is over, policy efforts can focus more on building resilient, inclusive and greener economies, both to bolster the recovery and to raise potential output,” the IMF says. To give context to the challenge, the lockdown last year cut global carbon dioxide emissions by 4 per cent. They would need to fall by the same proportion every year for the next 30 years to lower global emissions 80 per cent by 2050. Trillions of dollars are being earmarked for the UN’s so-called Build Back Better agenda. Imposing the template of the COVID-19 response to the climate change agenda, both socially restrictive and economically profligate, has become a focus of green groups around the world. With recovery now under way, the challenge for policymakers is to ensure that future spending includes a proper cost-benefit analysis to ensure measures are delivering what they promise in the most efficient way.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Wood had substance and style	The Australian	Long-time readers will remember our former economics editor and columnist, Alan Wood, who has died aged 76. In his inimitable style, Wood retired in 2008 “after more than 40 federal budgets”. The “last straw was when Wayne Swan put a coloured cover on this year’s Budget Paper No 1. What next, his photograph?” To the dismay of those whose spin Wood scrutinised, and to the delight of readers who never missed him, Wood continued writing columns.
As Alan Howe writes in his obituary, Wood’s father, a jockey, lost a leg and became a racehorse trainer. Wood’s mother died when her son was six. After Randwick primary and Sydney Boys High schools, Wood started as a cadet on The Australian Financial Review and majored in economics at the Australian National University. Perhaps his background — Aussie grit, not silver spoons — honed his talent to cut through sham. Wood valued the “worthy but dull” Productivity Commission and its telephone directory-sized reports for saving us from “the folly of politicians” and vested interests. One of his favourites, in 2006, was a report on garbage that “laid waste” to “the great hoax” of “feral plastic bags overrunning the country”. On that subject, Wood was ultimately on the losing side of the debate, although as a provocateur he never minded challenging popular views. On free markets and trade, he was a visionary who tackled protectionism and pushed reforms that delivered decades of national prosperity.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Premiers are pulling the handbrake on recovery	The Australian	Low COVID-19 case numbers show contract tracing can be relied on
This year, the silly season certainly is living up to its nomenclature. How else to explain a precipitous closure of state borders with the resultant traffic chaos as the holiday dreams of families and business owners are dashed? It is an absurdity matched only by repeated calls that Australia muscle its way to the front of the COVID-19 vaccine queue against nations suffering caseloads that constitute a real and present pandemic emergency. Behind the political fearmongering and bureaucratic overreach from premiers outside NSW stands the reality of Australia’s mercifully low coronavirus case numbers: nil on Monday in NSW, with two known that will be reported on Tuesday, and three in Victoria. Queensland has not had community transmission for 111 days. The last time an active case was found outside of quarantine was 18 days ago.
This is not good enough news for a nation of armchair epidemiologists who want the Sydney New Year’s Test against India to be abandoned or at least played to a silent ground without spectators. There are reasons to be alert to the threat posed by the outbreak that started as a cluster on Sydney’s northern beaches. The virus has spread to other parts of Sydney and leaked across state borders in a limited way. There have been worrying lapses of social distancing regulations by some venues. But the numbers still speak to the competence and professionalism of the teams of contact tracers that government is depending on to keep the spread of the virus in check.
The same cannot be said for the ham-fisted state planners in Victoria who have put thousands of citizens into compulsory quarantine for visiting NSW, even to areas where there have been no recorded cases. Anecdotal evidence from the Victoria-NSW border is of marathon delays and rising tempers as holiday-makers rushed back from as far away as the NSW north coast to beat a deadline of even harsher measures.
To add to confusion, Victorian health authorities have been unable to deliver a clear message on potential coronavirus exposure sites. Wrong sites have been listed and later revised, sometimes to other locations hours away on the other side of the Great Dividing Range. Mistakes happen but authoritarian bungling adds to the misery for businesses that had been counting on holiday travel to overcome the heartache of lockdowns. In what is becoming a sharpened political contest between states, NSW has kept its head and remains the gold standard. Premier Gladys Berejiklian has taken leave and her deputy, Nationals leader John Barilaro, said he was “confident” the state was equipped to host the Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. It is not a laissez-faire endeavour, however. Spectator numbers have been reduced further and rural residents are being asked to reconsider attendance to avoid the risk of spreading the virus to areas that currently are unaffected.
Mr Barilaro also has criticised Western Australia for being unnecessarily interfering. He said NSW was doing the heavy lifting by quarantining returning travellers destined for other states. More than 100,000 passengers had been processed in Sydney, with about half going to other states after quarantine. Given the criticisms of other premiers, Mr Barilaro said NSW could forward passengers straight to other jurisdictions to be processed in their home state. West Australian Premier Mark McGowan urged NSW to stick to the national agreement that visitors or returning residents be quarantined at their point of entry. Mr McGowan accused Mr Barilaro of “not acting as an Australian”.
Squabbling among premiers is not new, particularly around election time, as is the case in WA. The outbreak of parochialism does not bode well for the state of co-operative federalism. Federal Labor’s answer is to shield state governments from responsibility and pass the additional cost to the commonwealth. Research by accounting firm KPMG estimates the northern beaches outbreak and lockdown cost the economy $3.2bn in lost working hours last month. This will be enough to slow but not stop the economic rebound that began in the September quarter. The KPMG research demonstrates that even NSW’s more measured approach to suppressing the outbreak comes at significant cost. Closing state borders and introducing harsh quarantine regimes comes with an even bigger bill attached.
Anthony Albanese’s call for the JobKeeper payment to be maintained at its 2020 level is the wrong response. The federal Opposition Leader argues reducing JobKeeper will hurt individuals, families and business by reducing economic activity when we know there is “still a major handbrake on the economy”. It is premiers who are unnecessarily pulling the brake.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
English vital to enter university	The Australian	Lowering standards will erode our credibility in the long run It is in the interests of the nation, of current and future Australian students, of universities themselves and of international students that high academic standards remain the hallmark of our tertiary education sector. For that reason, we welcome the call by the University of Sydney Business School’s international academic director, John Shields, for higher entry standards for international students — especially in their level of English proficiency.
Many academics, students and their families know that the concern raised in a new ­report prepared for the Business Council and Asia Society is valid. The overwhelming number of Chinese students in some university classrooms has ­stymied free discussion, especially in tutorials, and made it hard to encourage academic integrity, as Tim Dodd reported on Thursday.
In China, the number and quality of universities is growing. As Professor Shields says, Australian universities need to adapt to that development and look to the best Chinese universities as “peers and competitors in the international education market” and prospective research collaborators. We should also broaden our international student base, while insisting on English proficiency for all-comers. Even if some applicants do not make the cut without improving their English, lifting standards will stand us in good stead. It will also improve the on-campus experience of many Australian students.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Consumers the winners in Big Tech payment laws	The Australian	Maintaining vibrant local journalism is in everyone’s best interests Australian consumers will benefit most from planned new laws to make Big Tech pay a fair price to use content produced by major media organisations. The proposed legislation announced yesterday by the federal government has made some significant concessions to Google and Facebook. But it has maintained the final offer arbitration model recommended by the world-leading report by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission.
The laws forcing digital companies to negotiate terms for content will extend to public broadcasters. The draft code now will be considered by a Senate committee before it goes to a vote. Digital groups have signalled they will continue to lobby for changes but there has been bipartisan support for new laws to safeguard the production of quality journalism in Australia. The federal government says the code will support a diverse and sustainable Australian news media sector by encouraging the parties to undertake commercial negotiations outside the code.
Digital platforms will be encouraged to publish standard offers to provide smaller news media businesses with an efficient pathway to finalising agreements. A negotiation framework will be established under the code to allow the digital and media companies to bargain in good faith to reach binding agreements. If parties are unable to reach agreement an independent arbiter will be able to determine the level of remuneration that should be paid under a fair and balanced final offer arbitration model. During any arbitration, arbiters must consider the benefits for both parties from having Australian news content available on digital platforms. They also must take into account the cost of producing news content and whether any final decision places an undue burden on the digital platforms.
While the arbitration framework must consider two-way value exchange between the parties, payment can flow only from digital platforms to news media businesses. The code also imposes obligations on digital platforms to ensure that they cannot seek to avoid the code or retaliate against news media businesses. It will be illegal for digital platforms to disadvantage news content by altering the way they index or distribute available news to favour one news media over another. Digital platforms will be required to give publishers 14 days’ advance notice of deliberate algorithm changes that affect news media businesses. The proposed legislation includes stiff penalties for failing to negotiate in good faith, failing to comply with arbitration or engaging in retaliatory action against news media companies. The maximum penalty is the greater of 10 per cent of annual Australian turnover, $10m or three times the benefit obtained. The proposed new laws have been toughly fought by the digital giants, which are under increasing pressure from legislators around the world. They have had partial success in watering down what had been initially proposed. The scope of the new laws will be limited in terms of which products offered by the digital giants it will apply to.
The new laws represent a breakthrough in forcing digital companies to pay for news content they distribute and will have global implications. Regulators have been co-operating across jurisdictions to combat what has been perceived as an unhealthy market dominance. In the US, the tech giants have been the target of an antitrust investigation and are facing a raft of class actions for uncompetitive behaviour. The ACCC recommendations that Facebook and Google pay publishers for content is seen as a template for what may happen in other countries. The ACCC’s digital platforms inquiry was a world-leading report covering privacy, media regulation and merger laws. The final report included 23 recommendations that addressed competition and consumer protection issues, media regulatory reforms and privacy. Both the ACCC report and the feedback from the consultation process emphasised the need for reform to better protect consumers, improve transparency, address power imbalances and ensure that substantial market power is not used to lessen competition in media and advertising services markets. The ACCC identified a bargaining power imbalance between news media organisations and certain large digital platforms, and made a recommendation that codes of conduct be negotiated between news media businesses and designated digital platforms. Communications Minister Paul Fletcher says the relationship between Big Tech and the media is a competition policy issue and a media policy issue. “If the enormous market power of the digital platforms were to drive media businesses out of operation and in turn compromise the diversity and sustainability of the Australian media sector, that would be a bad outcome for our nation and our democracy,” Mr Fletcher said. The bottom line is that Australian consumers are the ones who stand to benefit most. During the past 12 months we have seen Australians turning in record numbers to news sources they know and trust from a range of media outlets. Because of this, it’s important for consumers that the major tech platforms come to the negotiating table to reach agreements with verified and trusted news publishers. This will benefit Australians by sustaining strong and vibrant local journalism.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Pandemic capitalism with Australian characteristics	The Australian	Mammoth coronavirus responses build on our capability
On Monday, new social restrictions came into effect in Australia, with a two-person limit for outside gatherings to contain the spread of coronavirus. New Zealand has closed its borders to nonresidents, as we have, and declared a state of emergency. New York State extended its emergency “pause”, asking non-essential workers to stay home until April 15. In Sweden, life carries on as normal, with public health officials arguing COVID-19 can be stopped solely by vaccination or herd immunity. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is defying calls to stop gatherings because of “a little flu”. “The virus is here, we’re going to have to confront it. Confront it like a man, not a boy!” he told his nation. Brazil had a similar number of infections to ours on Sunday, about 4000; it had 114 deaths compared with 16 here. The pandemic sees countries going it alone, both medically and economically, doing what suits them based on means, culture and capability.
That’s the context for the historic and eye-watering in scale $130bn JobKeeper package of wage subsidies announced on Monday by Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg. It’s the third fiscal rescue effort in 18 days, mere “stimulus” now recast as a retro, low-sugar tonic. This move is sold as a lifeline. More like a vital organ donation. Australia progressively has been doing whatever it takes to “keep the engine running”, as the Prime Minister described it. That has seen $320bn, or one-sixth of the size of our economy, allocated to cushioning the blow from the pandemic. Remember, Canberra’s annual spending on everything is $500bn. Mr Morrison said now was the time to “dig deep”. We are lucky to live in a country where authorities are able to do so, although this will be paid for, and then some, by taxpayers long after the calamity is over. It’s a gobsmacking remaking of our economy, if only temporarily.
We are fashioning an evolving strain of crisis capitalism with Australian characteristics. The new package will give eligible employers — those whose revenues have plunged by 30 per cent or more — a $1500 per fortnight wage subsidy for six months to retain each worker who was on their books at the start of this month. By binding workers and employers in this way, the scheme does a few clever things. One, it means the recovery, when it comes, will be swifter. Two, workers will have a better chance of maintaining skills. Three, it will keep people on existing payrolls and be administered by the Australian Taxation Office. Four, it will take pressure off welfare infrastructure, such as Centrelink. Five, it applies to a broad category of workers. “This is about keeping the connection between the employer and the employee and keeping people in their jobs even though the business they work for may go into hibernation and close down for six months,” Mr Morrison said. The government estimates that six million workers, including contractors, sole traders and casuals, will benefit.
Mr Morrison emphasises the flat JobKeeper payment, unlike the British scheme that guarantees 80 per cent of salary, is a better fit with our social egalitarianism. It will, however, cost a lot more. The Treasurer said $1500 a fortnight was equivalent to 70 per cent of the national median wage or 100 per cent of the median income for workers in the most affected sectors: hospitality, retail and tourism. At face value, Mr Frydenberg’s wage-subsidy scheme has taken the best aspects of the British and New Zealand models. Perhaps it is the “last mover” advantage. As well, to iron out welfare system anomalies and likely snags for families where a partner loses a job, the government has temporarily adjusted partner income tests to just below $80,000 for JobSeeker payment.
Even though this is a policy move without precedent, it does fit our values. It certainly fits with desperate times. And it fits with the government’s rhetoric from the start that responses would be scalable, proportionate, targeted and within existing delivery systems. Again, Mr Morrison is fighting a war on two fronts; he is not choosing the economy over health, or vice versa. His mantra is saving “lives and livelihoods”. Given how swift the play, it’s remarkable that he has been able to switch between two modes. Having immense financial resources from the start — and being prepared to ditch long-held conservative doctrines — has been an advantage for Mr Morrison and his custodian. Whether it is fiscal overkill will become apparent only well after the crisis. It will take fortitude to wind back this mammoth expansion of the state; not so much the taking away as the paying back.“Capable states,” posits veteran strategic analyst Allan Gyngell, “whether democratic or authoritarian, will address the health and social problems more effectively and get their economies moving faster when the crisis passes.” Like Singapore and Germany, he argues, Australia is likely to be among those successful states due to effective public institutions. With so many different paths taken, it’s a time to keep our heads and trust our fundamentals: experts, officials and delivery systems. That doesn’t mean we ignore lessons of good practice: South Korea’s testing regime, Singapore’s contact tracing or Germany’s wage subsidies. Nor should we revert to jingoism. That’s as much a test for Mr Morrison and his medical and economics brains as it is for armchair epidemiologists or those advocating a radical course. For now, we are in a position of strength. Even if there are missteps, our endowments, core values and newly super-sized public sector can beat this devastating biological foe.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
EDITORIAL Winter of discontent in America	The Northern Advocate	Many election choices are not clear-cut. But at Friday’s final election debate, United States voters got two vastly different takes on the big issue of the year.
Former Vice-President Joe Biden said the US was heading into “a dark winter” without a clear plan on the pandemic while President Donald Trump said the coronavirus would “go away”.
When Trump said “we’re learning to live with it,” Biden retorted that “we’re learning to die with it”.
Biden emphasises practical ways to combat the virus now, while Trump dangles vaccine deliverance in a few months.
Scientists have been predicting a surge for some time. On Saturday the Covid Tracking Project reported 83,010 new cases in the US. The previous record for one day was 77,000 in July.
Hospitalisations and deaths are rising again, although daily fatalities are half the peaks seen in April. Healthcare workers have been able to lower mortality rates through increased knowledge of the virus and medical approaches. Two studies show a drop in deaths in all groups, including older patients or those with underlying conditions.
The record worldwide for daily infections is held by India with 97,890 on September 17. In Europe, France has become the second country in the region to pass a million cases after Spain, with 42,030 new cases in one day.
Such problems dwarf New Zealand’s issues of loopholes over our port workers and international shipping crews, amid calls for stricter rules. Still, we can fortunately deal with isolated problems as they arise rather than be swamped by infections.
The colder weather in the Northern Hemisphere will mean more indoor living ahead — the best spreading conditions for the coronavirus.
Biden has a grasp of what’s required to turn the situation around. But even if he wins the US election in 10 days, he would not pick up the reins until mid-January.
On Saturday he restated his plans which include pushing governors and mayors to implement mask mandates. A new study in Nature finds if 85 per cent of Americans wore masks, 95,000 people could be saved.
Yet Trump, holding yet another crowded rally in Florida with few masks in sight, insisted that “we’re entering the final turn and approaching the light at the end of the tunnel”. Trump can point to growing confidence that vaccines will be available soon. AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have gained approval from regulators to resume their US trials.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Our wellbeing depends on clear communication lines	The Australian	Many people still don’t know what to do or who to believe
Ahead of its fiscal stimulus package, the Morrison government has rolled out a $2.4bn health plan to support primary care, aged care, hospitals, research and the national medical stockpile to fight the coronavirus outbreak. That’s well and good. But after decisive, early action at the border via travel bans, and moving to a pandemic setting ahead of others, it’s puzzling that the public remains inadequately informed on the most basic questions of how to respond to COVID-19. The government has set aside $30m for an all-media national communications campaign on practical advice in containing the virus and staying healthy. But why is it taking so long to get going?
Sure, we are in a fast-moving situation, with health systems adjusting alert levels and mobilising resources by the day. A national hotline has been overwhelmed by callers; confusion within a vast health system has seen patients given conflicting advice. People seeking tests have struggled to find out what symptoms justified immediate action. The Australian Medical Association asked patients not to clog up the system with unnecessary testing. But most people, trawling through websites, could not easily tell who should be tested, where and when? At the launch of the health plan, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said there was no point being tested for COVID-19 if you had not travelled or if you had not been in contact with an infected person — even if you had flu-like symptoms. At the moment, there is only one element of significant public transmission and “that’s small and controlled in Sydney”, Dr Murphy said. People who don’t need it are putting an undue burden on testing; capacity is being ramped up through 100 dedicated respiratory clinics and new pathology services in aged care and elsewhere. But the rollout is still six weeks away.
To date, mixed messaging — not always the fault of Canberra — has hindered community action and caused worry. That’s a risk in a federal system, with six states, two territories, a national government and overlapping duties across an entire continent. Scott Morrison claims we are “as well-prepared as any country in the world”. The response has been led by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the key decision-making body for health emergencies, yet they have not directly run the information campaign. Australia would benefit from a body such as the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, a one-stop, authoritative agency for data, alerts, advice and research. In this crisis, the CDC is proving to be a global resource, America’s gift to the world.We recognise media have a role to play. Misreporting of Health Minister Greg Hunt triggered a rush to testing centres this week. In trying to reassure the public, the Prime Minister said on Wednesday that medical experts had been “preparing for an event like this for years” and we had the “right tools, information and resources” to keep Australians safe. Did someone lose or forget the comms plan? As we argued on Tuesday, a nationally co-ordinated information push — across multiple platforms — will help overcome rising anxieties and uncertainties. It must be a higher priority. The sooner a mass information effort is rolling, the better we will be able to fight COVID-19.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
We say Easter’s not as usual but nothing is	The New Zealand Herald	Many things may be absent but we do have the chance to take stock and be grateful for what we do have
Happy Easter, everyone!
Okay, so it’s not the Easter break many of us would have chosen.
We won’t be heading out on the highway to our holiday homes or campsites for a last break away before winter sets in. We won’t be hitting the beach for a swim or a surf, we won’t be heading for the hills to go tramping and we won’t be going bush for some hunting with our mates. We won’t even be going to church.
On the bright side, we haven’t had to plan, organise or pay for a getaway. We won’t be sitting in traffic queues for hours at each end of the long weekend, and there won’t be the heartbreaking reality of the annual Easter road toll to deal with for some.
There is no doubt there will be hardship and loneliness and despair, however — particularly for some of those living alone, those living in violent homes and relationships, those dealing with poverty and those living on the street or in other difficult circumstances. There is, of course, ongoing anxiety and uncertainty for many of us, regarding our health, homes, businesses, jobs and livelihoods. Some are already grieving the loss of work. And a handful of New Zealand families are facing the ultimate grief and fear as the virus takes a far more personal toll.
But this Easter, many of us are still able to spend time with friends and family — albeit it in our lockdown bubbles — and enjoy the usual hot cross buns and chocolate treats.
It is, perhaps, a chance to take stock and be grateful for what we do have. An opportunity for us all — believers or not — to reflect on the true meaning of Easter, on the nature of sacrifice, rebirth and salvation, which seem particularly poignant as we pass the halfway point of lockdown and begin to consider what life may look like on the other side of it.
So, as well as re-evaluating our personal circumstances, and setting the world to rights as armchair critics, just what activities can we do and where can we go this Easter lockdown weekend?
Although Health Minister David Clark has been left with more than just Easter egg on his face after his interpretation of the exercise and travel rules, and National leader Simon Bridges’ defence of his 500km essential-worker commutes between Wellington and Tauranga is debatable, the messages for Easter in lockdown remain exactly the same as they have been throughout from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield. That is “stay home”. And, if you must go out to provide or use essential services or get some exercise, “stay local”.
Police have been focused on education and encouragement but they are now moving into a clear enforcement phase and clamping down on lockdown transgressors, as evidenced by the fact the number of arrests is slowly but surely rising. Police will also be manning checkpoints to prevent people heading away to holiday hotspots.
All of Government Controller John Ombler has said, on several occasions since the lockdown was announced, that if people are trying to find ways to get around the rules, and not playing the game, they are not taking the pandemic seriously enough and are putting other New Zealanders’ lives at risk.
That is surely enough for each one of us to make the right decision.
Remember, every time you leave the house — even under the exceptions, you put yourself and essential workers at risk. The whole purpose of the alert level 4 lockdown is to minimise that risk.
So, when it comes to Easter activities, not only should we adhere to the letter of the law (that now officially means no fishing, swimming, surfing, hunting and tramping), but we need to also follow the spirit of the rules, the entire purpose of which are to protect us all.
When it comes to exercise, while cycling and scootering are allowed, be careful out there folks. And maybe just take a brisk walk around the block instead. Get the kids to look out for the latest neighbourhood attraction as part of The Big New Zealand Easter Hunt.
Continue to avoid park benches and playgrounds. And keep the car for accessing essential services — not your favourite scenic spot.
If you don’t really need to go to the supermarket or dairy, then don’t — and certainly not just because you have a craving for a certain item or feel like getting out.
If you want to do some DIY, ask yourself if it really has to be done this weekend or in the next two weeks. The very last thing emergency services and health professionals need right now is being put at risk of infection and clogging up vital hospital beds with people who have injured themselves falling off the roof while waterblasting, electrocuting themselves while drilling, or cutting themselves on the chainsaw ... Okay, it’s no picnic, but neither’s the alternative.
Anyone doubting that should take pause and read up about the terrifying impact of the virus in the UK, New York, Italy or Spain. What we are all doing appears to be working. But we need to keep doing it until the coast is clear.
And remember, this Easter, like the rest of lockdown, we don’t have to lose weight, write a bestselling novel, reclad the entire house, or homeschool our 5-year-olds to scholarship level. We have one job to do: stay put and not infect anyone, while being kind to ourselves and others.
So go on, have that extra Easter egg, you deserve it, New Zealand!	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Cormann steps up to world stage	The Australian	Mathias Cormann’s election as secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will boost Australia’s influence in the world at a crucial time of post-pandemic recovery. It is, as Scott Morrison says, “the most senior appointment of an Australian candidate to an international body for decades”. The former finance minister’s eight years working for three prime ministers and three treasurers honed his mastery of complex detail and his ability to drive economic policy. His articulate advocacy in German, French and Flemish — he did not learn English until he was 23, although he is now intensely Australian — will be an asset leading the OECD’s secretariat and council. It includes ambassadors from 37 member states and the European Commission.
Mr Cormann, 50, was elected from an original field of 10, despite strong lobbying against him by green groups that favoured the runner-up, Swedish politician Cecilia Malmstrom. But, despite perceptions that Australia is not doing enough on climate, we have deployed renewables 25 per cent faster than Europe’s four largest economies combined. On a per capita basis, from 2005 to 2018, Australia cut emissions by 29 per cent compared with 16 per cent in Germany. As Mr Cormann says, action on climate change, to be effective, needs an ambitious, globally co-ordinated approach. Mr Morrison lobbied more than 50 world leaders on Mr Cormann’s behalf and supported his campaign. And the support of Australia’s great ally, the US, was crucial. Given the importance of the Asia-Pacific, his knowledge of the region and experience in dealing with China would have added to his appeal. So did our leadership in confronting tech giants. As like-minded democracies, OECD members will have a vital role as the international order resets post-COVID and deals with its hefty legacy of debt. Australians can be proud Mr Cormann is the person best equipped for the task. That said, he was a big loss to Australian politics.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Back to school part of the recovery, but in good time	The Australian	Medical experts are consistent in their advice on education
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy was looking ahead on Monday when he said opening schools and lifting limits on the size of gatherings would be among the first measures the Morrison government would look at relaxing when medical experts were satisfied community transmission of COVID-19 was under control. That approach is consistent with the expert health advice Dr Murphy and others have provided to governments since the start of the pandemic. It has served the nation well.
The restrictions enacted have contained Australia’s caseload to a level that is the envy of most G20 nations. The medical advice early on was to leave schools open. In schools where small outbreaks of coronavirus occurred, they were dealt with swiftly, with the schools temporarily closed and those in close contact with patients tracked and tested. As caseload numbers rose, increasing numbers of parents chose to keep their children at home. After a few days, this became an overwhelming majority. Some independent schools shut up shop; and most schools took important initiatives to provide digital and online education.
The Easter holidays were a welcome respite, albeit a crowded one in many homes. Now it is decision time again — for families, teachers, principals and governments. There is no need to rush and no need for parents to panic at the thought of sending their children back to crowded classrooms, corridors, playgrounds and lunch areas when in the outside world individuals are not yet allowed to sit alone in a park, drive to one’s own holiday home or cross the NSW-Queensland border. Teachers unions also are concerned. “Somehow it’s OK for hundreds of students and hundreds of teachers to be together at school and that’s safe,” Queensland Teachers Union president Kevin Bates said on Monday. But not yet. The unions, sensibly, are seeking protections for vulnerable staff and calling for effective hygiene measures.
Dr Murphy made it clear on Monday that it is too early to talk about relaxing restrictions. But he was equally clear that schools would be the first priority of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee when it ultimately came to relaxing restrictions. That strategy is well-founded: “We haven’t yet seen significant student-to-student transmission.” The AHPPC also is working on advice for the national cabinet on how to make schools safer learning environments, to prevent transmission between children and to protect teachers. The AHPPC advice remains that schools should be open but that strict social-distancing measures, such as cancelling school assemblies and maintaining personal hygiene rules, should be in place. Last week, Education Minister Dan Tehan warned non-government schools that they must also open at the beginning of term two to cater for the children of essential workers and vulnerable minors. If they refuse, their taxpayer funding will be in jeopardy.
In addition to wanting to protect their children’s health, parents reading up about COVID-19 are also worried about the potential of children, who can be asymptomatic “silent spreaders” of the disease, to infect other family members. Such fears, however, should be allayed by the prudent approaches being taken by the states. In Victoria, where term two starts on Wednesday, on-site classes will be available only to students who cannot learn from home for the entire term. In Queensland, term two starts next Monday. Children will engage in home-based learning for at least the first five weeks. Schools will be open only for essential-care workers’ children and vulnerable students, with no more than 12 students to be permitted in a classroom. In NSW, where the new term starts on April 27, arrangements will be announced soon. By the end of term one, 95 per cent of NSW students were staying home, on the advice of Premier Gladys Berejiklian. Hastening slowly, as the states and schools are doing, is wise — especially from a health perspective.From a broader perspective, the return to school will be a significant stepping stone in the nation’s economic recovery from COVID-19. Overseeing children’s lessons, depending on their ages, is demanding for parents working from home. It is hard to do both things well. As a short-term measure, home learning has been considered necessary by parents to protect their children and reduce the spread of COVID-19. But cocooning by workers and their children should not be regarded as a viable proposition for any longer than is essential. The nation cannot afford to let it become the new normal. The national cabinet is right in wanting to get children back at school.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Forging a recovery while containing a mini-spike	The Australian	Melbourne’s lockdown must be short, sharp and effective The last day of the 2019-20 financial year was a significant point in Australia’s post-coronavirus recovery. Despite Melbourne’s COVID-19 woes, the nation overall is moving steadily towards functioning alongside the virus. We are in a position many other countries, such as the US, which had more than 38,000 new cases overnight, can only envy. Outbreaks in Melbourne during the past fortnight are unlikely to be Australia’s last mini-spikes as we learn to balance opening up the economy with containing the virus. While COVID-19 remains abroad, elimination is not a realistic prospect at this stage, authorities agree. But the necessary severity of the stay-at-home measures announced on Tuesday by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, to be reinforced with police patrols, should be a wake-up call. Restricting residents from 37 northern and western Melbourne suburbs to leaving their homes only for work, school, care or care-giving, daily exercise and buying food and essentials is a reminder of the cost of ignoring vital precautions against the virus. Other postcodes could follow if the outbreak is not contained. Hand sanitising, social distancing and staying home when ill must be practised by all as life returns to something resembling what it was before the pandemic. Victoria’s restrictions, appropriately, are extensive, localised, proportionate and temporary. They will, however, slow the recovery of our second-largest state and that of the national economy.
Better late than never, and in time for the second week of NSW school holidays, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk will open her state’s borders from July 10 to visitors from all states except Victoria. She also has eased restrictions for sporting stadiums, restaurants, cafes, bars, casinos, churches and gatherings. The internal measures are expected to be worth about $1.8bn a month and 167,000 jobs. The relaxation of borders will help the struggling airline industry. It also will be the difference between some hard-pressed businesses surviving or going bankrupt, and workers holding their jobs or lining up for the dole, especially in areas such as Cairns, the Whitsundays, the Gold and Sunshine coasts. For now South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania remain in limbo for no good reason. In the public interest, the least they should do is adopt an approach similar to that of Queensland. They should be rational and brave, open up and exclude Victorians until the mini-outbreak is under control. Not unreasonably, people entering Queensland from Victoria will, for now, be made quarantine at their own expense.
While making sensible announcements, Ms Palaszczuk could not resist a churlish dummy spit. With an eye on the state election in three months, no doubt, and knowing that a bit of Canberra-bashing normally goes down well in her state, she whined that Queensland had been “singled out”. Scott Morrison, she complained, had allowed “border wars” to erupt between states and territories. These, in reality, were fanned by state leaders, especially Ms Palaszczuk herself and WA Premier Mark McGowan. The Morrison government has been consistent — borders should be open, in line with medical advice to the commonwealth. In so far as Queensland was “singled out”, it was to point out the catastrophic cost to its tourism industry of its border closures.
The Morrison government must turn its attention to one of the supreme paradoxes that has emerged as sectors of the economy return to normal. On Tuesday’s front page, we revealed that despite surging unemployment, business owners are struggling to recruit staff as some of the jobless opt for the dole over work. From the outset, we cautioned that some of the federal government’s COVID-19 assistance measures would need to be wound back as soon as practical: “The fiscal response is not a permanent condition,” we said on April 3. “The state may be your mate now. When this crisis passes, let’s get back on our own feet.” National Skills Commission data shows one in two employers who are struggling to recruit workers say their main challenge is a lack of applicants. That suggests it is time to dispense with measures creating an impediment to rebuilding the workforce, at least in regions and sectors on the road to recovery. Anecdotal reports suggest small and large businesses are affected, the Prime Minister has said. JobSeeker is costing taxpayers and the budget bottom line about $1.7bn a fortnight, including $826m for the coronavirus supplement, which is due to finish on September 24. If it is impeding the productive economy it should be reviewed sooner not later, with a view to reducing the impost on taxpayers.
It is an encouraging sign that employers have taken about 250,000 Australians back on to their books since mid-April. This represents about a third of the jobs lost in the initial four weeks of the COVID-19 crisis. There remains a long way to go, however, with Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing there are still 670,000 fewer payroll jobs than before the pandemic. Business lending fell by 0.6 per cent in May, the steepest fall in nine years, suggesting many businesses remain in “survival mode’’ rather than looking to invest and expand. As Citi chief economist Josh Williamson says, the signs are good but recovery is slow. Confidence among consumers and businesses will be vital in building a return to prosperity. That is why, aside from dealing with temporary COVID-19 setbacks with short, sharp measures, it is vital to avoid a “stop, go, stop, go” approach to opening up economic and everyday life, as Mr Morrison has said. At the start of a new financial year, governments must learn from mistakes in Victoria and other states — such as too relaxed an approach to Black Lives Matter protests that sent the public the wrong messages and lack of screening of all overseas arrivals in quarantine. Australia, while far ahead of most nations in opening up, remains on a steep learning curve. The challenges are rebuilding, growth and embarking on economic reform while containing what is a stubborn, relentless virus.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Porter pulls back from IR war	The Australian	Memories of the Work Choices storm force a pragmatic retreat
The bitter experience of Work Choices continues to mean that any changes to Australia’s industrial relations laws must be incremental at best, to avoid wide-ranging changes that risk substantially offending either side of the debate. Faced with the beginnings of a Work Choices-style revolt from unions and the ALP, Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter has quickly signalled he is not prepared to die in a ditch on the issue and will opt to take what measures he can.
From the outset, Mr Porter badged his reform agenda as being co-operative and focused on jobs. But he didn’t consult widely on the detail and the ACTU and Labor have quickly exploited this fact to attack the proposal. The exception was legislation that has the potential to isolate the militant leadership of the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union by allowing the super union to demerge. The CFMEU’s Victorian construction division secretary, John Setka, has fallen out with federal Labor and the ACTU. On this issue at least, for Anthony Albanese and ACTU secretary Sally McManus, it appears to be a case of “my enemy’s enemy is my friend”.
On IR reform more broadly, after a period of co-operation involving employers, government and the ACTU during the pandemic, all sides quickly reverted to type. The corpse of Work Choices quickly was being exhumed by opponents to push back on moves for greater workplace flexibility.
Mr Porter had sought to sell the government’s IR package as a compromise that was acceptable because, unlike earlier attempts, it stood a chance of success in making it through the parliament and into law. Reform purists criticised the approach as being too timid, leaving in place unnecessary complexity for employers with too much duplication and too many awards.
But events have shown that even measured IR reform is no easy task. The conflict point was efforts to relax provisions that insist no individual worker be left worse off, actually or theoretically. The mining industry welcomed the changes, saying they would help ensure that Australian mining kept providing highly paid, highly skilled and secure jobs across the nation. Industry said improving the approval process for enterprise agreements and stipulating how the Fair Work Commission should apply the better-off-overall test would result in more certainty for employers and faster creation of jobs and wage increases in exchange for productivity gains.
But the Opposition Leader told parliament the proposed legislation would cut the pay of essential workers and give too much power to employers. The fight was quickly reduced to a one-liner that it would be unfair to cut the wages of those who saved the nation from COVID. Ms McManus labelled the proposed changes as the worst attack on workers since Work Choices.
After Scott Morrison sought to defend the reforms as “job-creating and job-keeping changes”, Mr Porter capitulated on the BOOT. This is despite having argued the contentious change would apply in only a small number of cases, was time-limited and would last for only two years. To fight on would have given the ACTU a chance to relive the campaign that defeated John Howard. In addition, Mr Albanese had been handed an issue with the potential to inject relevance and energy into what has looked increasingly like a demoralised opposition. The government had little chance of pushing through in the Senate without Labor. One Nation said the proposed legislation would require “many, many, many changes” before the party would consider backing it. The government is to be congratulated for pushing ahead with reforms that make it easier for employers to hire and existing workers to keep their jobs. Given the history of IR reform, it is wise to be pragmatic, but the government must not capitulate entirely. With consumer and business confidence returning, attention must not be allowed to stray to the old politics of Work Choices but remain squarely focused on creating jobs.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Joe Biden has the momentum	The Australian	Message for Mr Trump is moderates have finally woken up
Joe Biden’s Super Tuesday success should give heart to US Democrats working to see their party nominate a plausible candidate to take on Donald Trump in November. Whether Barack Obama’s former vice-president can sustain the momentum of his surge against what had appeared to be the unstoppable candidacy of far-left democratic socialist Bernie Sanders remains to be seen. But exit polls across the 14 Super Tuesday states showed a movement in voter sentiment following Mr Biden’s unexpectedly strong win in South Carolina last weekend that could presage a dramatic shift in the race for the Democratic nomination and the contest against Mr Trump.
The exit polls showed Democrats prioritising “electability over issues”, with six out of 10 saying that defeating Mr Trump was their main priority. By a similar margin late deciders made up their minds only in the past few days, opting strongly for the moderate Mr Biden rather than Senator Sanders’s spendthrift socialism. This helped turn the race for the Democratic nomination upside down, with Mr Biden posting significant victories across a string of states, including Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Minnesota, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Oklahoma. He achieved a remarkable unexpected victory, too, in Massachusetts, home state of left-leaning senator Elizabeth Warren, pushing her into third place behind Senator Sanders in what was another telling win for Democratic moderates.
The momentum was strongly with Mr Biden. The prospect of seeing an avowed socialist at the top of the Democratic ticket clearly spooked many voters. It would be wrong, however, to see it as having been in any way terminal for Senator Sanders’s campaign. To the contrary, he won the biggest single prize, California, with its 415 delegates, and was in a tight race with Mr Biden for 228 Texas delegates. Significantly, he lost ground from his 2016 vote share, including his home state of Vermont, perhaps a portent of things to come. If there was a loser it was Mike Bloomberg who, in appearing on the ballot for the first time, spent $US215m ($326m) on advertising and ended up winning only in American Samoa, with its six delegates to the Democrats’ convention. In Virginia Mr Bloomberg spent $US18m compared with $US360,000 by Mr Biden, who went on to post a 53.3 per cent win. Senator Sanders, who had high hopes of winning the state, was on 23 per cent and Mr Bloomberg on 9.7 per cent. No wonder Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Bloomberg was “the biggest loser by far”.But the message for Mr Trump is that after months of debilitating incoherence, infighting and foolishly allowing Senator Sanders to make the running, the party’s moderates have finally woken up to the possibility his socialist extremism could lead them to the most devastating defeat since Richard Nixon trounced George McGovern in 1972. When the US, like most countries, is confronted by economic headwinds, Senator Sanders’s agenda, summed up in the friendly Washington Post as “Free stuff for everyone”, at an estimated cost of $US60 trillion over 10 years, looks even more bizarre. The Democrats’ nominating convention is not until July. Super Tuesday elected just 1357 of the 3979 delegates who will decide the party’s nominee. Mr Biden is no shoo-in. But he has boosted claims to be the moderate Democrat with the best chance of beating Mr Trump.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Music stops on industry pioneer	The Australian	Michael Gudinski is lauded for caring about those he showcased Rocker Jimmy Barnes summed up the loss of irrepressible music promoter Michael Gudinski, 68, when he said Gudinski’s untimely death in Melbourne on Tuesday had ripped the heart out of Australian music. It was a sentiment shared around the globe. Legendary US singer Bruce Springsteen said in 50 years on the road he had never met a better promoter.
Gudinski loved music and the people who played it. But, as Alan Howe writes on Wednesday, Gudinski was more than just music. He was a family man with a keen sense of business who was there for others and focused on doing the right thing. As Barnes said, “Michael was the rock I reached for when life tried to wash me away”.
Gudinski grew to become a highly influential figure who, despite being given the best opportunity at prestigious schools, did not have time for a formal education before taking on the world. He broke new ground with glam-rock band Skyhooks in the hypersexualised 1970s and went on to curate the soundtrack of a generation of Australians through his company, Mushroom Records.
Gudinski made his mark internationally with then aspiring soap opera star Kylie Minogue and went on to showcase some of the biggest names in rock ’n’ roll, including the Police and Rolling Stones, for a domestic audience. Business was not always smooth but Gudinski had a reputation for being there for others when they needed him.
Barnes said Australia’s music business turned, grew and moved forward because of Gudinski, describing him as a force of nature and a giant of a man. Gudinski had friends across the spectrum in business, media and politics. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews will offer the family a state funeral.
As well as his family and music, Gudinski loved his AFL team, St Kilda, and horse racing. He became a three-time Melbourne Cup winner last year when Twilight Payment won. Most of all, he cared about and delivered opportunity for others. The list of tributes to Gudinski reads like a Who’s Who of rock ’n’ roll from around the world. All of them have fond memories of a man who helped showcase their talents as best he could and, as a result, the talents of Australia.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Dutton must grasp Defence nettle at key strategic time	The Australian	Mike Pompeo’s blunt assessment of China cannot be ignored New Defence Minister Peter Dutton showed admirable forbearance on Sunday when he sent a strong message that Australia wants to work “collaboratively” with China to ensure peace in the Indo-Pacific. Mr Dutton’s constructive attitude gave the lie to claims in Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece the Global Times that he is a “hawkish” warmonger who will “stir up” and “further meddle” in tensions over the South China Sea. Mr Dutton emphasised Australia’s willingness to “work very closely with countries like China” in “a very important partnership”. He also left no doubt that Australia will remain unrelenting in strongly defending our national interests and working closely with allies — the US, Japan and India — to help keep the region remains free from conflict: “We don’t want to do that in an antagonistic way, we don’t support militarisation of ports, we don’t support any foreign country trying to exert influence here via cyber or other means.’’ Mr Dutton, our ninth Defence Minister in 14 years, has started the job methodically, telling Sky News on Sunday he has called for full briefings on all of Defence’s major programs, including the $90bn Attack-class subs and $45bn Hunter-class frigates. They must be delivered on time and on budget, without “slippage” of Australian industry content, he said. Mr Dutton should bring strength and gravitas to the portfolio at a crucial time. On Saturday, Trump-era CIA director and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo told Greg Sheridan the CCP is trying to “undermine democracy everywhere ”. After four years at the heart of Washington’s efforts to deal with China, Mr Pompeo understands the challenge the world faces. His view is that the CCP “deeply believes its Marxist/Leninist ideology is the right ideology for the world” and that it wants to impose it.
Mr Pompeo sees the Quadrilateral Dialogue, involving the US, Australia, Japan and India, as critical in resisting Chinese ­domination. The chief method of coercion Beijing ­employed was economic power, he said, citing recent trade actions against Australia. But the Quad nations between them were powerful enough to resist such ­coercion, he said. The US and its allies needed to make it clear to the CCP its continued abrogation of its international responsibilities — including any military action against Taiwan — would come at an enormous cost. Emphasising that point must be an important goal of the multilateral global alliance of democracies President Joe Biden is building to confront China.
From its mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan to its latest attempts to inject itself into the affairs of the Middle East, President-for-Life Xi Jinping’s regime is seeking to challenge Western strategic interests around the world. On Australia’s doorstep, China is seeking to further its influence by taking advantage of fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic on small countries. China has donated 200,000 of its Sinopharm jabs to PNG, and is pushing Pacific island states to accept its vaccines.
In the Middle East, the unprecedented so-called “axis” with Iran demonstrates China’s determination to spread its security and strategic interests. Beijing will invest some $US400bn in a variety of Iranian projects, including nuclear power, ports and oil and gas, helping Tehran overcome US sanctions. In return, China will receive a steady supply of Iranian oil and a major new market for Chinese weapons, potentially to use against Israel. Chinese cyber capacity and missile technology are now likely to now find their way to an ayatollah, as Mr Pompeo warned. Beijing will also gain major port facilities in Iran, including two close to the entrance to the Persian Gulf, giving China a vantage point on the waters through which much of the world’s oil passes. It has already built a series of ports along the Indian Ocean that has created a “necklace of refuelling and resupply stations” from the South China Sea to the Suez Canal. It opened its first full overseas military base in Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, in 2015. In Australia, the Morrison government’s decision to establish missile manufacturing is one of our nation’s most important strategic decisions in decades, as Sheridan wrote last week. After a long trail of unimpressive defence ministers, Mr Dutton has a vital opportunity to make his mark. Should the government be returned in the next year, Scott Morrison would do well to keep Mr Dutton in the job for at least another full parliamentary term.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Pricing our youth out of a job	The Australian	Minimum wage rise hinders small business and recovery The Fair Work Commission has taken an unnecessarily risky path by granting a $13-a-week increase in minimum and award wages during the nation’s worst economic downturn in almost 90 years. Sure, it has staggered the operative date across seven months to try to provide relief for sectors under most strain, such as retail, tourism, hospitality and the arts, as commission president Iain Ross had signalled. And yes, it was below the ACTU claim of $30 a week. But if ever there was a time for a wage freeze it is now. As panel member Mark Wooden put it in a dissenting view, no change to the minimum wage would “do little damage to workers” but a small increase would affect businesses. Employers argue we have the rich world’s highest minimum wage — the new minimum hourly rate will be $19.84 or $753.80 a week — and small businesses, in particular, will be swamped as they try to claw their way out of the deep COVID-19 recession.
Young workers and small firms are being hit especially hard during the downturn. The jobless rate for 15-to-24-year-olds is 16.1 per cent compared with 7.1 per cent for all workers, and is likely to rise. As Professor Wooden argued in his decision, since the global financial crisis there has been substantial deterioration in employment outcomes for our young people. “The COVID-19 pandemic will only make this worse,” he wrote, noting that entering the job market during a recession has significant damaging impacts on future job prospects and earnings. As well, small businesses, where award-reliant workers are over-represented, will find it more difficult to stay above water, given reduced access to credit and a lesser ability to diversify risk.
In a sense, the commission had got ahead of the game through generous earlier decisions for the low-paid, with rises above the inflation rate. A wage freeze this year still would leave them far better off than they were a decade ago. As Professor Wooden advised, in the current environment, the wage panel should be prioritising jobs and hours over a wage increase. A small rise would do very little to improve the welfare of an individual worker but risk reductions in hours of work or even job loss. And for the unemployed? Obviously a $13-a-week increase does nothing for the many thousands of workers who are not in a job. Some of the early, worst-case official forecasts — a 20 per cent plunge in gross domestic product, a 20 per cent slump in hours worked — are now looking excessively gloomy. In any case, the coming months are likely to be grim, especially for the record number of under-utilised workers, people not in a job plus those who would like more hours in their current role. The commission’s leap of faith makes the task of supply-side reform such as more workplace flexibility and innovation, less red tape and lower taxes even more urgent. If we are to give our young people and fledgling companies a decent chance of success, we need to ramp up the productivity agenda. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said on Monday that coming out of the pandemic Australians would be risk-averse and less eager to spend, borrow and invest so we need to change our game if we are to have a more dynamic economy. “We can borrow to build a bridge,” Dr Lowe said, both literally and figuratively. “But without reforms we will meander along with mediocre growth.” That was our fate before the coronavirus, with sagging productivity and living standards, plus now we’re on track for $1 trillion in net debt, with our most inexperienced workers needlessly priced out of a job.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Better Call Paul to stop piracy	The Australian	Minister for Google and Facebook must log on to the rescue
Jigsaw puzzles with the kids, Zoom meetings, cooking meals and taking the dog for a local walk fill the days in the time of coronavirus. Viewing streaming services such as Foxtel Now, Netflix and Amazon Prime is a diversion, too, given authorities have decreed we are not to leave home. Imagine if a pirate claimed all that original content, which is expensive to produce, and put it on a proprietary platform. Come and get it, folks, it’s free. And while you’re here, consider these ads from our sponsors. What a business model! No need to pay those actors on The Crown and Game of Thrones or the thousands of people producing binge-inducing gems such as Cheer or Tiger King. Got a problem with someone stealing your pay lunch, Netflix or Stan? You Better Call Paul. Except Communications Minister Paul Fletcher isn’t tuned into your problem.
That’s the essence of the existential crisis for the news business. Journalists, photographers and producers create stories, pictures, videos and podcasts. A team working around the world and around the clock makes the newspaper you’re reading — in print, on a tablet, smartphone or computer. On a mega- story such as the COVID-19 pandemic, changing by the minute, it’s a privilege and a grind. We inform readers and keep a close watch on decision-makers. But it’s a business as much as a mission. We exist because profits, as well as our values and wider social mission, attract investors. Yet our industry is collapsing. This week News Corp Australia, our parent, revealed it was suspending print editions of 60 local newspapers. Rivals also have put titles into hibernation.
This news crisis is not because media companies are inept or consumers have moved en masse to a better offering. In fact, as COVID-19 shows, people have never been hungrier for high-quality news. Our future is imperilled because Google and Facebook — ubiquitous, super-profitable, amoral, digital raiders — are inserting themselves between news outlets and customers. These two companies aren’t better at telling stories than we are; they don’t even try to compete on that score. What they’re expert at is gobbling up advertising revenue via algorithms that suck up our content. To add insult to injury, we are obliged to deal with these giants, which have privatised the internet. It’s naked theft, bullying and destructive. Again, Google and Facebook don’t employ news professionals, or take risks on expensive investigations, or support local communities. What they create is monopoly, mayhem and misery.
Google and Facebook are perfecting what Harvard’s Shoshana Zuboff has termed “surveillance capitalism”, where users are the product. But to snare you, they are bleeding us dry. Some believe all we are doing is moaning; that in an era of digital disruption, the tech titans won and we, traditional news providers, lost. Move along, nothing to see here except corporate road kill. But that’s a lazy, ignorant and reckless way to see the world. An independent analysis, albeit bracing for an open society, is contained in the far-reaching probe into digital platforms by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission. The watchdog’s role is not ideological social engineering or playing corporate god. Its job is to set market conditions for the good of the entire community.The ACCC report exposed the pernicious, unchecked power of the titans and fragility of traditional news outlets. The commission advised the Morrison government to impose a code of conduct; digital pirates should pay for the plundered content they profiteer from. The government timidly asked parties to negotiate a voluntary code or it would institute a mandatory one by year’s end. Google and Facebook are neither in a hurry nor acting in good faith. Why would they? Over a decade and more, governments have not had the wit to deal with core issues such as copyright, cross-media ownership and local content. Scandalously, politicians have been clueless bystanders to the implosion of media business models. They may not be “tech heads” but politicians sure understand raw power. Mr Fletcher urges the titans to improve “transparency” of their operations. Yet this misses the key point: fair pay for content. News outlets need a deal now. While our leaders are rightly focused on COVID-19, Mr Fletcher has a duty to push the foreign giants harder and to rescue local content, local stories and local voices from the cons’ rip-off virus.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Short-changing taxpayers on Shortfin Barracuda subs	The Australian	More Australian content was at the heart of the French deal
With the 2016 election campaign almost in sight, Malcolm Turnbull announced a $50bn fleet of 12 submarines to be built in Adelaide to the specifications of French company DCNS, now known as Naval Group. The “most sophisticated naval vessels being built in the world”, the then prime minister skited, would be “built here in Australia; built in Australia with Australian jobs, Australian steel, Australian expertise”. Like the troubled Collins-class subs they were replacing, the new Shortfin Barracudas would be serviced in Adelaide. At the time, we called out the “populist protectionism” behind the decision, which was more about shoring up jobs, local industry and votes in South Australia than getting the best boats at lowest cost for taxpayers in the shortest time to cover looming gaps in our defence capability. The build is set to begin in 2022.
Yet here we are, four years on, with the most expensive procurement in our history taking on water and running behind schedule. We know every piece of homemade defence equipment is more expensive and takes longer to build than kit bought off the shelf. Original Defence modelling showed it would cost 30 per cent more to build the new fleet here than to buy it directly from France. As well, a report by the Rand Corporation to government said the cost of building naval ships here was 30 to 40 per cent more than in foreign shipyards. But the Coalition opted for a bid it argued would foster technical and advanced manufacturing skills here, to revive the South Australian economy left reeling by the car industry’s exit.
Last month the Auditor-General found the program’s design phase was running nine months late. As we reported in November last year, the cost to build and maintain the new Attack-class subs will hit about $225bn across their 50-year lifespan. Previously Defence officials and the government had said it would cost $50bn to build and $50bn to sustain. But that was in “constant” dollars, which don’t account for inflation; the “out-turned”, or actual, dollars spent would be $80bn to build and a “rough estimate” of $145bn for maintenance. A week ago the ­government launched an audit of major defence projects to ensure sufficient work went to local firms. Now Naval Group says local firms may not get half of the value of the subs contracts and warns that the capability of defence suppliers is falling short of ­expectations. Chief executive John Davis says Naval Group is trying to bridge cultural issues. ­“We didn’t know the Australian market before we joined the program,” he told Ben Packham on Thursday, adding there is a lot more work to be done than anticipated. Oh dear, we’ve seen this movie before on big projects.
Naturally, politicians and companies are aghast. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said the state would be holding Canberra and Naval Group to original commitments that the bulk of the work would be done by local firms. As we report on Friday, Mr Davis will be hauled before the Senate economics committee that is reviewing naval shipbuilding. Naval Group is obliged to prioritise Australian suppliers; if it chooses to go offshore, Defence has a veto but must bear the subsequent risk. The Senate inquiry has heard that critical skills shortages of welders and engineers could set back delivery of submarines, frigates and patrol boats. We need to address those gaps and improve trades pathways from school, as well as address basic skills in maths.
In 2016, the unsuccessful bids from Germany and Japan were judged to be “high quality”. Invariably, when major projects go awry the possibility of pulling the pin is invoked. Taking an “off ramp” now would burn hundreds of millions of dollars, set back the delivery date beyond the current 2035 (at the earliest) and even endanger national security. The Future Submarine Program has long been a tale of woe. As Greg Sheridan argued on Thursday, the major problem with the French subs is not technical, as many experts aver, but that they will take so long to deliver. He proposes ramping up the schedule to one a year after the first boat is built. Do we have the capacity?Naval Group must be held to the clear promises it made to skill-up our workforce and to source locally. After all, taxpayers are paying a premium for this vast enterprise, over a long time. Our companies, small, medium and large, have an opportunity to create a sustainable, deep industrial capability, beyond warfare. If they get it right, defence suppliers can even sell their wares and innovations to other nations. The danger is it will become a money pit of mammoth proportions, another example of Canberra picking losers.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Consumers first in Google probe	The Australian	More competition is needed in the closed world of online advertising The latest challenge by regulators to the abusive market powers of Google and other tech giants has consumer welfare firmly in mind. The release on Thursday of the interim report into the ad tech industry by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission is the latest act in a series of moves to challenge monopoly powers and anti-competitive behaviour in the digital world. Australia has been at the forefront of efforts to force tech giants to negotiate fair fees for good journalism they now profit from for free. Google has responded with threats to close its search operations here.
The ACCC’s ad tech investigation ups the ante in a global push to release business and consumers from the constraints of unfair trade online. As the interim report explains, exploiting market dominance, even in highly technical areas that most people do not know exist such as ad tech, has real costs for everyday consumers. In Australia, ad tech is a $3.4bn a year industry that enables the nearly instantaneous delivery of digital display advertising opportunities on news, entertainment and other websites and apps.
The ACCC says digital advertising is how consumers’ attention and data are monetised. If advertisers are forced to pay too much for digital advertising, the costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services. If publishers receive too little revenue for their advertising inventory, consumers will face a reduction in the quality and variety of online content. The ACCC has made a strong case that Google’s dominance in a vertically integrated online advertising world is unhealthy for competition. The Australian regulatory body, which has exposed how Google makes massive payments to rival Facebook to protect its dominance of the search marketplace, is working with similar bodies around the world to open up the digital market to allow fresh competition.
The ACCC says it is following recent overseas enforcement actions closely. This includes a complaint filed last month by the Texas Attorney-General on behalf of nine US states. That complaint against Google alleges the company has monopoly power and forecloses competition in US markets for the supply of ad tech services. The alleged anti-competitive conduct includes unlawful tying arrangements, exclusionary conduct, market allocation and price-fixing arrangements. The complaint alleges Google’s exclusionary conduct has foreclosed competition and harmed consumers, evidenced by the exit of rival firms and limited and declining entry rates. It also alleges the existence of an unlawful agreement between Google and Facebook and deceptive trade practices in breach of some states’ consumer protection laws.
The ad tech industry in Australia is dominated by Google, which the ACCC says has a 90 per cent share of some sectors. “Google’s acquisitions of ad tech providers and related services (including YouTube, DoubleClick, AdMob and AdMeld) have contributed to Google’s strong position in the supply of ad tech services and assisted its expansion into related markets,” the interim report says. “The ACCC considers that, due to Google’s presence across the ad tech supply chain, its strong position in the supply of certain services and the opacity of the supply chain, Google is likely to have the ability and incentive to favour its own related business interests.” The ACCC is concerned that the presence of conflicts of interest that flow from this vertical integration can result in poor outcomes for advertisers and publishers. “Google’s leading position across the entire ad tech supply chain means it has attracted conflict of interest concerns,” the report says. The ACCC has put forward a series of remedies for comment and consideration to break Google’s near monopoly. The first is to give individuals and business greater access to and control over data the tech companies hold about them. This would allow other market participants to offer services on a more equal footing. The ACCC has suggested a break-up of vertical integration to prevent data gathered in the context of supplying one service from being used in the supply of a different service. There is also potential for implementation of a common user ID to allow tracking of attribution activity in a way that protects consumers’ privacy. Just as Google has resisted demands that it pay to use quality journalism that has been funded by others, the company can be expected to resist moves to make it more accountable in the ad tech space. By working closely with other regulators, the ACCC is doing consumers a great service as it tries to ensure the digital future is not compromised through lack of competition.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Victoria’s new-found pragmatism	The Australian	More contagious variants of COVID pose quarantine challenges Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is right: “There is one case, there’s no need for people to panic. There’s no need for people to be alarmed.” It’s a refreshing, sensible response to the news on Wednesday night that a hotel quarantine worker had tested positive for COVID-19. Mr Andrews’ attitude contrasts sharply with that of his West Australian counterpart, Mark McGowan, who is set to liberate two million people from Perth and surrounding areas after five days of hard lockdown at 6pm on Friday. The WA lockdown was imposed on Sunday after a hotel security guard was infected with a single case of the UK variant of the virus. On Thursday, Perth recorded a fourth straight day of no new cases but the lockdown was not cut short. It has added to the burdens of a city battling the effects of nearby destructive bushfires. True to his heavy-handed approach, Mr McGowan is retaining the rule that Victorians entering WA spend 14 days in quarantine: “I acknowledge this will cause inconvenience and frustration for many people,” he said. “But we are in a high-risk situation and we need to be cautious.” And alarmist, based on a single case. At this rate he will soon be doling out advice to Mr Andrews, as he did to NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, to stop playing “whack-a-mole” and to “crush and kill” the virus.
Mr Andrews’ current approach is a marked improvement from his disproportionate responses during Melbourne’s second coronavirus wave last year. In September, for example, he defended the city’s oppressive curfew on the grounds his government was “free to go beyond” the medical advice it received. This week he has little choice but to be more reasonable. His government is heavily invested in the Australian Open, welcoming hundreds of tennis players, coaches and officials, some from overseas hotspots. At the same time, for no good reason, Victoria’s ludicrous “traffic light” permit system shut out families and individuals from their home state, leaving many Victorians indignant.
Like Sydneysiders during the northern beaches COVID-19 outbreak in December, the overwhelming response of Melburnians on Thursday to Mr Andrews’ advice to get tested if they felt the slightest need to do so showed the public is eminently capable of co-operating without heavy-handed lockdowns. Three-hour queues at some of Melbourne’s testing centres showed the public’s fear of the pandemic as well as their willingness to play their part to protect themselves, their families and the community.
At this stage it makes sense that the Australian Open starts on Monday as scheduled. The draw has been postponed until 6pm Friday to allow for the testing and results of 507 people associated with the tournament, including 160 players. While Mr Andrews generally brushed aside economic arguments for a more balanced approach during Victoria’s protracted lockdown last year, he marshalled them yesterday in defence of holding the Open. His government’s goal was to “try and find that COVID normal, to try to have economic activity, trying to have that economic rebuilding and recovery, and manage this risk”. His push “to manage contagion risks rather than eliminate them completely” is in line with the effective pragmatic approach of NSW and at odds with Mr McGowan’s goal that “we need to eliminate the virus from Australia”. While Australian citizens continue to return home from overseas, as they must be entitled to do, that is unrealistic.
A vast effort swung into place in Victoria on Thursday morning. From Kilmore 60km north of Melbourne to Keysborough in the city’s southeast, thousands of contacts linked to the 26-year-old quarantine hotel worker were isolating and being tested. The Andrews government evidently has greater confidence in its contact-tracing system than in the past. While hundreds or perhaps thousands of people will be inconvenienced by the need to isolate at home, as Mr Andrews said, the system meant “not having to put in place rules that affected millions more”. That is a significant step forward compared with the draconian, economically destructive measures enforced last year. Provided vaccine programs fulfil their promise, such dilemmas should become increasingly academic in coming months. But in view of more virulent strains of the virus emerging, a fresh debate has opened over whether hotel quarantining should be replaced with different arrangements. As Scott Morrison says, the issue should be kept in perspective. Of 211,500 Australians who have returned since March, only a handful of cases have not been contained.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Phonics trend will help reading	The Australian	More schools are acting in the interests of Year 1 children The value of phonics (linking the sounds of letters to read words) to teach reading has been proven repeatedly in Australian and international research. Despite the entrenched opposition of teachers’ unions and some academics, it is encouraging that more than 1000 schools across the nation have voluntarily signed up to a new federal-sponsored phonics screening check for Year 1 children. The Morrison government developed the initiative after its efforts to convince states and territories to introduce system-wide phonics screening drew a cool response from some. The modest $10m invested in the program was well spent.
Only South Australia, so far, has introduced the program in all state schools. Since 2018, the proportion of Year 1 students achieving the required benchmark has improved from 43 per cent to 63 per cent. NSW and Tasmania are trialling the checks in some schools.
To their credit, almost one in four primary schools in Victoria — state, Catholic and independent — have taken matters into their own hands and signed up. So have 194 schools in WA and 204 Queensland schools, Rebecca Urban reports on Monday. As MultiLit strategy director Jennifer Buckingham, who consulted to South Australia in the lead-up to its trial of the screening check, said, the trenchant and irrational opposition of teachers’ unions and some professional associations to the Year 1 phonics check does not represent the views of a large number of teachers in classrooms. The turnaround is welcome, with schools finding that phonics is improving students’ reading.
Today’s Year 1 children should grow up to enjoy a vast range of ­career opportunities, demanding skills far beyond the “basics’’ tested in the National Assessment Program — Literacy and Numeracy. But the “basics’’ are the building blocks of further learning. The decline in Australia’s performances in international education rankings is alarming. Eleven months ago, we had our worst showing in the Program for International Student Assessment test, with 15-year-olds doing significantly worse in reading, maths and science than a decade ago. It is intolerable that too many young Australians are entering adulthood handicapped by poor literacy skills. Their economic opportunities and quality of life are on the line. Phonics has been demonstrated to make a positive difference. Even if recalcitrant states do not mandate it, more schools with their students’ interests at heart should act of their own volition.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Putin is the real prisoner of fear	The Australian	More than pro forma diplomatic denunciations by the international community are required in response to the outrageous 3½-year prison sentence imposed on leading Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny. It would be hard to imagine a more farcical judicial process or one that better sums up Vladimir Putin’s corrupt authoritarian regime. Incredibly, Mr Navalny was found guilty of breaching existing bail conditions relating to a previous conviction when, in a coma and near death, he was evacuated to Germany for medical treatment last August following his poisoning with the Soviet-era nerve agent novichok. How Mr Navalny was supposed to maintain contact with parole officers as he battled to stay alive was not explained. But nobody really doubts the trumped-up nature of the charges brought against him.
As Mr Navalny told the court, “The main thing in this whole trial isn’t what happens to me. Locking me up isn’t difficult. What matters most is why this is happening. This is happening to intimidate large numbers of people. They’re imprisoning one person to frighten millions … (but) I very much hope people will not look at this trial as a signal that they should be more afraid. This isn’t a demonstration of strength (by Mr Putin) — it’s a show of weakness.” This is a test of the resolve and strategic craft of the new Biden administration in the US. Foreign Minister Marise Payne has rightly expressed Australia’s “deep concern” about the treatment and detention of peaceful protesters and journalists in Russia, and her American counterpart, Antony Blinken, has promised the US “will co-ordinate closely with our allies and partners to hold Russia accountable for failing to uphold the rights of its citizens”. Perhaps the most effective approach would be a co-ordinated attempt to target Mr Putin’s vast personal wealth, much of it in Western banks, as well as that of his cronies. A price has to be paid for a perverse court ruling that imprisons a brave opposition leader who has survived a suspected assassination attempt when the culprits are not held to account.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Alleged war crimes set out on ADF’s day of reckoning	The Australian	Most Diggers sent to Afghanistan served with honour Thursday was a grim day in the history of Australia, and of our army. After years of investigations, internal reviews and leaks, the gruesome allegations of war crimes finally were ventilated for the nation to see. The bare metrics are horrific and tell a sorry tale. Australian soldiers are alleged to have murdered 39 Afghan civilians without compunction. At least 19 Australian soldiers will be investigated and probably will face criminal prosecution for murdering innocent civilians or prisoners of war. Chief of the Defence Force Angus Campbell was visibly affected as he delivered the litany of alleged war crimes to the nation. Their gravity cannot be overstated.
The report alleges the executions of innocent farmers and two adolescent boys were tragedies for their families. General Campbell appropriately expressed his shame and his condolences to them. Likewise, the alleged execution of compliant prisoners, incapable of resistance and posing no threat to their captors, offends the core ethos of our army. That ethos is part of our national identity. The legend of the Digger constitutes a central narrative as to who we are as a nation. Many people intuitively associate the birth of the modern Australian commonwealth with Anzac Day, more so than Federation or Australia Day. The exploits of the Anzacs who waded ashore under heavy fire at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, are commemorated with reverence each year. Every Australian soldier should be aware that they are custodians of that legacy. It demands of them the highest standards of courage, integrity and decency. As Scott Morrison and General Campbell made clear, most of the 26,000 Australian servicemen and women who deployed to Afghanistan lived up to those ideals. Some paid the supreme sacrifice, leaving grieving loved ones. The crimes of the few are as much an affront to our fallen as they are to their victims.
Thursday marked the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end. General Campbell is to be commended for facing intense questioning and pledging to spare no one in the pursuit of those whose actions have brought odium on one of the few institutions in which Australians still repose some trust. He made it clear that there had been failures in command and leadership. We welcome this unequivocally. As Ben Packham wrote on Wednesday, the morale of many decent special forces soldiers has been corroded by a process that appeared likely to prosecute a handful of frontline troops while failing to rebuke or even investigate many in the higher echelons who should have known of the alleged flagrant breaches by their men at the time they occurred. We take General Campbell at his word that officers right up the chain of command will be required to account for their behaviour, including omissions or duplicitous reporting. By issuing immediate orders that the Chief of Army remove 2 Squadron SASR from the army’s order of battle and by stripping Meritorious Unit Citations from the Special Operations Task Groups that deployed between 2007 and 2013, the CDF showed he is prepared to mete out serious collective punishments that inflict disgrace on those units. Those punishments will endure into posterity. Historic failure warrants enduring shame.
The removal of 2 Squadron from the order of battle falls short of calls for the disbandment of the SAS Regiment. We have cautioned against destroying a crucial national capability over the actions, however heinous, of a minority. The SAS is a vital clandestine capability. It has been refined into that level of professionalism by years of investment in sophisticated capabilities, especially modes of insertion into the battle space. It would be folly to throw the baby out with the bathwater, as Peter Cosgrove, a highly decorated veteran and former defence chief and governor-general, has warned.
But Justice Paul Brereton’s report stretches credulity in dismissing the high tempo of operations and repeated rotations into a dangerous environment as a factor in eroding the troops’ moral sensibilities. There is unanimity among veterans and defence experts that the absence of any coherent national strategy or clear war aims, combined with the repeated rotation of a small elite force, was a significant factor in the loss of discretion in the application of violence.
Nor do we believe the term “warrior ethos” should be disparaged. Inculcation of warrior ethos is vital in forming soldiers to engage in close combat. Criminality is not the inevitable outgrowth of warrior ethos. It occurs when commanders fail. And General Campbell has conceded numerous failures in command. Those who have failed or engaged in false reporting should be stripped of honours and, if warranted, discharged from the army. Let criminal prosecutions be pursued without delay. The cloud over the accused soldiers has lingered long enough. Justice delayed is justice denied. This process cannot be permitted to drag on and cripple the combat effectiveness of the entire Special Operations Command. This day of shame will not be redeemed by hiring cultural change experts and woke consultants who do not understand the core business of a combat unit. General Campbell has demonstrated he is willing to take drastic measures to redeem the tarnished reputation of our special forces and the wider ADF. His pledge to provide quarterly updates on the process he announced is welcome. The ongoing investigation of the degree of knowledge of several senior officers must continue and the cards allowed to lie where they fall. While 19 soldiers are likely to face prosecution, they are a symptom of a deeper problem. They should not bear total responsibility for the absence of any coherent political strategy and for rosy assurances delivered to the civilian leadership by ambitious commanders who failed to warn of the toll repeated deployments were taking in an unwinnable war.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Alcott’s triumph at Melbourne Park	The Australian	Most tennis fans were asleep when it happened, missing the nation’s best win at the Australian Open. But wheelchair tennis star Dylan Alcott’s capturing his seventh straight quad singles crown, beating Dutchman Sam Schroder 6-1 6-0 in the final, was a victory to savour. The match, which finally began on Margaret Court Arena at 11.15pm on Wednesday, had been scheduled for the Rod Laver Arena. But it was delayed by the Tsitsipas-Nadal epic quarter-final.
The talented and indefatigable Alcott, 30, was not fazed by competing at such an hour. “I always said I do my best work after midnight.” And he did. Tennis fans would have loved watching it live. On Tuesday, Alcott had teamed up with fellow Aussie Heath Davidson to win the quad wheelchair doubles title. They beat Brit Andy Lapthorne and American David Wagner in three sets. “I get to play tennis with one of my best mates,” Alcott said. “Not many people can say that.” It was, he said, “pretty awesome”. Not only for Alcott, who was born with a tumour wrapped around his spinal cord and initially struggled to come to terms with life as a paraplegic. His success is an inspiration for the young people who look to Alcott as a role model, through his charitable foundation. It helps young Australians with disabilities gain confidence, fulfil their potential and aim high.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Centrist pitch fails on Palestine	The Australian	Mr Albanese has worked hard to fix costly errors on domestic policy The ALP stage-managed its national conference, having learnt from its unexpected electoral defeat to Scott Morrison in 2019. But it has forgotten how Jeremy Corbyn’s anti-Semitic agenda destroyed the Labour brand in Britain. In a tightly controlled affair, the ALP declared its support for coal workers, renewable energy jobs and low-paid workers. The ALP platform, confirmed in congratulatory online contributions from hand-picked party members, was all about becoming the smallest possible target for the coming federal election. As chief political correspondent Geoff Chambers has written, Anthony Albanese’s sanitised conference was manufactured to neutralise controversy and division inside Labor. The exception was the bizarre decision to recognise a Palestinian state. On that score, the party’s authoritarian nature was on display with its decision to block former federal MP Michael Danby from speaking against it.
The electorally devastating policy to abolish franking credit refunds has been ditched, and the ALP climate change agenda announced on Wednesday was big on aspiration but short on detail. There is no short-term target, but a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050 lacks any real detail on how it might be achieved. There will be support for electric cars, which basically translates into another subsidy for rich voters at the expense of the less well-off. And after the drubbing Labor received in Queensland in 2019, a last-minute amendment put by the Australian Workers Union and the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union praises coal workers and miners for building the nation. Against the wishes of green groups, gas is acknowledged as a transitional fuel and carbon capture and storage is welcomed with a promise of more funding.
Having been caught between its inner-city and working-class constituencies, Labor is painting itself as the middle option in its pitch to party members and voters. The Morrison government is dismissed as not believing in climate change, while the Greens are blamed for starting the climate wars “when it sunk the (Rudd government’s) carbon pollution reduction scheme and doesn’t care at all about the workers and communities whose jobs are at stake”. On industrial relations, the ALP has said it will “act on wage theft” after refusing to co-operate with the government on the issue. Women will be given access to 10 days’ domestic violence leave. Labor is championing low-paid workers in the horticulture and gig sectors. In short, it was a conference for miners, pizza deliverers and electric car drivers with a healthy dose of divisive politics on the Middle East.
Mr Danby was right to describe the ALP conference’s pledge to recognise a manifestly non-existent state of Palestine as “bizarre”. The party compounded its misjudgment by outrageously preventing Mr Danby, a widely respected and influential figure in both ALP and Jewish circles, from addressing the conference. The ALP under Mr Albanese clearly has not learned the lesson of his friend Mr Corbyn’s cataclysmic “worst defeat for Labour in almost 100 years” at the 2019 British election. That lesson was that pledging recognition of a phantom Palestinian state was not an election winner. As Mr Danby said, the ALP, in backing senator Penny Wong’s amendment to recognise a Palestinian state, also had adopted Mr Corbyn’s “Stalinist methods by suppressing debate on the foreign policy motions”. The ALP policy ignores the basic reality that “Palestine”, as it is currently constituted, does not come within a country mile of fulfilling the criteria for statehood set out in the 1933 Montevideo Convention for the Rights and Duties of States, which is accepted as the minimum de facto requirement in international law for recognition. “Palestine” has neither fixed nor internationally accepted borders. It does not fulfil another of the essential criteria — a single, centralised government that has the capacity to enter into relations with other states. Instead, there is a deep divide and frequently serious armed conflict between Palestinian factions, especially involving the terrorist movement Hamas in Gaza with its hardline Islamist fundamentalism and intolerance of personal freedom. As the ALP has worked hard to repair its electorally costly mistakes on domestic policy, Mr Albanese would be wise to remember the international lessons as well.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Revisit Covid modelling to open Victorian economy	The Australian	Mr Andrews needs a circuit breaker to kick-start the state The Andrews government’s $3bn support package in cash grants and tax relief, and deferrals for Victorian businesses crippled by the coronavirus lockdown, is a modest lifeline. It comes in the depths of an economic lockdown the federal Treasury believes is costing about $1bn a week. As Scott Morrison said on Sunday, the package announced by Premier Daniel Andrews is consistent with Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe’s advice to national cabinet that the states should provide additional economic support in response to the fallout from the COVID crisis. But, while it will help business bottom lines, what they really need now is the chance to open up and operate. For some small businesses it is too late. They are closed for good as Graeme Samuel, former chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says: “And there is the flow-on effect up the line to suppliers and manufacturers’’.
Under the package, payroll tax for businesses with payrolls up to $10m will be deferred for the 2020-21 financial year, providing a $1.7bn “cashflow boost’’. Not unreasonably, Australian Industry Group Victorian director Tim Piper said the decision not to waive payroll tax payments for this year was “extremely” disappointing. The companies liable to repay the amount being deferred, after all, have not been allowed to trade for much of the year.
With COVID-19 case numbers falling, Mr Andrews has an opportunity to bring forward reopening of the state’s economy, safely. As Simon Benson revealed on Saturday, world-leading scientists linked to modelling used by Mr Andrews to lock down Melbourne say the research has been misrepresented. They have urged the Premier to re-run their model with more realistic data that could allow restrictions to be lifted earlier. Current suppression targets, the scientists argue, are more ambitious than those of major European, US and Asian cities — with the exception of Wuhan, which barred almost all movement and work. As a starting point, Mr Andrews should also give Melbourne’s 9pm-5am curfew the boot. State Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton and Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton made clear last week that the curfew was not based on either medical or police advice. And a coalition of major companies, led by BHP, Wesfarmers and biotech giant CSL (which is developing two potential vaccines), warn the curfew will cause irreparable damage to the community and the economy. The business leaders, employing more than 200,000 workers, also called for an urgent revision of the pandemic modelling and recovery road map. The suggestion by Professor Samuel that the Productivity Commission review the modelling and Victoria’s “road map’’ would be worth acting upon. Mr Andrews should release the full modelling, in the interests of transparency. As Health Minister Greg Hunt says, revisiting the modelling using achievable targets and improvements in contact tracing would serve as a circuit breaker that would help improve mental health and social and economic wellbeing. Mr Andrews has deemed any revision of the road map unlikely; he should think again.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
No apology for shameless spin	The Australian	Mr Andrews’ claim to ‘higher standards’ does not bear scrutiny
Daniel Andrews’ political hide, thick as a rhinoceros skin, was on show on Tuesday when he claimed Victoria’s “higher standards” of hotel quarantining as an excuse for limiting the increase in the state’s cap on international arrivals to only 15 per cent. NSW and Queensland, in contrast, are doubling their intakes of international passengers — mainly Australians coming home from living overseas — from Monday. Allowing our citizens to return is part of the nation’s return to normality. Mr Andrews mentioned several of what he said were “about 50” improvements to Victoria’s quarantine program. It needed vast improvement after last year’s tragic debacles that led to more than 20,000 community infections and 801 deaths in the state. Changes since then include overhauling airconditioning systems, ripping up carpets, putting down lino, cleaning “to industrial standards” and having staff COVID-tested on their days off, as well as every day at work.
Mr Andrews’ pitch did not pass muster, however, especially on a day when two more positive cases were linked to the Holiday Inn Melbourne Airport. They brought the total number of transmissions identified in the program in less than a week to five across three hotels. The new cases were a returned traveller and a food and beverage worker. Two new overseas-acquired COVID-19 cases were reported in NSW, which is taking half the nation’s quota of returned travellers. Asked how he could claim Victoria had “higher standards”, Mr Andrews brazened it out: “Well, I can say it because it’s true. And whether that’s convenient for people or not is not really my concern.” His real concern is politics. While NSW is doubling its weekly quota of international arrivals to 3010 people, Victoria will lift its intake from next week from 1120 to just 1310 people. Ever insular and self-serving, West Australian Premier Mark McGowan is keeping WA’s total at 512 for now as an “extra precaution”.
So far, fortunately, the UK and South African variants of COVID-19 have not triggered community outbreaks in Australia. But constant hand-wringing by commentators and politicians claiming that newer variants of the virus are “highly contagious” and “superspreaders” are being widely accepted at face value. That is making it easier for Mr Andrews, never one to waste a good crisis, to get away with smug claims like: “We’re not going to go anywhere near the capacity that NSW has, or other states have, and I don’t make any apology for that. We will have less capacity because we have a different model and I lead higher standards.” That view is highly contestable.
The commonwealth is responsible for quarantine under the Constitution, as opponents of the government like to point out. On Tuesday, Labor frontbencher Kristina Keneally claimed Scott Morrison had got away with a “vanishing act” during COVID-19 by “pulling the wool” over Australians’ eyes and putting “risk management” of quarantining on to premiers. Senator Keneally is wrong on that score, as are vocal critics on social media echoing the same criticism. Mr Andrews corrected the misapprehensions on Tuesday when he said: “I see some commentary today about ‘hotels aren’t the go and all that’. Well, that’s not the decision of national cabinet.” In March last year, national cabinet agreed that all travellers arriving in Australia would undertake mandatory 14-day self-isolation at designated facilities such as hotels. Those facilities would be determined by the states and normally would be in the city the traveller had cleared immigration. The requirements would be implemented under state legislation and enforced by state governments, with the support of the Australian Defence Force and Australian Border Force. Subsequent events proved the standards of quarantine and its oversight can be the difference between isolated COVID hotspots and widespread deadly outbreaks. Of late, Australia has done well. But Mr Andrews, of all people, should know the virus is too serious an issue to be misused in a stupid game of political one-upmanship.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
A labour movement divided	The Australian	Mr Fitzgibbon’s move will unsettle Labor’s traditional base Joel Fitzgibbon’s resignation from the opposition frontbench has delivered more than a shot across Anthony Albanese’s bow. It is a damaging blow to Mr Albanese’s leadership and Labor’s credibility. Actions speak louder than words and Mr Fitzgibbon’s mouthing of the usual pieties as to his leader’s electability may be discounted. They were the polite formulations of a man who has no confidence in the Opposition Leader to drag his party back to middle ground. Mr Fitzgibbon nearly lost his seat of Hunter in NSW last year. He narrowly fended off a challenge from a One Nation candidate in an electorate populated by miners and others whose livelihoods depend on coal. He learned key lessons.
Despite Mr Albanese’s claims that he has absorbed the lessons of Bill Shorten’s defeat, he does not appear to have heeded them. His ill-judged attempt to exploit the election of Joe Biden in the US on a platform of carbon emissions reduction was a case in point. His question time assault on Monday and the bizarre demand that Scott Morrison directly intervene to persuade Donald Trump to concede to his rival apparently were the last straws. Mr Fitzgibbon has made a calculated decision that his best chance of holding his seat is to distance himself from his leader and the frontbench. Perhaps ominously for Mr Albanese, Mr Fitzgibbon was half-hearted in ruling out his own tilt at the leadership. In the formulaic language that precedes every spill, he pledged: “I have no intention of running for the leadership. I would have to be drafted.” His confidence that Mr Albanese could win the next election came with the heavy qualification: “I think Albo can win if he listens to Joel Fitzgibbon.” Few would consider Mr Fitzgibbon foreman material. But Mr Albanese will ignore the substance of his warning at his peril. Before her re-election, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk jettisoned her left-wing deputy, Jackie Trad, and her government's opposition to the Adani coalmine in the aftermath of the state’s resounding endorsement of the Prime Minister in May last year. Australia has never withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, so Mr Albanese’s ham-fisted attempt to ensnare Mr Morrison in the fallout from the US result was poor judgment. The US election was decided on the coronavirus pandemic and polarised attitudes to Mr Trump on a range of issues. As Mr Fitzgibbon said, for his leader and Labor left colleagues Mark Butler, Pat Conroy and Andrew Giles to draw solace from the American result was “delusional”.
Unlike most of the opposition leadership team, Mr Fitzgibbon was a tradesman before he succeeded his father, Eric, as the member for Hunter. Both men understood their constituents’ concerns. Neither was born into privilege. Like maverick Nationals MP George Christensen, Mr Fitzgibbon represents more miners than Mr Albanese and opposition education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek combined. Wednesday is the 45th anniversary of the Dismissal of the Whitlam government. While some true believers maintain the rage, the real significance of the Whitlam era was its transformation of Labor into a party of the intelligentsia and what US social critic Christopher Lasch described as “the symbolic professions”. Can anyone in modern Labor imagine a small-town cop such as Bill Hayden, who appears in this newspaper on Wednesday, ascending to the leadership of the party now? Even the impeccably dressed Paul Keating sold suits before he became famous for his sartorial elegance. He did not attend university. As it marks the Dismissal, Labor would do well to revisit its past empathy for the aspirations and concerns of miners, farmers and others for whom the green left reserves lofty condescension. Such Australians, like tradespeople and small-business entrepreneurs, will be the beating heart of economic recovery after the pandemic. Australia has met its emissions reduction targets to date. There is more risk for Mr Albanese than for Mr Morrison in resuming the energy and climate wars. Mr Fitzgibbon’s move to the backbench is a sign of a party riven by doubts about what it believes and who it represents. Mr Albanese should hope the member for Hunter does not maintain his rage.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Business must not dictate the nation’s foreign policy	The Australian	Mr Forrest is wrong — this important issue is not a beat-up
What a PR coup — for the Chinese Communist Party. In helping Long Zhou, China’s consul-general in Melbourne, gatecrash a federal government press conference on Wednesday, blindsiding a stony-faced Health Minister Greg Hunt, billionaire Andrew Forrest will not have done his business interests any harm. As Fortescue chief executive Elizabeth Gaines said on Thursday, the company “is a core supplier of iron ore to China … and (we) anticipate a steady recovery in economic activity in that market”. Mr Forrest tried to play it down on Thursday. Grinning from ear to ear on breakfast television, he claimed to be “the most Australian person I know. I run the oranges out to the game for Australia, not China or America … take a chill pill”. It won’t wash.
When relations between countries are frayed it is “a pretty basic expectation”, as Victorian Liberal MP Tim Wilson says, for Australians to be loyal and back their own, not to provide a platform for a foreign spokesman. Hours before the ambush, Mr Forrest was busy complaining about the proposed timing of the Morrison government’s inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, suggesting it would help Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. Such policy matters, frankly, are not Mr Forrest’s business. His attempts to brush off the press conference incident as a “beat-up” suggest it was a stunt — and one worthy of Clive Palmer at that. Mr Forrest normally conducts his philanthropic endeavours at top level, winning support from the political establishment. Not so on Thursday when a joint press conference between him and Mr Hunt in support of children’s cancer research was cancelled at short notice.
In wading into the Australia-China relationship Mr Forrest is on dangerous ground. Dennis Richardson, who headed ASIO and the departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade, warns that business leaders running Beijing’s line in opposing a global probe into the origins of COVID-19 could “potentially” undercut Australia’s foreign policy. Someone as experienced and sophisticated as Mr Forrest should understand why. If he does but pressed ahead handing Mr Long a podium anyway, it was all the more inexcusable.
Speaking on behalf of Chinese ambassador Cheng Jingye, Mr Long delivered China’s propaganda spiel, giving the central politburo in Beijing ample footage to splay around its state-controlled media. “As it’s known throughout China has attached great importance to international health co-operation,” Mr Long said. Really? Mr Cheng was so angered by Scott Morrison’s calls for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 that he has threatened trade and tourism boycotts. Australia will not be bullied by “an ambassador who’s gone rogue in Canberra”, as former foreign minister Alexander Downer says.
Unabashed to be taking the microphone, Mr Long also claimed China had “released information related to the COVID-19 in (an) open, transparent and responsible manner, and we have worked closely with WHO and other countries, including sharing experiences in epidemic prevention and control and providing assistance within our capacity”. Hardly. As late as January, Beijing claimed there were no human-to-human infections, despite urging its overseas companies to ship home medical supplies urgently. Chinese medical whistleblowers were punished for speaking up before their government admitted what was wrong.The Australian welcomes the success of companies selling iron ore around the world. We also support overseas investment in Australia, where it serves the national interest. Our nation needs to be pragmatic and cautious in its complex relationship with China, as John Howard says. Australian Strategic Policy Institute executive director Peter Jennings is correct when he points out the government is aware of issues that business leaders are not. These issues include the problems of Chinese cyber interference and intelligence gathering and military actions threatening countries from Taiwan down to the South China Sea. After more than three million COVID-19 cases and 220,000 deaths, Mr Forrest has shown business and diplomacy do not always mix. The national interest is ultimately in the interest of Australian businesses. If Mr Forrest wants to change policy he should stand for parliament.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Time will judge Biden’s global leadership goals	The Australian	Mr Kerry’s appointment panders to the Democrat left flank Donald Trump was always unlikely to be gracious in defeat. But his grudging willingness to allow the machinery of government to begin the transition process in Washington is recognition at last of reality. US president-elect Joe Biden has wasted no time in naming key members of his administration. Doing so is imperative, despite Mr Trump’s insistence on Twitter (where else?) that “I concede NOTHING!!!”. But with Mr Trump’s dozens of chaotic legal challenges going nowhere, it is time to get on with the normal processes involved in the democratic handover of power to an incoming president.
“America is back” and “ready to lead”, Mr Biden said in announcing the major appointments. As Cameron Stewart reported, they show how much the new administration plans to distance itself from Mr Trump’s more isolationist “America first” approach to foreign policy. Many, including major US allies such as Germany that have had an unhappy relationship with Mr Trump, will cheer the appointment of mainstream internationalists Antony Blinken as secretary of state and Jake Sullivan as Mr Biden’s national security adviser. Writing in Foreign Affairs magazine, Mr Trump’s former defence secretary, Jim Mattis, likened his one-time boss’s neglect of US allies to allowing a long-tended garden to become choked with weeds: “In practice, America first (has) meant America alone.” Like other appointments announced by Mr Biden, including the widely admired Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary, Mr Blinken and Mr Sullivan are alumni of the Obama administration. Committed centrists, they were on the more hawkish side of Obama-era policy debates. Mr Blinken, whose stepfather, a Holocaust survivor, was brought up in Melbourne, is a strong supporter of Israel and favoured the 2002 Iraq war and US intervention in Libya. Mr Sullivan supported sending US missiles to Ukraine, a policy Barack Obama opposed.
Together with the expected appointment of the vastly experienced Michele Flournoy as defence secretary, they are expected to form a team that should stand up to adversaries better than Mr Obama did. Such optimism must be tempered, however, by Mr Biden’s appointment of his close friend, former Obama secretary of state John Kerry, as climate tsar with responsibility to reverse Mr Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.
Mr Kerry’s role in negotiating the deeply flawed Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Agreement showed his inability to nail a hard bargain. In his new role he will be a member of the National Security Council, the new president’s principal national security and foreign policy forum. Mr Biden regards climate change as a critical national security issue. The president-elect may be hoping to appease the Democratic Party’s far left, which underpinned the disparate coalition that backed his nomination. But given Mr Kerry’s record, Mr Biden should be cautious. His administration will get off to a bad start if it pursues the same policies that helped Mr Trump win in 2016 and poll well on November 3. The fracking-led boom in US oil and gas production has enhanced US security. It is no longer dependent on foreign producers and its economy is less a hostage to world oil markets.
Mr Biden’s team will want to return the US to the Iran nuclear deal. But it must not do so in the form negotiated by Mr Kerry. European signatories have stuck with the deal, but Mr Biden must not repeat the mistakes Mr Kerry made in giving away far too much to the ayatollahs. Mr Trump leaves a legacy of strength and solid achievement in the Middle East that will be at risk if Mr Biden tries to cosy up to Tehran again. But it is with China that Mr Biden’s team will face its hardest immediate challenge. Despite the strength Mr Trump showed Beijing over trade, his difficult relations with some US allies, especially in Europe, meant he was unable to forge an effective alliance of nations to dissuade China from its aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific. Mr Kerry will have a crucial role dealing with China over the Paris Agreement, which allows Beijing not to reduce carbon emissions at all until 2030. Wall Street Journal columnist Walter Russell Mead fears that sending Mr Kerry to negotiate with Chinese President Xi Jinping on climate “is a recipe for (him) returning home dressed in a barrel”. At least, however, US foreign policy under Mr Biden appears likely to continue shifting towards the Indo-Pacific.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
WA must be on Team Australia	The Australian	Mr McGowan’s attitude has fostered separatist sentiments Following last week’s inconclusive national cabinet meeting, Scott Morrison ruefully remarked “at times it has felt like Australia could fall apart”. Throughout the dual health and economic crises that have afflicted Australians this year, the Prime Minister has attempted to maintain a coherent national approach to containing the COVID -19 pandemic while maintaining the heartbeat of our economy. Until recently, his tone has been magnanimous. He has placed pragmatism above politicking. But his conciliatory approach, sadly for our beleaguered nation, has been spurned by delinquent premiers.
Whether through the incompetence and obfuscation of Daniel Andrews in Victoria or the brazen parochialism of Annastacia Palaszczuk in Queensland, the national interest has been relegated to second place behind the political imperatives of state leaders. The national economy has been crippled, with the retail and tourism sectors bearing the brunt. Yet the national government funds vital income and business support measures.
Most culpable among this cluster of militant mediocrities is Mark McGowan of Western Australia. He is enjoying phenomenal personal approval ratings and the adulation of fawning local media. Yet it is unlikely history will be kind to him. Despite being an adoptive West Australian, he grasps that his state has always nurtured a deep sense of separation from the eastern states. Western Australia came late to the Federation in 1901. It even flirted with secession in 1933. Votes are easily harvested among West Australians who believe they give more to the great project of Australian nationhood than receive in return. That misplaced sense of grievance lurks beneath the surface of WA politics. Leaders of genuine stature do not fan its flames for spurious advantage. They know the one indissoluble commonwealth was founded to provide for mutual security of the colonies. The case for Federation remains as strong today as it was in 1901. Imagine Australia without the wartime leadership of John Curtin. Imagine an independent, sparsely populated West Australian nation fending off Japanese attacks unassisted in those dark days of 1942-43, when air raids struck Broome.
Mr McGowan is happy to flout section 92 of the Constitution, regarding absolute freedom of intercourse among the states. Is he willing to repudiate section 114 of the same instrument and raise his own naval and military forces? Presumably they could be funded out of the disproportionate wealth he claims to be donating to the rest of the nation. Panic about Soviet incursions into the Indian Ocean during the Cold War led to a permanent naval presence on the west coast. Vital air force and army components also are based there. Does Mr McGowan want these to be moved? Like Mr McGowan, Bob Hawke, adopted Western Australia as his home. He was elected on a promise of “Bringing Australia Together”. He vies with Curtin as Labor’s greatest leader. Mr McGowan is unworthy of their legacy. Certainly, Australia needs Western Australia. Despite his adolescent posturing, Mr McGowan knows his state needs Australia more than the rest of the nation needs it, though fragmentation would be a calamity for all. It is time for Mr McGowan to repudiate the nonsense being spouted among separatists. He has created the climate in which this poisonous sentiment has flourished.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Andrews set for power grab as Covid cases fall	The Australian	Mr Morrison’s goal of open borders by Christmas is spot-on Victorians who are at the end of their tether and their finances after months of restrictive government by executive decree and daily press conferences can brace themselves for more of the same. For that they can thank the Greens, the Reason Party’s Fiona Patten and the Animal Justice Party’s Andy Meddick, whose support will allow Premier Daniel Andrews to extend his state of emergency for six months. In his thirst for power and his distaste for accountability, he wanted another 12 months. As news of the crossbenchers’ cave-in emerged on Tuesday, the number of new COVID-19 cases in Victoria fell to 70 (down from 397 cases a month ago), with five deaths. If that positive trend continues the daily total of new cases might be comparable to that of NSW, which had 13 new cases on Tuesday, or in single digits by September 13 when the stage-four lockdown and absurd 8pm curfew are scheduled to end in Melbourne.
As Josh Frydenberg says, Mr Andrews and his government need to be “talking more about the road out than about a longer road in”. Where Victorians are allowed to go from here will be revealed on Sunday, when Mr Andrews will produce two road maps — one for opening up Melbourne and the other for the rest of the state. Details of the plans are still sketchy. They will need to take on board the advice of different sectors the Andrews government has been consulting, including: construction; manufacturing; professional services; transport and freight; retailing food and groceries; agriculture; sport and tourism; hospitality; arts and cultural organisations; and community groups. The Premier also should consider the advice of a coterie of medical specialists who warned on Tuesday about the serious physical and mental health consequences arising from 23-hour-a-day lockdowns, isolation, loneliness and patients’ fear of attending medical appointments and seeking treatment, which is worsening prognoses for some cancer patients. The Australian Medical Association has likened Victoria’s handling of the pandemic to witnessing a “slow car crash” unfold.
The best principle for governments to follow in winding back restrictions would be to move to a back seat and allow as many areas of life as possible, especially commercial activity, to resume while ensuring sensible health precautions. That proviso remains vital. It is also the reason — however stifling their cabin fever or how intense their anger over government incompetence and its costs — Victorians planning to attend the anti-lockdown protest on Saturday in Melbourne should stay home. Those urging objectors to take to the streets are irresponsible. As well as risking a spike in COVID case numbers and putting vulnerable lives at risk, a large turnout would give authorities grounds to hold the reins tighter on easing restrictions, at immense cost to the economy of our second largest state. The lockdown is costing Victoria as much as $400m a day. Scott Morrison, Mr Andrews and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian are on the right track in discussing plans to relax the NSW-Victorian border for the benefit of border communities struggling with closures, despite having little or no coronavirus in their areas. Victoria and NSW, to their credit, are prepared to reopen their border as soon as it is safe. In the Coalition partyroom on Tuesday, the federal Treasurer invoked John Howard, reminding colleagues that the former prime minister had little time for parochialism and said in a speech 15 years ago that the federation was there to serve the lives of all Australians. But even with the new system of COVID hotspots to be produced on Friday to encourage premiers to open up borders safely, the Prime Minister will need to move mountains at national cabinet to elicit more co-operative attitudes from Queensland and Western Australia. But at least, after the tragic death of an unborn twin baby, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has taken the incremental step of creating a new border exemption unit to deal with “distressing” cases of northern NSW patients denied medical care in Queensland. But Mr Morrison’s vision for the way ahead is correct: “What we have to work to do is to let Australians know that, by Christmas, they will be able to come together. By Christmas, they will be able to come together as families and look to a 2021 that doesn’t look like the difficulties that they’ve gone through in 2020.”	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Advancing regional interests	The Australian	Mr Morrison’s visit to Japan is strategically significant Scott Morrison’s visit to Japan this week to confer with new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is indicative of the strength of the bilateral relationship. Mr Morrison will be the first foreign leader to meet Mr Suga in Tokyo since he succeeded Shinzo Abe in September, an honour in the lexicon of international diplomatic gestures. It will also be the Prime Minister’s first official overseas trip since the pandemic. Choosing Tokyo underlines the importance he attaches to our ties with Japan. He is right to do so. Japanese media has reported that Mr Morrison and Mr Suga are set to conclude a mutual defence pact as a major new bulwark against Beijing’s regional military assertiveness.
On Sunday, Australia and Japan were among 15 nations — including China, crucially — to join the vast new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world’s biggest single trading bloc covering 30 per cent of the global population and 30 per cent of global GDP. China played a pivotal role in establishing the RCEP as an alternative to the Trans-Pacific Partnership from which Donald Trump unwisely withdrew the US in his first week in the White House.
Formation of the RCEP, Amanda Hodge reported on Saturday, delivers “a foreign policy triumph for Beijing” amid its ongoing trade war with the US. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham says its formation “signifies our region … the most economically dynamic region in the world in recent decades, is still committed to openness”. He hopes the partnership will draw China back into multilateral negotiations aimed at ending the trade disputes that have damaged Australian industry and threatened $20bn of our exports. But as John Howard has advised Mr Morrison, repairing the relationship with Beijing is best done at leadership level. In an interview with Asialink at the University of Melbourne, Mr Howard urged Mr Morrison to seek a face-to-face meeting with President Xi Jinping. This has been difficult with virtual summits replacing normal meetings during the pandemic. Political turmoil in PNG caused the postponement of Mr Morrison’s visit. But Australia is right in supporting our northern neighbour with the rollover of an existing $442m loan. Australia is also providing a substantial financial rescue package to boost the viability of Pacific island airlines post-COVID. Such largesse underpins vital security interests. As a medium power, we have the capacity to make a tangible difference in the Southwest Pacific and Micronesia. We cannot afford a cluster of failed states in our neighbourhood, straddling vital sea lines of communication. Permanent basing of naval forces of hostile powers in any of these nations would be of serious concern. In the lexicon of Defence white papers and strategic updates, these nations are our “inner arc” or the “archipelagic approaches” to Australia. Their sovereignty and solvency matter to us. The size and scope of the current assistance is generous to our friends in their hour of need, rather than Beijing-style debt-trap diplomacy. It is also significant that the assistance is being provided from Treasury rather than Export Finance Australia, a clear signal the rescue package represents a serious whole-of-government approach to supporting neighbours such as PNG, Vanuatu, Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Micronesia. This rescue package is the right thing to do and is being done well.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
An Israeli government at last	The Australian	Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz must honour their deal
After a damaging year of political stasis and three inconclusive elections, Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz gave coronavirus as the reason he finally buckled and agreed to form a national unity government with Benjamin Netanyahu. Explaining his spectacular backflip, after trenchantly insisting he would never join an administration led by Mr Netanyahu, the former army commander said: “These are unusual times and they call for unusual decisions.” He was right: the 3619 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths in Israel to date are testing what is the Middle East’s finest medical system. As good as it is, however, there is potential for catastrophe with COVID-19 in Gaza, where 2 million people are crammed together cheek by jowl with few hygiene services. At this stage, the Palestinian territory has reported just 98 cases and one death.
While coronavirus may have been the immediate reason Mr Gantz teamed up with Mr Netanyahu, other issues are in urgent need of resolution after a year of caretaker government with Mr Netanyahu acting prime minister. Without a fully fledged government, Israel has not been able to pass military budgets needed for arms procurement and infrastructure.
The most recent of the three elections on March 2 showed again that Israel was divided down the middle between Mr Netanyahu’s Likud-led right-wing coalition and what was Mr Gantz’s more moderate Blue and White alliance. Neither could form government without the other. It is to Mr Gantz’s credit that he was prepared to, in effect, blow up Blue and White for the sake of the national interest.
Furious former allies in Blue and White’s shattered ranks have accused him of “crawling” to join the new national unity government in which, if all goes well, Mr Netanyahu will serve initially as prime minister for 18 months, with Mr Gantz as his deputy. Mr Gantz will then take over as prime minister in September next year.
With Mr Netanyahu under indictment and facing trial on bribery and fraud charges, it could not have been easy for Mr Gantz to agree to serve under him. But the more telling criticism that could be made of Mr Gantz is it took him so long to accept the compelling force of President Reuven Rivlin’s advice that the only way out of Israel’s protracted political impasse was a national unity government.Much has been left in abeyance during the long months of political arm-wrestling. The fact COVID-19 is racing like wildfire through Iran has also created apprehension about future actions of an unhinged, would-be nuclear nation hellbent on Israel’s destruction. It is imperative that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz set aside past differences and form the stable, broadbased government Israel has needed for so long. They must also stick scrupulously to the deal they have announced.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Navalny mobilises free spirits	The Australian	Mr Putin must pay a price if he moves to snuff out peaceful protest If Vladimir Putin believed sending Alexei Navalny back to jail would silence his most prominent critic, he got an unequivocal rebuke in the mass street protests seen in more than 100 cities across Russia on the weekend. Responding to a call from Mr Navalny in his prison cell, more than 300,000 demonstrators — from Moscow to St Petersburg (significantly Mr Putin’s home town) to Vladivostok — braved freezing temperatures, the risk of COVID-19 and threats of incarceration by thuggish security forces. The size and spread of the protests have been described as “unprecedented” during the former KGB colonel’s 21 years in power. They will add to the pressure on Mr Putin as polls show a decline in his popularity and growing public anger over yet more allegations of gross corruption.
Last August, Mr Navalny, 44, was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok, allegedly on Mr Putin’s orders, and he was evacuated to Germany. Showing immense courage, Mr Navalny returned to Moscow on January 17. He was immediately imprisoned on trumped-up charges. Most would have understood it if, having survived the assassination attempt, Mr Navalny chose to remain silent. Even in prison, however, he has not stopped fighting, his supporters further enraging Mr Putin by posting details of a gigantic “new Versailles” or “Winter Palace” costing $1.7bn being built for him on the Black Sea. The video has had more than 80 million views.
In Moscow, more than 50,000 people braved a massive police presence in Pushkin Square, a short walk from the Kremlin, to demand both Mr Navalny’s release and declare “Putin is a thief”. Ahead of parliamentary elections in September, the importance of the challenge Mr Navalny poses is difficult to overstate.
Given the regularity with which Putin critics come to grief, there will inevitably be fears for Mr Navalny’s safety. The Russian leader’s record shows no compunction when dealing ruthlessly with those who cross him. In a chilling Instagram post last Friday, Mr Navalny warned of likely fresh attempts to kill him: “Just in case: I don’t plan to hang myself on the window or cut my veins or throat open with a sharpened spoon. I use the staircase very carefully (and) they take my (blood) pressure every day so a sudden heart attack is ruled out.” The strong show of support for Mr Navalny across Russia may serve as a form of political life insurance. Western democracies, particularly Joe Biden’s new US administration, should make very clear that further brutal repression by Mr Putin’s regime will lead to exposure of the vast assets that he and his associates have salted away overseas, chiefly in the UK and US. Because of Donald Trump’s indulgent attitude towards Mr Putin, he has never been adequately punished for the 2018 Novichok poisonings in the UK and the 2014 invasion of Crimea. Mr Biden, after meeting the Russian despot in 2011, famously recalled that he looked into his eyes and “saw no soul”. That should be a good starting point for what Mr Navalny’s plight shows must be a far more determined Western approach in confronting Mr Putin’s appalling treatment of his democratic opponents.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Grassroots battle for the leadership of free world	The Australian	Mr Trump better tapped into mainstream voters’ concerns
And the winner is … grassroots US democracy; the people who express their view quietly where it matters, at the ballot box. The losers, as in 2016, are the pollsters, naive commentators who take them at face value and most of the so-called progressive Twitterati. Regardless of who prevails when the last ballots are counted or recounted — and an extraordinary 11th-hour twist has made that problematic — the red and blue chequerboard across the US is not what the elites and chattering classes predicted or wanted. The deplorables get a vote, too. Progressive ideology and empty woke symbolism took a big hit.
For months almost every poll put Democrat challenger Joe Biden 10 to 12 points ahead of President Donald Trump. In recent days pundits said the race had tightened in the battleground states, but only slightly. The contest, most insisted, was Mr Biden’s to lose; he was expected to win the popular vote, just as Hillary Clinton did against Mr Trump, by a margin of three million votes. Wiser heads, such as Cameron Stewart and Greg Sheridan, knew Mr Trump was always in striking distance and had a pathway to re-election. And on Wednesday night, amid seesawing uncertainty about who would claim the 270 electoral college votes to win, Mr Trump had more than held his own in most state races. This represents a remarkable achievement by Mr Trump after being written off by most of the hostile US media, which yet again misread the popular vote. Some even claimed Mr Biden would win in a landslide.
The first clue that pundits had got it wrong came early in the count. CNN, often at loggerheads with the Trump administration, released an exit poll that made it clear that the idea that Mr Trump was doomed to lose mainly because of his mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic was overstated. More than one in three voters emerging from the booths rated the economy their No 1 concern. As on this side of the Pacific, what mattered to them were job security, taxes, economic opportunity and cheap energy. Mr Biden’s pledge to abolish the oil and gas industries was a colossal blunder. The other issues that rated in the CNN exit poll were racial equality (21 per cent), the pandemic (18 per cent); crime and safety (11 per cent) and healthcare (11 per cent). Mr Biden over-egged COVID-19, serious as it is, and the threat he claimed Mr Trump posed to Obamacare.
Those issues reflected a Reuters survey last month in which 56 per cent of Americans, asked whether they were better off than when Mr Trump was elected in 2016, answered yes. One message in the results is that many Americans want government and the public to work through the pandemic in a way that does not see their economies locked down and jobs lost. Mr Trump’s spirit in firing up his base in the final days of the campaign, tirelessly traversing key states to address enthusiastic crowds, made a difference. Mr Biden, in contrast, mostly stayed home in Delaware, appearing in public only occasionally, heavily masked to convey the impression that, unlike the cavalier Mr Trump, he was taking COVID-19 seriously. As in 2016, the result suggests that, questioned by mainstream pollsters, some citizens are disinclined to voice their voting intentions. Mainstream commentators also have given Mr Trump little if any credit for delivering on his promises. Honouring his pledge to appoint well-qualified conservative justices such as Amy Coney Barrett, for example, drew out the powerful pro-life constituency.
As the race came down to the wire on Wednesday night, Australian time, it ground to a worrying halt, unfortunately, creating confusion and anxiety after what had appeared to be a smooth process. At that stage, the precautions to prevent violence, such as boarding up building fronts, appeared to have been unnecessary. At the end of a long day, both Mr Trump and Mr Biden insisted they had a pathway to the 270 votes they needed to take the Oval Office. Fair enough. It is very close.
All the votes need to be counted, and recounted where necessary, as soon as possible. Much hinges on final results in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Mr Trump is ahead in all three. But more than 100 million ballots cast before the election appear to favour the Democrats. And a US Supreme Court ruling has stipulated counting in Pennsylvania can go on until the weekend.
In a further complicating twist, Mr Trump announced at the 11th hour that he was going to the Supreme Court to stop counting any votes yet to arrive at election centres. He labelled the pending results a “major fraud”. Hours after the polls had closed the President said: “We want all voting to stop … We don’t want them to find any ballots at 4 o’clock in the morning and add them to the list, OK?” For the sake of the integrity of the US political system and the strength of the nation’s boisterous, rigorous democracy, any doubts must be cleared up — transparently and as soon as possible. As Paul Kelly writes on Thursday, it is vital the election is settled on the count, not in the courts. The right to vote, as Vice-President Mike Pence said, has been “at the centre of our democracy since the founding of this nation”. It must be protected. So the US — and the world — watches and waits.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Spy claims too grave to ignore	The Australian	Mr Trump must address reports of Russian treachery US intelligence agency reports that Russia’s military spy agency, GRU, paid Taliban militants a bounty to target and kill US and coalition forces in Afghanistan are deeply disturbing. They demand full investigation. Donald Trump insists he was never told about the intelligence. And the White House has cast doubt on the credibility of reports that, if true, disclose deadly, surreptitious interference by Vladimir Putin to aid the Taliban in its war against the US and the NATO-led coalition partners, including Australia.
Despite Mr Trump’s denials, US officials say the high-level intelligence was circulating in Washington in January and discussed at a meeting of the US National Security Council in March. They also claim Mr Trump was provided a full written briefing in the President’s Daily Brief document on February 27 and that details also were contained in the CIA’s classified World Intelligence Review on May 4.
Britain, which like Australia has fought side by side with the US in Afghanistan since 2001, reportedly was told formally by US officials about the Russian bounty payments only last week. Whatever Mr Trump was or was not told, what is clear, as his close friend, Republican senator Lindsey Graham, said, is that full disclosure of the Russian actions is essential. Nothing short of a tough response from the President will suffice. A car bomb attack in which three US servicemen were killed in April last year near the vast Bagram Air Base has been cited as an example in which Russian spy money was paid to incite and reward Taliban killing. If so, it would be unthinkable for Mr Trump not to retaliate against the Kremlin. Facing a battle ahead of the November election, he doubtless hopes US involvement in Afghanistan is almost at an end. But he must show that the US and its coalition partners will not tolerate such action.
The GRU is the same notorious Kremlin spy agency that was responsible for the novichok nerve agent attack on former Russian military officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in the UK in 2018. The system of bounty payments to the Taliban for killing coalition forces appears to be another part of former KGB Colonel Putin’s asymmetric warfare against the West, or perhaps an attempt to avenge the ignominious defeat of the old Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Despite cosying up to Mr Putin, Mr Trump claims he has been “tougher” on Russia than previous presidents. His response to Moscow’s perfidiousness needs to demonstrate that toughness.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
A man who made a difference	The Australian	Mr Wolfensohn tackled poverty with passion and expertise “The purpose of the World Bank is to fight poverty with passion,” announces the sign at the entrance to World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC. James Wolfensohn, who once described himself as “a nice Jewish boy from Sydney”, had the sign put up during his tenure as World Bank president from 1995 to 2005. Mr Wolfensohn, who died in New York on Wednesday at the age of 86, was one of the world’s most successful financial leaders of his generation.
But the Sydney Boys High School and University of Sydney arts/law graduate was much more than a bean counter. He grew up in a small flat in Edgecliff in Sydney’s east, where money was tight for his immigrant parents. He began university early, at 16, but after failing his first year briefly worked as a shoe salesman. After graduation and working as a lawyer at Allen Allen & Hemsley in Sydney he achieved an MBA at Harvard, where he met his future wife, teacher Elaine Botwinick. She died three months ago. From Harvard, he built a career in finance in the US, Britain, where he was knighted by the Queen, and Australia.
He was a generous philanthropist, with a vision for improving life for the poorest people in the world. Philanthropy, he told Washington correspondent Cameron Stewart in 2007, “gives your life a great deal more breadth. Instead of just taking, you can participate in making the society in which you live a bit better.” Mr Wolfensohn also was a renaissance man who fenced for the Australian team at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Making that team, his wife said in an interview with The New York Times in January this year, was “the most exciting moment in his life” for a “colonial kid” who lacked confidence. It had an enormous impact on who he became later, she said. And after a course of cello lessons in his 40s, he played it on stage at New York’s Carnegie Hall — which he had rescued financially, raising about $US60m — to mark his 50th, 60th and 70th birthdays. Never a man to do things by halves, he would practise at the start or end of his working days, 6am or midnight. When he travelled, he often booked the plane seat beside him for his cello to travel unscathed. A confidant of presidents on both sides of US politics, Mr Wolfensohn was nominated to lead the World Bank by Bill Clinton in 1995. Mr Wolfensohn served for a decade, bringing financial savvy to the challenge. Capitalism and trade, he insisted, were important in providing developing nations with opportunities to grow and for people to prosper. Nor would he tolerate the corruption that ransacks many poorer nations. The World Bank, he lamented in one interview, “had never used the word corruption at all until I got there”. Determined to weed out corruption on bank projects, Mr Wolfensohn imposed extensive audits and insisted on more accountability from governments. As he wrote in his 2010 memoir, A Global Life: My Journey Among Rich and Poor, From Sydney to Wall Street to the World Bank: “I was throwing a grenade into an entrenched culture.” He also recognised the risks of globalisation. For all its advantages, he said, “the poor are the most vulnerable to having their traditions, relationships and knowledge and skills ignored and denigrated, and experiencing development with a great sense of trauma, loss and social disconnectedness”. Mr Wolfensohn was uninterested in personal publicity and his life is little known to many Australians, but millions of people are better off as a result of his legacy.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
China’s taunts absurd and wrong	The Australian	Mr Zhao’s lies represent a challenge the world must confront
If he had deliberately set out to make a fool of himself and the regime he represented, senior Chinese “wolf warrior” Zhao Lijian could not have done better than claim Australia had been operating concentration camps on Manus Island. Nothing could be more absurd or demonstrably further from the truth. Neither can anything more comprehensively symbolise the dangerous self-delusion and unrelenting belligerence that underpins Beijing’s every response as it mindlessly lashes out at Australia and launches unbridled onslaughts against countries across the world. As Australian Strategic Policy Institute executive director Peter Jennings said: “Here we have a country aspiring to global leadership which is just slinging insults and abuse around the place, in the spot where there used to be diplomacy.” Geoff Chambers and Joe Kelly reported on Thursday that as of last month the number of refugees and asylum-seekers in Papua New Guinea and Nauru had fallen to 240, with 960 people resettled in the US, Cambodia and other countries since 2015. Of those asylum-seekers and refugees still on the islands, almost all are living in Port Moresby and Nauru communities. The Manus Island processing centre was closed in 2017. The Nauru processing centre does not house any asylum-seekers at present.
Yet in the weird and fanciful world of Mr Zhao’s blatant lies and concocted disinformation targeted against Australia and Australians, the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s Information Department deputy director would have the world believe “tens of thousands of people from war-torn countries” have been accommodated in concentration camps. “The Australian government built detention centres on the Manus Island, which ‘accommodates’ tens of thousands of people from war-torn countries. The concentration camps, as some critics call it, are still in operation,” he tweeted on Wednesday in response to global outrage over China’s appalling treatment of its Uighur minority. He also used a Lowy Institute report to assert “almost one in five Chinese Australians have been physically threatened or attacked in the past year because of their heritage”.
Meanwhile, as we report on Friday, Mr Zhao’s colleague Hua Chunying doubled down on the vilification, targeting Foreign Minister Marise Payne for expressing the Morrison government’s “grave concern” about “severe human rights” abuses against ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. Ms Hua raised issues about alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan, White Australia policy, the Stolen Generations and treatment of Indigenous people. Australia, she declared, was ignoring its own problems while groundlessly accusing China “on the basis of lies, rumours and disinformation” about the Uighurs. She warned “the Chinese people are not to be trifled with … once they are provoked to anger, things can get very tough”.
The politically ambitious Mr Zhao (self-evidently, he is no career diplomat) has form: he was the facilitator of last November’s outrageous fabricated image of an Australian soldier allegedly slitting the throat of a young Afghan girl. That was soon after he boorishly warned members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing group (the US, Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand) that “if they dare to harm China’s sovereignty, they should be aware of their eyes being poked out and blinded”. He has been similarly offensive against the likes of Susan Rice, Barack Obama’s former national security adviser.
On Thursday, his Beijing propaganda machine was again in full flight abusing the 27 EU nations, Britain and Canada, lashing out at them as China imposed unprecedented travel and trade bans on members of parliament, academics, ambassadors and think tanks that dared to criticise China over the Uighurs. EU officials said the Chinese response threatened the future of the big, freshly negotiated EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment that was supposed to be the cornerstone of future relations. There is little that can pass for diplomatic normalcy about Mr Zhao’s deliberate lies and abuse and those of others speaking on behalf of President Xi Jinping’s despotic communist regime. Confronted by the rising tide of Chinese abuse and aggression, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg was right in Brussels to pledge the strong support for Australia of the 30-nation military alliance that is the West’s most powerful military grouping. Mr Zhao’s lies represent a challenge the world must confront. As Mr Stoltenberg said: “It is important that we demonstrate that we are able to stand together when we see China trying to bully countries all over the world.”	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
A century of history at stake	The Australian	Much more than one seat is in play in Saturday’s by-election Most Australians could not name the candidates in Saturday’s Eden-Monaro by-election. But they grasp its significance. Those who follow politics recognise the NSW south coast electorate was a bellwether federal seat for decades, although in 2016 and in May last year it bucked the national trend. Labor’s Mike Kelly was returned last year with a 0.85 per cent margin. Dr Kelly, a war veteran, is retiring due to ill-health caused by severe dehydration suffered when he served in Iraq. In the opposition’s fourth most marginal seat, the loss of his personal following could be a blow to Anthony Albanese.
None of the major parties has had a smooth campaign. The Opposition Leader could have done without the branch-stacking scandal in Victoria. The ASIO raid on NSW upper house MP Shaoquett Moselmane, which highlighted his close personal ties to China, was another blow to Labor. And its billboard in Wagga Wagga, urging voters to support Labor candidate Kristy McBain, was a goof-up that made the opposition look out of touch. Wagga Wagga is not in Eden-Monaro.
The Coalition had a shambolic start, to-ing and fro-ing over whether NSW Nationals leader John Barilaro or state Liberal Transport Minister Andrew Constance would run. Neither did. But as Rosie Lewis reported on Thursday, Mr Barilaro, selfishly, and his supporters have been undermining Liberal candidate Fiona Kotvojs by asking voters to preference Labor. The Australian has seen a voter’s ballot paper that numbered Nationals candidate Trevor Hicks “1” and Ms McBain “2”, despite the Nationals’ official how-to-vote card preferencing the Liberals. Some Nationals want Labor to ­beat Dr Kotvojs so “Barra” can have a crack at the seat later under the terms of the Coalition agreement.
On paper, this is a strong contest between local candidates. Dr Kotvojs, a former teacher, raises cattle and grows truffles on her family farm. She took Dr Kelly to preferences last year. Ms McBain, a lawyer, stepped aside as Bega Valley mayor to contest Eden-Monaro.
The Morrison government’s handling of COVID-19, the economic recovery, rebuilding after catastrophic bushfires and land usage to minimise chances of recurrences are vital issues. Defence, national security and strategic policy are taking on new importance. The last prime minister to win an opposition seat in a by-election was Billy Hughes, who wrested Kalgoorlie from Labor in 1920. The weight of that history compounds the pressure on Mr Albanese, who has more at stake. He does not want to be the Opposition Leader to break the pattern of a century. Scott Morrison wants to see his soaring approval translate to votes. For him, a Liberal win would rank as another “miracle”. It would lift the government’s buffer to 78 seats out of 151, ensuring stability at a critical time. From a national perspective, that would be a good result. It also would see the treachery of certain Nationals go unrewarded.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Ha Vu’s plea should be heeded	The Australian	Myanmar’s economy is already deteriorating with loss of investment The deeply moving plea of “one wife to another” by Ha Vu to Daw Kyu Kyu Hla — the wife of General Min Aung Hlaing, chairman of Myanmar’s ruling junta — to intervene to secure the release of Australian economist Sean Turnell deserves to bring results. Time will tell. Professor Turnell, who is imprisoned at an unknown location in Myanmar, was an adviser to the deposed civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi. He is, as university economics lecturer Dr Hu Va points out, “simply an economist, committed to using his knowledge for the good of others”. As Ticky Fullerton reported on Thursday, Professor Turnell had “been closely advising Ms Suu Kyi on how to open up the economy and build confidence” in Myanmar’s future. His task was to help achieve the investment and job creation Ms Suu Kyi believed was critical for Myanmar’s recovery from the pandemic.
Professor Turnell has been incarcerated since being seized by the military on February 8. The rest of Ms Suu Kyi’s economic reform team, including the minister for finance, planning and industry, both his deputies, and the apolitical deputy governor of the central bank, are also behind bars. As Fullerton reported, the “right type of investment” Ms Suu Kyi and her team hoped for to secure the country’s future was “pouring out of Myanmar”, led by giant Japanese beverages company Kirin and Singaporean gaming group Razer. Both were involved with vast commercial conglomerates controlled by the military, or Tatmadaw, which have dominated business for decades and have done much to enrich the corrupt generals and their cronies. Since the coup, Kirin has said it will end its beer alliance with the Myanmar and Mandalay breweries owned by the Tatmadaw’s Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited. Razer is quitting its investment in a tobacco company owned by MEHL.
Nothing better signals the profound danger confronting Myanmar as a result of the Tatmadaw’s mindless attempt to roll back the democratic gains and economic achievements from the country’s cautious but universally applauded return to a semblance of popular democracy in 2012. For 50 years, Myanmar was in the grips of a ruthless military dictatorship led by the notorious General Ne Win that isolated and impoverished what should be one of our region’s most strategically vital and prosperous nations. General Min Aung Hlaing’s overthrow of Ms Suu Kyi’s democratically elected administration looks like an inevitable path towards a return to the impoverishment and isolation that existed under General Ne Win and his successors. The generals would be wise to recognise the folly of detaining well-intentioned supporters of a better future for Myanmar’s people, such as Professor Turnell. They also need to understand the dangers flowing from their coup. Massive street demonstrations show no sign of abating. Neither does the opposition of Myanmar’s regional partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other groupings that had welcomed Myanmar into the comity of democratic nations. On Tuesday, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi abruptly cancelled a trip to Myanmar to avoid lending legitimacy to the military regime.
Amid hostility to the coup, the generals may see hope in closer ties to China, with which Myanmar shares a 2000km plus border. But popular opposition to Beijing’s biggest project, the $US3.6bn ($4.5bn) Myitsone hydro-electric project on the Irrawaddy River, showed the depth of antagonism that existed towards China. The coup, however, may give Beijing an opportunity to expand its influence in the region. The Tatmadaw is wary of China. Yet as a colleague of Professor Turnell told Fullerton, “the terrible trap the military find themselves in is that they risk becoming dependent on China because no one else will invest in the country”.
There is an alternative to the destructive course Myanmar has taken. It was clearly spelled out in a call on Tuesday by the Vice-Chief of the Australian Defence Force, David Johnston, to Vice-Senior General Soe Win. In demanding the immediate release of Professor Turnell, Vice-Admiral Johnston urged the authorities in Naypyidaw to “refrain from violence against civilians, restore democracy as soon as possible, and immediately release all civilian leaders”. Daw Kyu Kyu Hla should respond quickly to Dr Ha Vu’s plea. For decades, Australia has done much to aid Myanmar’s development. Imprisoning Professor Turnell shows how misguided the generals were to overthrow democracy.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Cool heads needed to calm dissent on climate reform	The Australian	NZ farmers are caught in Jacinda Ardern’s net-zero emissions scheme
Having settled on the pragmatic position of a technology-led, unofficial net-zero emissions target, possibly by 2050, Scott Morrison now must navigate the volatile forces within his own side of politics. Giving comfort to his Nationals Coalition partners and farmers is the first substantial challenge. Nationals leader Michael McCormack has told the Prime Minister that key members of his partyroom have warned they will not support any climate package that fails to include protections for agriculture, mining and manufacturing. The Deputy Prime Minister cited the exemption of farm sector emissions in New Zealand’s carbon-neutral pledge for 2050.
All of Australia’s earlier climate policies, from the Howard government’s proposed emissions trading plan to the Gillard government’s carbon tax, have included exemptions for high-emissions, trade-exposed industries such as cement-making and aluminium smelting. The issue of carbon leakage, where high-emissions industries shift countries to avoid emissions penalties, is still an issue that must be considered. Nothing has been proposed by Mr Morrison on climate that would require a vote in parliament. But if the Prime Minister fails to acknowledge the internal concerns and to act to quell any dissent, he could face the same destabilising forces that have toppled other leaders on the issue of climate, including Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott, Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd.
Ironically, the position carved out by Mr Morrison and solidified in his address to the National Press Club last week should have avoided any need for debate on the issue. Mr Morrison effectively accepted a net-zero carbon dioxide emissions target but said its timing was dependent on technology providing a clear pathway for how this could be achieved. Mr Morrison says the bottom line is there will be no tax measures, either a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, to push along the timetable for net zero. Under the thinking set out by Energy Minister Angus Taylor, low-emissions technologies ultimately will be taken up by industry when they are the cheapest and best option available and therefore more profitable than the status quo. The argument is this will deliver greenhouse gas emissions savings and possibly a net-zero goal by 2050 regardless of whether government sets a mandate. The difficulty is that with climate change politics, everything is fluid.
Setting a net-zero target has become a global benchmark that many leading nations have adopted, including Australia’s key trading partners such as Japan and South Korea. The fine print is that Japan’s net-zero target is conditional on a revival of nuclear energy and South Korea’s target is non-binding. Nonetheless, Australia is under pressure to declare a net-zero target for 2050 as opposed to some time in the second half of the century, which it had agreed when it signed the Paris Agreement. Mr Morrison’s recent comments have laid the groundwork to make it possible to announce a net-zero target for 2050 if it is considered politically prudent to do so. The first real pressure will come at a special meeting called by US President Joe Biden for April and later at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s COP26 meeting in Glasgow on November 1.
The relentless incrementalism of climate pledges is underscored by the New Zealand experience. When the net-zero target was announced in 2019, agriculture — which makes up about half of NZ’s total emissions — was exempt. However, last October NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said farmers had a five-year period to reduce emissions or face higher taxes. During that five-year period the agricultural sector is expected to develop a farm-level pricing mechanism separate from the nationwide emissions trading scheme. If a new scheme is not established, agriculture will be folded into the New Zealand ETS by default in 2025. If the Ardern government does not think farmers are moving quickly enough, the carbon cost measures can be brought forward to next year.
Peak farm groups in Australia say they are already working to be carbon-neutral. Meat & Livestock Australia has set a target to be carbon-neutral by 2030. This target means that, by 2030, Australian beef, lamb and goat production — including lot-feeding and meat-processing — will make no net-release of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Politically, however, the issue is sure to play differently among individual farmers and regional towns and electorates. The Morrison government already is investing heavily in reform measures that will make it easier to reward farmers for improving productivity by sequestering more carbon in their soils. Breakthroughs in technology such as feed additives to limit greenhouse gas emissions from livestock should help the MLA make progress on its 2030 target. By ruling out price subsidies for electric vehicles this week the federal government has been consistent in its message that cutting greenhouse gas emissions must come with a proper cost-benefit consideration. This same measure must be applied to farming and other industry groups as the government seeks to widen greenhouse gas emissions savings from sectors outside of electricity generation. Rumblings from the Nationals partyroom show there is still a long way to go.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Learning from the GST reform	The Australian	National cabinet could be a springboard to a more effective federation
As the nation faces a post-COVID budget deficit of $197.7bn this financial year and gross debt of more than $1 trillion later in the decade, important lessons can be learned from the cabinet papers from 2000. The papers, released by the National Archives on Friday, cover the implementation of the GST by John Howard and Peter Costello. It was a mammoth change for the better for the nation and a mammoth challenge for government, business and the public — announced during the Howard government’s first term and implemented during the second term. It is indicative of the weaknesses of subsequent governments, oppositions and Senate crossbenchers that 21 years on, the 10 per cent GST remains Australia’s most recent major achievement of systematic reform.
Economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of the national cabinet process provide the Morrison government with a springboard from which to launch long overdue federation reform. Business leaders hope, for good reason, that the spirit of pragmatic collaboration fostered by the national cabinet will endure. In his survey of top chief executives, John Durie found strong support for the national cabinet experiment to lead to greater co-operation across state and federal jurisdictions. For corporate Australia, like government, the focus this year will rightly be on creating jobs. To that end, Scott Morrison should use his political capital well to tackle difficult reforms in industrial relations and in taxation. States continue to levy too many small, nuisance taxes. And the nation remains heavily reliant on income and company taxes. Our company tax rate for the largest corporations is uncompetitive with that of comparable economies and therefore a deterrent to investment and private sector job creation.
The lesson from the cabinet papers from two decades ago is that to bring about major reform, political leaders need to develop it as policy, articulate it to the public and implement it. In the case of the GST, the reform was proposed and taken to the 1998 election, where the Howard government won a narrow mandate. The reform was then negotiated with state governments and with the Australian Democrats in the Senate before it became law. Patient, methodical and detailed processes, clear explanations to voters and a willingness to compromise were essential to the process. Mr Howard, John Anderson and Mr Costello — who presided over a government that delivered budget surpluses, paid off $96bn in government debt and set up the Future Fund — were interviewed by Troy Bramston to mark the release of the papers. The former prime minister, deputy prime minister and treasurer encourage the Morrison government to direct fiscal policy towards budget surpluses. Post-COVID, this is a tall order, but their concerns about the burden on future generations and problems when interest rates rise are prudent. As Mr Howard says, the most effective way to cut debt is to get the economy growing, a process that will require further reform.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Andrews looks inward as NSW looks beyond Covid	The Australian	National cabinet must plan ahead as vaccines change the dynamic The contrast in outlooks between the leaders of the nation’s two most populous states is striking. In preparation for Friday’s national cabinet meeting, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been looking ahead, suggesting a shake-up in the management of the next phase of the pandemic. With NSW recording 46 days with no new local COVID-19 infections and the vaccine being rolled out, Ms Berejiklian will suggest the possibility of stopping daily infection updates. The proposal has merit. Daily updates will be phased out at some point and it is time to start the conversation. If not, “it will be too long before we change”, she says. Living with COVID in future, she says, could mean judging “how well we’re doing by keeping people out of hospital”.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, in contrast, is looking inward, refusing to say when he will allow the resumption of international flights into his state. He barred overseas travellers, including returning Australians, from Victoria more than a fortnight ago. Despite his fatuous boasting last month that Victoria’s hotel quarantine system had “higher standards” than those of other states, he seems to have little faith in it or in the state’s contact tracing system.
Mr Andrews also appears to hanker after a risk-free world. He has asked the state’s medical experts to look at the impact of variants of the virus on the risk profile in hotels. When “we can have a system where we have the lowest possible risk, then flights will start again”. The risk of a “wildly infectious strain” of COVID-19 escaping into the community, he says, is too high to allow international arrivals. He refuses to give a date when Melbourne will reopen to returning Australians and others.
NSW, by comparison, is taking 3010 people a week, Queensland is taking 1000 people, South Australia 530 and Western Australia 512. Victoria’s refusal to co-operate shows scant regard for the liberties and wellbeing of 39,000 Australians stranded overseas who are registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as wanting to return. About 5000 of them are considered vulnerable. Before Mr Andrews called Victoria’s five-day lockdown from February 13, the state was taking up to 1120 travellers a week. West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has backed down from his plans to extend some border restrictions beyond the pandemic. But, keen to be the strongman of “fortress WA”, he now wants police at the border to be able to search vehicles for drugs as they enter the state.
National cabinet also is expected to discuss the vaccine rollout and a framework for keeping domestic borders open after lobbying from Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce. Keeping state borders open is crucial to ongoing economic recovery, especially in the airline and tourism sector. Qantas has warned of further job losses if state borders continue to be slammed shut and international borders remain closed beyond October. Qantas domestic and international chief executive Andrew David told a Senate committee this week that border closures had cost the airline $11bn in lost revenue and forced 8500 job cuts. Lifting the ban on international students entering Australia should be part of the next phase of recovery. COVID-19 remains a serious problem in many nations, but vaccines have sent new case numbers plummeting. The US recorded 57,700 new infections on Tuesday, down from about 250,000 a day in January. Britain is recording about 6300 cases a day, down from about 60,000 on some days in January. While the flu is obviously far less contagious and has lower mortality rates than COVID-19, living with the virus could resemble living with the flu in future, as Ms Berejiklian says. After the strongest six months of growth in recorded history, with GDP in the December quarter smashing expectations to lift by 3.1 per cent, Australia’s recovery is far ahead of most of the world. It is time to face the future with confidence.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
NSW approach put to the test	The Australian	National definition needed for hotspot locations and rules It is early days but NSW again is setting an example for other states in how best to respond in a measured way to the health and economic threat posed by the pandemic. While other states are losing their heads and slamming shut state borders, NSW is localising disruption, stepping up contact tracing and encouraging those not immediately impacted to go about their business with care. The Gold Coast and Ningaloo are off-limits but Sydney residents are still being encouraged to visit regional centres and enjoy the festive season. The emphasis is on making sure that citizens allow their movements to be logged properly in case contact tracing is necessary.
The actions of the NSW government are in stark contrast to cries on the ABC and elsewhere that community members cannot be trusted and must be locked inside for their own good. It will be several days before a full account can be made of how far the COVID-19 outbreak that started in Sydney‘s northern beach suburbs has spread. The early news, however, is positive. The official figures on Monday were that infection rates had eased.
There were 15 locally acquired new cases announced on Monday, all of which were linked to the Avalon cluster on Sydney‘s northern beaches.
If the trend continues to fall without a breakout in other areas of Sydney, it is possible that restrictions in place in NSW to contain the northern beaches outbreak could be relaxed for Christmas. The considered response of NSW compares favourably with the trigger-happy responses of other states, which have effectively slammed the door on Greater Sydney, causing chaos for business and families.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan closed the border with NSW immediately the Sydney cluster was known. Victoria and South Australia followed, and Queensland on Monday reimposed a hard border with its southern neighbour, which it said will not be reconsidered until there have been 28 days of no unlinked cases of COVID-19 in NSW. This makes the earliest reopening date for unrestricted travel between Greater Sydney and Queensland January 8, a diabolical blow for tourism operators over the Christmas period.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is right to call on her state counterparts to take a more mature response with border closures. She is speaking for millions of Australians whose plans for Christmas have been thrown into turmoil. NSW has led by example on the issue. The only time the state has closed its border to anyone was Victoria at the time of the second-wave outbreak. At that time Victoria’s case numbers were more than 140 and rising. Ms Berejiklian has been a lone voice calling for actions that are proportionate to the risk.
It is still possible the NSW cluster may escalate and expand beyond Sydney’s northern beaches. But it is fair to expect that decisions to restrict travel and other liberties be based on facts rather than politics and emotions. Scott Morrison has taken tentative steps to bring some uniformity to how decisions are made on restricting national movements. The Prime Minister says the door is always open for talks on a national agreement for what should constitute a coronavirus hotspot and what restrictions should apply. Constitutionally, the states have freedom to decide. But there are national as well as personal implications to the decisions that are made. NSW is conducting its response to the northern beaches cluster against a chorus of naysayers who favour a lockdown as a first response. If it succeeds, the NSW approach will have proven itself to be a model that effectively can balance health and economic outcomes with minimum disruption to the fortunes of businesses and the liberty of citizens.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Espionage and open democracy	The Australian	National security tools are blunted if used for the wrong job
Obscured from public scrutiny, there is a drama being played out in a Canberra courtroom that raises important questions about open justice, protection for whistleblowers and the right of the public to be informed by an unfettered and independent media. Seven years after this newspaper reported claims that Australian intelligence had bugged East Timor’s cabinet room during negotiations over a division of resource spoils in the Timor Sea, Canberra lawyer Bernard Collaery, who represented a whistleblower, faces trial on national security charges to do with public exposure of these events.
Also under national security law, Attorney-General Christian Porter has issued a non-disclosure certificate, the stated purpose of which is to prevent sensitive intelligence from being revealed during court proceedings. In a pre-trial hearing the ACT Supreme Court is considering how much of the case against Collaery will be open to scrutiny by the media — and therefore the public.
By definition, it is difficult to make any categorical judgment about whether this secrecy is warranted but clearly there are vital principles at stake, starting with the presumption that justice should be seen to be done. The national security law invoked by Mr Porter dates from 2004 and reflects the undeniable need to enable counter-terror and intelligence agencies to work effectively so the safety of the public can be protected, without which civil liberties are at a discount. It would be intolerable if prosecution of terrorists itself were to jeopardise national security. But this setting aside of open justice, this suppression of media reporting and public knowledge of events of potential importance, must be used only when absolutely necessary.
The effective operation of national security legislation — and of agencies charged with security and policing — depends in no small part on public confidence, trust and co-operation. If Australians come to believe that the government is using these laws for a purpose other than genuine reasons of national security, then it is not only the credibility of politicians that suffers but also the cause of national security itself. And that weakens the country in the fight against bad actors who would threaten our values and our citizens.
Right now Australia is coming under increasingly unfriendly pressure from the global heavyweight that is the People’s Republic of China. The case against Mr Collaery, on one view, is an awkward historical footnote in our diplomatic and trade relationship with East Timor, a relative minnow. As former Victorian premier Steve Bracks suggested in this newspaper on Monday, it is far from obvious how this past controversy raises such pressing issues of national security that it warrants the intervention of the commonwealth’s first law officer.
Mr Bracks speculates that the prosecution of Witness K and Mr Collaery is an attempt by the Coalition government to shield from embarrassment John Howard, prime minister at the time of the espionage operation, and his foreign minister, Alexander Downer. We can’t know, but Mr Bracks overlooks the tendency of government, regardless of which parties or personalities are in power, to vigorously defend what its functionaries have done in the past. Sometimes this is an attempt to gloss over mere embarrassment, sometimes it is a serious cover-up. In the Collaery case, Mr Porter’s use of this extraordinary power of “non-disclosure” seems to lack a compelling rationale in national security. This is not to say that acts of espionage can be weighed according to simple moral rules. Pragmatic decisions and robust actions may be required to protect vital interests of state and to safeguard the public. Spies, like police, sometimes have to do unpleasant work so the rest of us can continue to live peaceful lives in which we are not confronted with such dilemmas.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
WHO COVID-19 response has worsened the disaster	The Australian	Nations that fund it should demand thorough reform
It is not yet certain whether the World Health Organisation’s sudden retreat from its previously trenchant defence of China’s disease-ridden “wet markets” was a direct consequence of Donald Trump’s announcement that he was suspending US funding for the organisation. The US has been the WHO’s major donor for decades, contributing $US452m ($704m) a year to the organisation’s $US4.2bn annual budget. The WHO’s change of heart about the wet markets suggests director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is finally starting to understand the extent of global anger over the WHO’s bungling of the COVID-19 pandemic that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
As Mr Trump said in announcing the suspension of US payments, the COVID-19 outbreak could have been contained at its source with far fewer deaths and worldwide economic damage been avoided had the WHO done its job and sent medical experts into China earlier to objectively assess the situation and call out China’s lack of transparency at the outset. “Instead, the WHO took Chinese assurances at face value and defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising China for its so-called transparency,’’ the President said. “I don’t think so. The WHO’s reliance on China’s disclosures likely caused a 20-fold increase in COVID-19 cases worldwide, and it may be even more than that. Countries across the world are suffering devastation because of its failure.” As the world passed 2 million coronavirus cases with 127,000 deaths, Mr Trump’s arguments were a telling indictment of the failure of the UN agency that is funded by the nations of the world to lead the response to catastrophes such as this pandemic.
The world needs an international health body. But as the truth emerges about the WHO’s handling of COVID-19, it is clear that if it is to survive beyond the current crisis, the world’s nations, especially members of the G7 and G20 which contribute the lion’s share of its funding, must insist on a major overhaul to vastly improve its performance. Too often in UN organisations, officials let political influences destroy good policy outcomes and operations.
Mr Trump has reason to be particularly angry after 27,000 deaths in the US so far from 615,000 cases of the disease. As Cameron Stewart reported on Wednesday, shocked Americans witnessing scenes of hospitals being overrun and body bags piling up on top of each other in refrigerated trucks are “asking questions about why they are watching such desperate scenes in a country as advanced as the US”. The pressures on Mr Trump in the lead-up to November’s election are immense.
He is far from alone in his concerns about the WHO. Modelling by researchers at the University of Southampton concludes that global cases of COVID-19 could have been reduced by 95 per cent had China, and the WHO, acted three weeks earlier to alert the world to what was happening.
And Scott Morrison is facing pressure from backbenchers to make Australia’s $53m-a-year taxpayer-funded contribution to the organisation conditional on reforms to the body. Even some Labor MPs agree. But he and Josh Frydenberg cited the WHO’s good work in the Pacific as a reason Australia would not be halting or cutting funding to the organisation. Mr Morrison, who has been highly critical of the WHO over its unfathomable endorsement of China’s wet markets, wants reform of the WHO from within its own ranks.
China, which has donated only $133m to the WHO in the past two years, hit back on Wednesday at claims that it had manipulated international institutions. Two days ago, the WHO insisted it would not advocate for the closing of Chinese wet markets because they were “sources of livelihood and food security’’. But on Wednesday, the WHO special COVID-19 envoy David Nabarro said the markets were a danger because “75 per cent of emerging infections come from the animal kingdom’’.One of the WHO’s worst calls at the outset was to oppose the Trump administration’s January 31 decision to ban flights from China. WHO claimed the move would be “counter-productive” in dealing with the outbreak. As Mr Trump said on Tuesday, despite reports circulating as early as December about the virus, the WHO “failed to investigate reports from credible sources in Wuhan that conflicted with Chinese official accounts. There were credible accounts of human-to-human transmission in December which should have spurred it to investigate. Instead, he said, through mid-January the WHO “parroted and publicly endorsed (Chinese insistence) that there was no human-to-human transmission’’. At that stage, it said the virus was not communicable and travel bans were not necessary. Mr Morrison, too, was highly critical of the WHO’s tardiness, noting that his government “called this thing (the pandemic) weeks before the WHO did. If we were relying on their advice, then I suspect we would have been suffering the same fate that many other countries currently are. We were calling it a pandemic back in mid-January.’’ The WHO, he said, did not adopt the term until March 11. The WHO has fallen abysmally short of its mission statement to lead global health responses. Its failures have contributed to loss of life and made the impact of the disease worse for millions of people.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Queensland too big to let fail	The Australian	Neither side of politics has a plan to break the debt trap
Our third largest state, home to 20 per cent of the nation’s population, is too important economically to be allowed to fall into mendicant status. Queensland’s books are turning deeper red, however, and Auditor-General Brendan Worrall bluntly warns that the Palaszczuk government is in danger of being unable to meet its operating costs with revenue alone.
The state’s 2018-19 financial audits show that since 2016-17, Queensland government expenses increased by 11 per cent, almost double the 6 per cent increase in revenue. The Mid-Year Fiscal and Economic Review in December revealed government debt would reach $91bn in four years, even after the decision to take $5bn from the surplus of the public servants’ defined benefit superannuation fund for a new debt offset account, to be invested by the Queensland Investment Corporation. Raiding hollow logs is no long-term solution to bad fiscal management. The 5.7 per cent unemployment rate is the second highest in the nation after South Australia. The state’s population is expanding above the national average, although some of the fastest growth is among the elderly.
Eight months from the October election, neither Labor nor the Liberal National Party opposition have produced plans to tackle the underlying problems, especially runaway public service wage growth. Neither side has a viable policy or has shown an inclination to encourage private investment to broaden the state’s economic base. The risks of over-reliance on coal and tourism are clear. MYFER showed softening coal prices have caused a $677m reduction in royalties this year. Labor’s Peter Beattie, in contrast, campaigned vigorously in 1998 on detailed industry by industry strategies to kickstart investment and jobs. Leaders on both sides, unfortunately, did not build on the momentum generated in the Beattie years in scientific and medical research and hi-tech industries.
Jackie Trad, the divisive leader of the government’s Left faction, is under pressure in Labor ranks to step down from the leadership team, as Michael McKenna and Sarah Elks revealed on Thursday. The Treasurer is unpopular after engulfing state Labor in an integrity crisis last year. But policies, not personalities, are the real problem. The dominant Left’s big-government approach is acting as a handbrake on the business sector, although Queensland has been better than other states in developing liquefied natural gas. Gas aside, the state’s main industry lobbies complain of the worst business conditions in Queensland’s history, arising in part from excessive bureaucracy. Peak employer organisation Australian Industry Group head Rebecca Andrews identified one of the main problems on Wednesday when she said the government should include private sector investment in its debt-repayment plan by reversing its implacable opposition to privatisation.
Like Labor, the LNP, short-sightedly, has ruled out asset sales or leases to repay debt and kickstart private investment. While Labor has allowed the public service to balloon by 28,000 equivalent full-time jobs after the Newman government reduced it by 14,000, LNP leader Deb Frecklington has ruled out forced redundancies. At this stage it is not clear whether she would cut the bureaucracy by other means. In the coming election, offering voters a small target and playing on opponents’ unpopularity will not be good enough. Queensland needs an injection of strong leadership, not business as usual or, worse, the paralysis of a hung parliament with Katter’s Australian Party, One Nation, Greens or independents dictating play.The Auditor-General’s warning is blunt. The state must increase revenue or constrain recent growth in expenses, or it risks “not being able to meet the cost of its activities”. The major parties owe it to voters to explain the way forward.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL High house prices help for Govt	Hawkes Bay Today	Never mind coronavirus, this Government heads into 2020 inoculated against economic shock by the very thing it promised to end — soaring house prices.
This is an election year and if the wealth effect of rising Auckland house prices is what it takes to restore confidence and lift economic growth then I suspect the Government is going to take it.
The inconvenient truth, that house prices are again riding to the economic rescue, was laid bare by the Reserve Bank last week.
It’s taking a relaxed, wait-and-see approach to coronavirus risk because of the resurgent market.
In terms of timing it has been helpful for the Reserve Bank and its straight-talking Governor Adrian Orr wasn’t shy of acknowledging that.
“With house prices rising, that wealth effect is alive and giving and people will be more confident to consume and borrow to consume,” Orr said.
The Reserve Bank is forecasting around a 7per cent annual increase in house prices.
The bank’s other job (besides monetary policy) is to keep a close watch on New Zealand’s private debt levels.
But for the past 18 months, it has been more concerned with an economic slowdown.
It will be relieved that it has headed off the downturn in time to face-off a big external risk, like coronavirus.
But a 7per cent annual lift in house prices should come as a serious blow to those who were hoping to see meaningful shift in the housing equation.
On the current median Auckland house price of $885,000, 7per cent would equate to an increase of almost $62,000.
That’s an extra $12,000 a first-home buyer would need to find for an already improbably large 20per cent deposit.
If you own a house, that kind of net wealth increases, even if it’s just on paper, and makes people more relaxed about their debt levels and more comfortable spending.
Sadly, it doesn’t create much real wealth the way that actually making more stuff and selling it to the world does.
Here we are, then, heading into a fresh election cycle with a government buoyed by a housing market that’s making the rich richer.
So I doubt we’re going to hear a lot about this issue from either side of the political spectrum this year.
In the interest of staying in power the Government is sending a clear economic message to centrist voters: look we didn’t break it.
To those hoping for more meaningful change the message seems to be: trust us we’re working on it.
Meanwhile, the National Party is never going to alienate its core supporters with policies that hurt housing. It is attacking the Government for stealing its policies and arguing they aren’t as good at delivering them.
We look set to see an election fought over competency and cultural approaches, with serious economic reform — of either political flavour — consigned to the back burner.

Covid shaped Kiwis’ poll result	The Australian	New Zealand needs Ms Ardern to govern from the centre After winning admiration for the way she has dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, there was little doubt Jacinda Ardern was headed for a big victory in New Zealand’s election on Saturday. Few among even her most enthusiastic supporters, however, expected her Labour Party to win 49.1 per cent of the vote and 64 seats in the 120-member parliament. It was the party’s best result since 1946. For the first time since then, Labour will be able to govern on its own. The expectation, however, is that to shore up support on its left flank it will again govern in a so-called progressive alliance with the Green Party. The minor party won 7.6 per cent of the vote and will have 10 seats under the country’s electoral system. At the 2017 election Labour won 36.89 per cent of the vote and the governing centre-right National Party 44.5 per cent. Ms Ardern had to scramble for support, eventually winning the backing of the Greens and Winston Peters’ New Zealand First party. On Saturday the once dominant National Party under Judith Collins, its third leader in a year, was reduced to 26.5 per cent of the vote and 35 seats. NZ First, with 2.7 per cent, fell short of the 5 per cent threshold to win seats.
Ms Ardern should be under no illusions about the challenges she faces. As economics editor Adam Creighton wrote on Saturday, New Zealand “in the space of half a year has blown its savings, smashed its two pistons of economic growth — tourism and immigration — and embarked on one of the world’s most ambitious money creation programs”. Net migration of 86,000 across the year to March will collapse to 5000 this year, with little prospect of revival until there is a COVID-19 vaccine. The country’s gross domestic product tumbled 12 per cent in the June quarter, almost twice as much as Australia’s. Extra spending and lost tax revenue was equivalent to almost 20 per cent of New Zealand’s GDP. Ms Ardern must honour her pledge to “govern from the centre”. It will help that she will not rely on the Greens for survival, even if they are in alliance with her. With the OECD projecting 8.9 per cent unemployment, urgent macro-economic reform is needed to recover from the downturn and, as Creighton put it, to “shake the economy out of its funk”. Yet Labour’s platform centred largely on planting one billion trees, a 100 per cent renewable energy target by 2030 and big spending on health, education and wage subsidy schemes. “Jacindamania” over Ms Ardern’s COVID-19 success worked at the polling booth. But it masked her policy failures and New Zealand’s deepening economic crisis. The landslide puts Ms Ardern in a position of power few NZ prime ministers have enjoyed. She has the numbers to achieve hard-headed economic reforms the Greens may not like but the country needs. She will have no excuses for failing to deliver.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
EDITORIAL Cost of herd immunity a hard lesson	Wanganui Chronicle	New Zealand often gets compared to Nordic nations, but usually for similarities.
As people look at what has and hasn’t worked in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, we have frequently been grouped with Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Finland as other plucky, female-led places that have got on top of the coronavirus through restrictions, testing and tracing.
But we are also drawing comparisons with Sweden as two countries with opposite approaches.
Whereas we chose to “go hard” to keep deaths to a minimum and suppress the virus, Sweden relied on citizens to voluntarily protect themselves with social distancing and good hygiene. Most schools and businesses were kept open. The elderly and ill were asked to stay home.
Sweden’s model has been held up as an example of herd immunity, especially by some politicians, business leaders and pundits focused more on economic fallout than health safety.
Evidence that avoiding lockdown could keep profits ticking over while gradually spreading immunity in the population, is mixed.
Sweden’s central bank has forecast an economic contraction in the export-reliant country of between 7per cent and 10per cent and unemployment of 10per cent. The eurozone contraction is expected to be 7.75per cent.
And the cost has been steep. Nursing home residents and the immigrant community have been hit hard. Sweden, with about 10 million people, has had 3925 deaths and 32,809 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. That is more than three times the combined 1112 death toll from about 16 million people in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland.
But Sweden overall has fewer deaths per capita than Spain, Britain, Italy and France which all had lockdowns. One of the key lessons of the pandemic is that lockdowns need to be early in an outbreak to be most effective. For instance, Columbia University research estimates that America could have prevented at least 36,000 deaths if it had begun social distancing a week earlier than it did.
In terms of immunity, studies of antibodies in England, Spain, France and Sweden suggest about 5per cent of those countries’ populations have had the virus – well below the 60per cent estimated to be required for herd immunity.
Regardless of how they initially dealt with the virus, countries now face the same problem of rebooting economies and resuming links.
We went with a goal of elimination. So far, our approach has been more successful in saving lives and controlling the outbreak. When we eventually expand our bubble to Australia and beyond, we will invite risk in. Will we be ready?— NZ Herald	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses

We say Time to make a difference and keep local business alive	The New Zealand Herald	New Zealanders are waking up today ready to start enjoying their first weekend in alert level 2 and properly out of lockdown.
Our freedom of movement is back (nationally, at least), we are free to socialise outside our bubbles (albeit only in groups of 10 or less for now), and the bulk of workers will be returning to the office or workplace on Monday — at the same time as the vast majority of the nation’s children also go back to school or early childhood facilities. The new “safer normal” has begun.
What a difference an alert level makes!
For many businesses, however, alert level 2 will not reverse the effects of the lockdown, and is instead the start of a long, slow, difficult road to recovery — particularly for those still most affected by social-distancing rules, such as the hospitality sector, and those most affected by our border closure, notably the aviation and tourism sectors.
While some businesses have managed to hold out, or have been kept afloat by the Government’s wage subsidy scheme and other financial support measures, the weeks, months and years ahead will be testing. Some businesses will inevitably fail, some may only just remain viable, and it is likely many won’t return to comfortable profit margins for a long time.
But, rather than feel helpless and hopeless, this is the time we as individuals can make a difference — particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises, the economic backbone of the country.
NZME’s “Go Local!” campaign — launched as the country moved into alert level 3 — is a call to action for people and businesses to support local businesses in their community, by buying locally or New Zealand-made products, instead of spending with overseas companies. Now, in level 2, we can start supporting in person the likes of local cafes and restaurants, as well as many more retailers, too.
Many of these smaller operators have needed to innovate almost overnight, developing websites to advertise their goods and services and finding ways to sell and deliver to customers in a contactless manner under level 3, and are now adjusting to level 2 requirements.
The least we can do for businesses — particularly those of us whose household spending budgets have been less affected — is provide support in a targeted way that gets money flowing again and helps kick-start the economy.
And for those people who have the time, money and ability to travel now domestic restrictions have been lifted, get in behind our “Go NZ!” campaign, too, launched before lockdown started, to highlight the options for staycations in our own backyards.
Is there a favourite place you love escaping to? A place you’ve always wanted to visit but never got around to, a place you’ve put off visiting because of the crowds? There’s no better time to leave town and see another part of our beautiful country — and support local businesses, tourism operators and accommodation providers while you’re there.
Just remember the level 2 rules that now apply around physical distancing, congregating, good health and hygiene, and diarying your movements in case contact tracing is required.
We have battled a global health crisis, endured unprecedented social restrictions, and are facing the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression.
Our challenges are far from over, but, as our amazing team of five million has shown over the past seven weeks, together we can make a difference.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
COMMENT Towards alert level 3 and the ‘recovery room’	The Northern Advocate	New Zealanders wake up this morning to another weekend in lockdown. Another weekend that has come to look remarkably similar to the rest of the week — and the weeks and weekends before it — for the house-bound majority.
But this weekend there is a difference; this weekend could be the country’s last in alert level 4.
On Monday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her Cabinet will make a decision about whether to lift or extend the nationwide lockdown from Thursday — a month after it was implemented in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19 and eradicate it from our shores.
Last Thursday, a week ahead of that teasing, possible new-dawn horizon, the Prime Minister broadly outlined what life after lockdown would look like.
It seems clear, however — and both Ardern and Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield were at pains to emphasise — alert level 3 will still look a lot like lockdown.
Ardern said, “Level 3 is a progression, not a rush to normality.”
So, in large part, the same or similar measures of the past month will continue to apply.
While indicating the importance of getting some businesses and education facilities back in operation, the message remains: while we are “over the peak”, we are by no means “out of the woods”.
Bloomfield says the lower alert level actually means “increased vigilance” is needed by everyone.
To this effect, we will need to dampen down expectations somewhat.
On an individual level, while we may now be able to go for a swim, surf, mountain bike or day walk, we still need to do these things alone or only with people from our bubble. Any signs of public “congregating” will be clamped down on, and activities that carry risk — such as hunting and boating or anything “motorised” — are still banned.
While we may be able to expand our “bubble” slightly in some cases, it is clearly too soon for heartfelt reunions with friends, loved ones and the extended whānau. The message is still to keep our bubbles “small and exclusive”.
This may offer more contact for the elderly, for whom it is acknowledged loneliness may be taking a toll, but there is still clearly a need to protect them and people with compromised immunity, so maintaining strict hygiene and social distancing will still be vital.
There is partial relaxation around life events such as funerals/tangi and weddings, but they must be restricted to no more than 10 people, services only, and no associated functions.
While children up to Year 10 can go back to early childhood centres and schools if necessary, the message is still for parents to keep them learning online at home if possible.
Those who do make it into the classroom will find new bubble rules will apply, playtimes will look different, and social isolating rules still apply.
Public playgrounds are still a no-no, as there is still a high risk of transmitting the virus on frequently touched equipment.
Businesses and industry will get the much-needed green light to resume operations in an cautious effort to open up the economy, but again only in some cases and only if operators can adhere to safety, hygiene and social-distancing measures.
There will still be severe limitations for retail and hospitality.
So, while we can now grab a drive-through takeaway, it will still be some time before we can go out with a group of mates to a bar, cafe, restaurant, or the mall.
When it comes to travel, the message will change from “stay local” to “stay regional”.
The Cabinet won’t make the decision to move to level 3 lightly. If it does, there will be a high level of trust, responsibility and common sense placed on all New Zealanders.
We must use our judgment, continue to be cautious, and rise to the occasion.
If we can do that, if we can be patient for just a while longer, if we can continue to reduce the number of cases and community transmission, retain confidence in our testing, contact tracing and quarantine measures, there is much to be (cautiously) optimistic about.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

The Cabinet won’t make the decision to move to level 3 lightly. If it does, there will be a high level of trust, responsibility and common sense placed on all New Zealanders. We must use our judgment, continue to be cautious, and rise to the occasion.
If we can do that, if we can be patient for just a while longer, if we can continue to reduce the number of cases and community transmission, retain confidence in our testing, contact tracing and quarantine measures, there is much to be (cautiously) optimistic about.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Deterring rule breakers a better answer	The New Zealand Herald	New Zealand’s approach to beating Covid-19 has relied a lot on trust, encouragement and unity — with everyone encouraged to be team players to get the best result.
It has mostly been successful, and we have gone 86 days without any cases of community transmission of the virus.
But since restrictions were introduced earlier this year, there has been at least some friction between those prepared to co-operate because they know it is for the common good, and those who prefer to act in their own interests.
With the coronavirus pushed outside, the border has become a line in the sand.
A simplistic ‘them and us’ theme has taken hold during debate about whether returnees should pay for quarantine costs — the Government is considering it — and over some people escaping their mandatory hotel stays.
Another quarantine breach on Friday night, involving a family from Australia wanting to attend a funeral, will have stirred sympathy for the grieving people’s circumstances.
More generally, though, it suggests once again we are still riding our luck with Covid-19 despite the recent border security overhaul.
Just one escapee from quarantine could spark an outbreak in the community. As we read about the struggle to control the outbreaks in Victoria and New South Wales, and follow rising case numbers in countries such as India, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico and the United States, it is hard not to fear a renewed spike here.
Those Kiwis who live here permanently may consider we have a greater stake in our welfare and future than those flapping home from offshore.
But there should not be a divide between those already here and those returning. The more important distinction is between those who act responsibly to keep us all safe and those who are prepared to take risks during a pandemic regardless of the consequences.
More than 30,000 people have returned without incident. Only a handful have become headlines for breakouts for shopping trips. Likewise, while millions of people in New Zealand obeyed lockdown rules, thousands here were fined in April for breaching restrictions.
In New South Wales the penalties for breaking quarantine rules are harsh: A maximum A$11,000 fine, six months in prison, or both with a further A$5500 fine for each day the offence continues. People also have to pay for their quarantine costs.
Here, people found to be breaching the rules can be fined up to $4000 or jailed for six months. Kiwis could be held for up to 28 days if they refuse a coronavirus test.
What other measures could be considered? Potentially other penalties could include offenders having to restart from zero and pay for an extra 14-day stay, a penalty for time spent on the run, and paying costs incurred in finding them.
Our quarantine border system is best focused on deterring people from breaking the rules, rather than penalising those who want to co-operate.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease

EDITORIAL Challenges, chances in Covid-19 recovery	The Northern Advocate	New Zealand’s careful climb out of Covid-19 restrictions has been a tale of two journeys. To envious overseas eyes, we have been a smooth success story and a source of hope. At home, there’s been both pride and frustration.
The bottom line is we have got our coronavirus case numbers down in a controlled way and can safely reopen our economy.
That’s important to head off any future waves of infection and to ensure that in level 2, people will jump back into more normal life with confidence.
Many countries are in nowhere near as good a position as us, but some are still starting to reopen with their infection and death rates at best on a downward trend. Some American states are easing restrictions despite cases still being on the rise.
The aim is to keep finances, businesses and jobs afloat. But this real-time experiment could be inviting higher death totals, spikes in cases and future shutdowns.
Reopening is a difficult process to handle right.
Germany has dealt with its outbreak much better than most, but even so, has introduced a fallback clause. Regions will reimpose restrictions if infections rebound.
South Korea, which has been impressive with its test and trace approach, is having to douse a new cluster involving nightclubs after more than a dozen cases were linked to one man who visited three venues in Seoul.
Britain is only now introducing a border isolation system, weeks after other countries did so.
The pandemic has been an economic conundrum. Economies may reopen, but unless the public feels safe, businesses may struggle.
The correct sequence is to squash the virus, get an effective defence in place to keep it down with testing, contact tracing and isolations, and have a clear system of new public protections in place for work, business and socialising.
Our ability to follow that script has drawn admiration from foreign medical experts and media. But here – amid remarkable unity over health safety goals – there has also been chafing at the pace of our emergence from lockdown and fears over loss of jobs and income.
Is our leadership nimble enough to stay on top of the virus firefighting, while maintaining public co-operation, outlining a pathway out of economic disaster, and snapping up opportunities?
Pandemics, like climate change, are bad but the upheaval is, conversely, an opportunity for change, innovation and improvement.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses

EDITORIAL Spread your support around	The Daily Post	New Zealand’s love affair with fast food has been highlighted this week as we emerged from level 4 lockdown.
It seems getting a McDonald’s fix was the most important thing in the world for some people.
People queued from 4am outside McDonald’s in Rotorua and from 3am in Tauranga on the first day of level 3 freedom. At one Auckland KFC outlet customers abused and swore at workers after they ran out of original chicken and had to offer alternatives.
This behaviour shows a level of fast food obsession I find staggering. But it also raises immediate and important issues — safety, acceptable behaviour and spreading around our support for local businesses.
It is essential people keep safe as they flock towards food and retail outlets. A case where this did not happen was outside Burger Fuel in Glenfield on Tuesday night where 30 people packed together waiting to collect their orders. What part of physical distancing did the outlet and customers not understand? Surely they could have all stood further apart. Burger Fuel has since introduced measures in an effort to prevent this happening again.
Every business now operating needs to take note of what happened here and ensure they too have stringent measures in place. They cannot rely just on their customers exercising safe distancing.
It would be a catastrophe for all if our hard-earned success in smacking Covid-19 head-on was undone and we had to go back into level 4 lockdown because people couldn’t follow common-sense rules when selling and buying.
The KFC abuse example is disgusting and has no place in New Zealand.
But the other important issue here is to ensure we spread out our support for local businesses.
This paper, along with others in the NZME media stable, this week launched GO LOCAL! — a campaign aimed at encouraging local people to support local businesses.
We must show our support for local businesses as we try to kick-start the local economy. Yes, people love food from the big chains. These outlets can be locally owned and employ local people, so we should support them. But let’s also spread around our support by buying from smaller operations too.
Buy a takeaway from your local Indian, Thai or fish and chip outlet, for example. We must ensure these smaller businesses — and other types of operations in our communities — survive. We’re all in this together. Let’s support local businesses — safely and with respect for others.

It seems getting a McDonald’s fix was the most important thing in the world for some people.
We all saw amazing yet perhaps unsurprising scenes of people queuing outside fast food restaurants as soon as they were able. At one Auckland KFC outlet customers abused and swore at workers after they ran out of original chicken and had to offer alternatives.
This behaviour shows a level of fast-food obsession I find staggering. But it also raises important issues — safety, acceptable behaviour and spreading around our support for local businesses.
Firstly, it is essential people keep safe as they flock towards food and retail outlets.
A case where this did not happen was outside BurgerFuel in Glenfield on Tuesday night where 30 people packed together waiting to collect their orders.
This incident, which rightly drew stern fire from the Prime Minister, was disgraceful. What part of physical distancing did these people not understand?
BurgerFuel has since introduced measures in an effort to prevent this happening again.
Every business now operating needs to take note of what happened and ensure they too have stringent measures in place.

EDITORIAL World and Aussie cases dent travel plans	Wanganui Chronicle	New Zealand’s plan for travel with Australia is looking shakier, and the immediate problem is not with our own border security.
While we have been consumed with fallout over quarantines, testing and tracing, the coronavirus threat has worsened beyond our closed borders.
Cases are on the rise in the United States, parts of Europe, South America, Asia, and the Middle East as the world nears 10 million confirmed infections and 500,000 deaths from Covid-19. In one of the biggest outbreaks, India has now pushed past 500,000 cases.
On Friday, the US set a daily record for new cases of nearly 40,000. It then followed up with 45,000 on Saturday, according to one tally.
The country’s previous daily peak of 36,400 was two months ago.
The new increases appear linked to the re-opening of states several weeks ago. Texas and Florida have had to reimpose some controls.
Although death rates are yet to spike, Reuters reported that the virus could trigger diabetes and damage the brain.
US news anchor Dan Rather tweeted that while he’s often gone to where the story is: “This is one ... I would be happier watching from New Zealand”.
Our country and Australia were included in, but the US was left off, a draft European Union list of countries whose people will be welcome to enter the bloc from July. Europe has mostly squashed the virus to low levels and ended lockdowns.
Yet the World Health Organisation said that weekly case numbers had increased in 30 countries in the agency’s Europe region — which includes the Middle East and central Asia — for the first time in months.
And France at the weekend reported its biggest increase since the end of May.
But it is an outbreak much closer to home that is of most concern to us. Victoria’s case numbers have risen close to 2000, including 30 and 41 reported on Friday and Saturday in the Australian state.
“We currently have 260 cases that indicate they are community transmission, we don’t have a clear source for those cases.
“So that’s an increase of 15 since yesterday,” deputy health officer Dr Annalise van Diemen said. Most of the state’s cases have been in Melbourne and a testing blitz is under way. As with New Zealand, Australia is experiencing an influx of returnees.
Victoria, like here, has also had problems with people in quarantine refusing to take tests and is looking into whether it can force returned travellers to do so. Its refusal rate is about 30 per cent. It all suggests that much needs to be ironed out before we can consider risking wider, non-quarantine travel and with it, the threat of community virus spread.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

COMMENT Musk’s net dream stargazers’ nightmare	Wanganui Chronicle	New satellite tech promises to reach the last unserved parts of the world with affordable broadband, but could it mean we’ll end up cluttering the skies with shiny space junk?
Internet access via satellite reaches remote areas but done the traditional way it’s a mixed bag. It works, but since the “birds” have traditionally gone in very high orbits, performance and responsiveness of the broadband service tends to be a bit iffy.
SpaceX boss Elon Musk plans to launch O3b satellites from his Falcon 9 rockets with a view to attract broadcasters and communications providers.
Musk himself is going after end users with his Starlink satellite project, aimed at connecting the last few souls on the planet in remote areas to the internet for US$80 ($123) a month.
Starlink satellites orbit the Earth just 550km away from the surface.
That’s Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) and Starlink customers should get a quick broadband service. But a lot of Starlink satellites are needed for coverage because of the VLEO and more will join the existing constellation.
A crazy amount in fact: 720 have been launched, and Starlink has permission from the United States Federal Communications Commission to fire 12,000 satellites into the skies. Musk has said 20-30,000 Starlink satellites are needed for the intended global coverage, but not 200,000 (phew). Put in perspective, there are currently 2666 satellites orbiting the Earth. Astronomers and stargazers are already up in arms on social media.
Maybe you detect a whiff of Nimbyism here. However, you only need to go out at night somewhere with no street lights to understand why darkness is so amazing. Dark sky areas are rare, fantastic and popular attractions. New Zealand has the Aoraki Mackenzie Dark Sky Reserve, one of just 11 certified such places in the world. Martinborough is seeking to become a certified Dark Sky Reserve as well.
Great Barrier Island and Stewart Island are Dark Sky Sanctuaries, and there’s the Dark Sky Park in Wai-Iti.
Urban sprawl and excessive night lighting is eating into the remaining dark areas though. Next there will be conga lines of shining “disco ball” satellites as well.
Starlink has tried to address the criticism by testing dark, matt coating paint but even then, the satellites are still visible. Their data transmission signals also create noise that drown out radio astronomy observations. Yes, there is benefit to hooking up remote populations to the internet but Starlink seems a bored billionaire’s pet project that tries to provide a solution for a few in a way that’s intrusive to many. Watch this space ...

Containing mini-spike is vital	The Australian	Nobody should leave quarantine without COVID-19 testing The nation’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Michael Kidd, is correct. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases in Victoria is a concern, but it is not a second wave of the pandemic. Australia, fortunately, largely escaped a first wave compared with most of the world. But Victoria’s biggest single-day rise in infections for more than 12 weeks — 49 new infections reported on Sunday after 41 on Saturday — is a wake-up call. As Professor Kidd says, Australians who have not downloaded the COVIDSafe app should do so.
The Andrews government is right to insist that travellers quarantining in hotels will spend an extra 10 days locked down if they refuse to take COVID-19 tests. Such selfishness is intolerable and it beggars belief that such testing has not been mandatory until now. It should be, in all states. The advent of saliva tests, as opposed to slightly uncomfortable nasal tests, should assist the process. The testing and tracing blitz under way in the hardest-hit areas of Melbourne is on track. If, as Premier Daniel Andrews suggested on Sunday, stay-at-home orders are imposed on the most at-risk suburbs, these should be for as short a time as practical, tightly centred and closely monitored. A sharp, effective lockdown to contain mini-outbreaks might prevent wider interruptions in opening up the rest of the Victorian economy and those of other states. If successful, such stay-at-home orders could serve as a model for when other, fresh outbreaks of coronavirus arise, which is inevitable. While Mr Andrews is being unnecessarily coy about the link between an Eid family celebration and one of the outbreaks in Melbourne, he has no reason to be. All citizens must be held accountable for social distancing and other precautions. The NSW-Victorian border remains open, as it should, but NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has urged NSW residents to avoid Melbourne and for NSW organisations to exclude visitors from hotspots. Fair enough. It would be reasonable for Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia to take the same approach. But further postponing their border openings would be a costly own goal.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
We are in this together Editorial	Wanganui Chronicle	None of us is untouched by what we’ve come to know as Covid-19.
We’ve all seen some big events dominate headlines over the past 12 months, but none has dominated our lives in the same way this coronavirus has.
We know in times like this people turn to trusted news sources for information, and it’s our responsibility to keep you in the know, whether via our website, app or this, New Zealand’s oldest continuously surviving newspaper.
Of course there is so much coverage of Covid-19‘s effects on New Zealand and the world, so much information it can be hard to take it all in.
That’s why we endeavour to make sure you, as a valued reader, know what you need to know.
We want you to know how serious this is, but also to know it’s not a time to panic.
It’s a time for compassion, consideration and kindness. It’s a time for common sense and listening to official medical advice.
It’s a time to make sure we all know what’s needed of us when it comes to our own hygiene and interacting with the wider world.
We want our staff to be safe, and we want to be able to continue to bring you news of Covid-19.
That means our office doors will be closed, with many staff working from home, though the Chronicle and NZME are very much still open for business.
We still want to hear from you, all about your great stories, and we still want to connect our readers with local businesses, who we should all support.
At a time we all should be keeping our distance from each other, it’s important we also come together as a community, in spirit if not in body.

NSW sets standard as other states panic over borders	The Australian	Northern beaches Covid battle is not won yet; the approach is right When Scott Morrison declared the NSW system for COVID-19 testing, contact tracing and suppression to be “the gold standard”, many who would prefer a more heavy-handed approach sneered. The evidence is coming in, however. And so far it appears to vindicate the Prime Minister’s judgment and the integrated suite of measures being relied upon by the Berejiklian government, which learned its lesson after the Ruby Princess fiasco highlighted weaknesses in its quarantine system. Gladys Berejiklian has not inspired blind loyalty on Twitter. Nor has she been accorded the status of secular saint by the left, as has New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. However, Ms Berejiklian has produced impressive policy outcomes when lives, and livelihoods, depended on her. Unlike some of her counterparts in other states, Ms Berejiklian has attempted to balance containment of the virus while maintaining a functioning economy and upholding basic liberties of the citizenry. The norms of the Westminster system were preserved, and parliament continued to sit and conduct the people’s business.
A mere eight new cases of COVID-19 acquired through local transmission were identified through 44,466 voluntary tests to 8pm Monday. Yet those raw statistics conceal a deeper message about the health of the Australian Federation. Ms Berejiklian chose to use a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer to tackle the crisis. While the leaders of other states are inclined to panic and slam their borders shut at the first sign of a sneeze, the NSW Premier has adopted a cautious, balanced approach.
As recently as Sunday and Monday, Ms Berejiklian and her Health Minister, Brad Hazzard, were being abused by the social media lynch mob for refusing to impose the same draconian measures employed earlier in the year by Victorian Premier Dan Andrews. West Australian Premier Mark McGowan had one of the loudest megaphones. But the NSW leadership, to its credit, trusted the state’s health professionals and the people to collaborate in undergoing testing and exercising prudence. They recommended that people wear masks on public transport and in other settings but treated their citizens as adults, not inmates.
To solve a problem largely of his own creation, Mr Andrews, in contrast, imposed a severe lockdown, which included a curfew with no medical rationale. Mask-wearing was made mandatory and the entire population of his state was effectively incarcerated inside their homes for 23 hours a day for months. Only an outcry from respected jurists and influential lawyers forced him to abandon the more draconian elements of an omnibus bill, the like of which had not been seen in this country in peacetime. Forming a crisis cabinet, Mr Andrews ruled by executive diktat for most of the year. Despite revelling in the theatre of his daily media conferences, his government has been exposed as incompetent and evasive by an inquiry whose limited scope of investigation he tailored.
Yet even that inquiry, by Justice Jennifer Coate, found glaring, systemic failures of governance. The shambles constituted a damning indictment of the authoritarian approach personified by Mr Andrews. Yet to his delusional Twitter foot soldiers, Mr Andrews was the true victim of the pandemic, attacked by annoying journalists asking probing questions. After a year of posturing at the podium, while effectively crippling his state, and undermining living standards across the nation, Mr Andrews’ sycophants are ready to follow his bid for re-election in 2022, announced on Monday.
The contrast with Ms Berejiklian is stark. Neither she nor NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant seemed to crave adulation. They got on with building excellent contact tracing systems. They took the people of NSW into their confidence, and they have responded. In so doing, Ms Berejiklian has shown it is possible to contain this virus without crippling the economy. For her diligence she has been repudiated by parochial opportunists, such as Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, whose insistence that NSW achieve 28 days without community transmission before she reopens the hard border is unattainable over the school holidays. The ruling will dash the hopes of thousands of families who had hoped to take a summer holiday north of the Tweed. After a very bad year, it will further damage Queensland’s tourist industry. As Ms Berejiklian has cautioned, it would be premature to declare victory. The results released on Tuesday are grounds for hope. However, as Peter Collignon, Professor of Microbiology at the Australian National University, warned on Sky News on Monday night, the risk of a spike in numbers remains for some days yet. Professor Collignon rejected the hyperbole of some epidemiologists about rampaging outbreaks caused by “super spreader’’ events such as Christmas gatherings. The Crossroads Hotel at Casula, in southwest Sydney, was intrinsically more dangerous in the depth of July than the northern beaches outbreak, he said. Viral chest infections were more contagious in cold weather when people are confined in poorly ventilated spaces. Even so, the next few days will be critical.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Angry Adam Bandt’s challenge	The Australian	Not long ago, when the Soviet Union’s admirers included former Greens senator Lee Rhiannon, Kremlinologists used to pore over the placement — or sudden disappearance — of politburo members in photos, decoding the shifts in power. On Tuesday, Adam Bandt was elected unopposed as the new leader of the Greens. It was a bloodless succession — this country being a democracy, for all its faults in the eyes of social justice warriors — but the deliberative processes of the party can be strangely furtive and old-fashioned.
No open contest of exuberant candidates for the top job, no town hall debates of competing vision or policy detail, no sense that they — and we — emerge from the process with a firmer grip on what the Greens are all about. On Monday, Bob Brown spruiked the “galaxy of great potential leaders” to replace Richard Di Natale. This makes it sound a tough choice, but with only 11 members the logistics aren’t tricky. The leadership machinations — boring or portentous, who knows? — are a black hole. It’s a reminder that a lot of the worst things said about the party came not from outsiders but from members complaining of factional thuggery and beastly behaviour hidden from the rest of us behind the Green Curtain.
The closed society of the Greens is galling partly because of the propensity of its leaders constantly to demand openness and transparency from every other political actor, often attributing to them all kinds of bad faith and concealed conflicts.
This kind of thing is not only tediously self-righteous but also politically unintelligent. Minor parties don’t have to agree with the majors but they do have to make an effort to understand them if any kind of political collaboration is to work. On Tuesday, as a newly minted leader, Mr Bandt declared himself ready to sit down with Scott Morrison to find common ground on climate change. His idea of smoothing the way was to suggest the Prime Minister’s current policy would kill three times as many people as had died so far in the bushfire season.
A lawyer by training, Mr Bandt comes across as a hanging judge, not a negotiator. In the thick of the bushfire crisis he tweeted a photo of Coalition MPs as “Exhibit A in the upcoming climate trials”. His apocalyptic denunciations of killer companies and criminal politicians — death everywhere — simply don’t jell with his maiden speech renouncing “fear and suspicion”. Back then, too, he paid tribute to former industrial law clients: the “real workers and families” of the Latrobe Valley power stations.It’s this mainstream reality that should energise Mr Bandt: not hurling courtroom charges or terrifying the mob but being upfront about his priorities while willing to persuade, juggle trade-offs and be part of the common search for workable solutions.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Great in a crisis, Australia cannot lose it in recovery	The Australian	Nothing should be off the table in revitalising the economy
As the Morrison government does whatever it takes to keep oxygen flowing to the economy’s failing organs, the door is ajar to every red-blooded rent-seeker and schemer in the land. In three escalating emergency moves, it has promised to pump $214bn into the economy to support businesses and top up family incomes. It’s likely Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg will do more on the fiscal front as companies hibernate over winter; a budget in October seems light years away from this vantage point. In any case, it was good to see the Prime Minister and Treasurer hold firm by denying Virgin Australia, now in voluntary administration, a taxpayer bailout. As Mr Frydenberg said, the 90 per cent foreign-owned carrier’s major shareholders have deep pockets, if not gold vaults. With a number of parties interested, a market-led solution offers the airline the best prospect of survival.
Imagine the conga line for deals if the government had made an exception for Virgin Australia. You can grift your way out of bother for a little while, but it’s not a sustainable model to build prosperity for companies or workers. Nor is Big Canberra, as it saunters into novel areas, such as private hospitals, free childcare, brokering rents and nationalising half the nation’s payroll. We take Mr Morrison at his word when he says hard times require mammoth, targeted and temporary responses. Sure, but it won’t be easy to shift out of crisis handout mode, to snap back to tightly means-tested, mutual obligation welfare. Those receiving $1500 a fortnight via the six-month JobKeeper package won’t easily settle for the $1100 JobSeeker payment (which has been doubled) when that day comes. Given the alliance of business, community and union groups pushing for an increase in unemployment benefits before the coronavirus, and its imminent double-digit unemployment rate, a hefty increase in the welfare bill will be baked into the federal budget.
Myriad forces unleashed by COVID-19 are reshaping our nation, shifting the political calculus, watering down ideology, emboldening policymakers and revamping household budgets. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, who is remaking monetary policy, observed on Tuesday that many old rules would no longer apply when the economy comes off the ventilator, due to structural change. Pervading the recovery, expected by the end of this year, will be the shadow of uncertainty that people feel about the future. “We are all learning to work, shop and travel differently,” Dr Lowe noted. “Some of these changes will probably stay with us, requiring a rethinking of business models.” The best way of dealing with these reverberations is to reinvigorate the country’s growth and productivity agenda, which had been put on hold.
As we observed on Wednesday, the RBA governor has been prodding the political class on reforms to make us “a great place for businesses to expand, invest, innovate and hire people”. He set out a broad framework — on tax, infrastructure, education and training, regulation and industrial relations — that sensible experts and legislators have outlined over the past decade. On any of these, both major parties have not even scratched the surface, either in office or as part of election platforms. The thinking has been done: from Ken Henry’s almost nose-to-tail 2010 tax review (he was prevented by Labor from considering the GST) to the Productivity Commission’s landmark 2017 Shifting the Dial strategy ordered up by Mr Morrison as treasurer. Other notable policy contributions have come from the Business Council of Australia on tax, investment and productivity and NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet on reforming federal financial relations through a grand bargain to run social services on a fixed share of income tax.
Many see a spirit of co-operation between governments in responding to COVID-19 via the national cabinet. But the crisis will pass; all parties will revert to playing their customary roles in cost shifting and blame gaming. So the time to strike on reform is now. If Canberra is too “comatose” or “sclerotic”, as Mr Perrottet has described the dynamic, then the states should get on with their own changes. Who’s to stop them? Daniel Andrews has banked a wad of political capital. Will the Victorian Premier use it to build his population’s productive capacity, or fritter it away on niche social progressivism? The NSW Treasurer should abolish stamp duties on property transfers and introduce a superior land tax that makes it easier for people to move to where jobs are located or occupy housing best suited to their stage of life.The crisis is a golden opportunity for state treasurers and finance ministers — not for triage-era announceables, spending boondoggles or a lazy policy holiday. But the opposite: to remove impediments to more investment and employment. Of course, some states are carrying huge debts and an aversion to privatisation that limit their options, especially Queensland. Mr Frydenberg, too, must make the running on red tape and tax reform. Ad hoc investment allowances might make a difference at the margin. But cutting the company tax rate to 25 per cent for all businesses would supercharge capital spending and make our enterprises more globally competitive in the recovery phase. Mr Morrison wants some fresh ideas from business, yet most of the very good ones have been staring policymakers in the face for years. Team Australia head cheerleader Dr Lowe reminds us that all those factors that have made us such a successful and prosperous country will still be there when the coronavirus crisis has passed. It’s how we use those vast endowments that counts.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Sharing burden of coronavirus	The Australian	OK, boomers, Gen X and millennials, it’s time for sacrifices
Defeating COVID-19 requires asking for something from each of us. At the simplest level, everyone is bearing part of the burden now. To flatten the curve of infections, entire industries have been shut down, with affected workers on a reduced, subsidised wage or on unemployment benefits. Some employees are being asked to work reduced hours or take annual leave. High-profile chief executives are taking a pay cut, symbolic gestures no doubt for some. Professional sports people, always at risk of injury in time-limited careers, are on hiatus from their leagues and will suffer lost income.
Yet as most workers feel the pain, Queensland’s 224,000 public servants are set to receive a 2.5 per cent pay rise plus a one-off $1250 cash payment. These protected workers are taking part in an all-staff ballot to approve the deal, which amounts to a 10 per cent rise across four years. It’s untenable, if not immoral. Letter writers have noted that many people calling for tougher social-distancing measures, leading to harsher economic pain, are themselves shielded from consequences — be they broadcasters or officials. Perhaps they will face the chill of austerity when the public sector is wound back, as it must, because of the looming debt overhang.
In outlining the new flat-rate $1500 a fortnight JobKeeper wage subsidy this week, Scott Morrison highlighted our egalitarian ethos; it spares Australia from a fight over equity implications. Britain and Canada have opted for fixed percentages of existing salaries in their schemes. JobKeeper will apply to six million people, those stood down and employed; full time, part time and, casual workers as well as sole traders; businesses of all sizes, although large companies will need to establish a drop in revenue of 50 per cent. Of course this extraordinary nationalisation of private payrolls comes with a huge fiscal cost: $130bn for the first six months.
The Morrison government’s “whatever it takes” economic support superstructure, so far worth $214bn or 11 per cent of gross domestic product, will lead to mammoth budget deficits and spiralling debt. As we argued on Wednesday, our young people are on track to become “Generation Debt”, lumbered with higher taxes and disrupted lives. “Bad economic times can have deep and persistent scarring effects on many people, particularly the young,” Judith Sloan observed in her column. Millennials and Generation Z have never known the deprivations of war, like their grandparents perhaps, but many now will experience interruptions in learning and career progression, a loss of liberty, and mental health issues. Adult children may have to stay even longer at home or return to live with parents.
We’re facing a calamity that calls for shared sacrifice. As the Prime Minister keeps saying, we all have a role to play in stopping the spread of COVID-19 and in preserving the social bonds that sustain us. Baby boomers, those born from 1946 to 1964, are carrying a huge load. Many have seen their retirement nest eggs destroyed and will remain in the workforce longer than they may have wished. Or if already retired, they will be facing a severe income hit and capital meltdown. Many also will be crunched by the needs of two other generations, caring for aged parents and grandchildren. Yet, in many other ways, boomers have been a privileged generation, enjoying free-range childhoods in the long postwar boom, free tertiary education and an accumulation of assets, such as housing, secured in more affordable times.Naturally, boomers take umbrage at being described as “old” or “vulnerable” in the time of corona. As a group, they are healthier, more socially and physically active, and far more likely to be in paid work than their predecessors. Ordering people aged 70 or older to stay in their homes will be as insulting as it is ridiculous for many of them. Yet that’s the advice of the medical experts we have been relying on to ease the strain on our health system and save lives. In responding to the pandemic, decision-makers, in good faith and armed with facts, have had to draw hard lines on compliance. In the spirit of sharing the burden, we must, if only temporarily, yield to the greater good.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Old Auckland suburbs have a charm that still draws people in [... ] [Derived headline ]	The New Zealand Herald	Old Auckland suburbs have a charm that still draws people in — streets of bungalows or villas, or 1930s old English-style houses in leafy suburbs. They speak of a time when kids walked everywhere, biked on the streets or wandered from house to house to play.
It is easy to see why the family who have lived in this week’s cover house loved bringing up their now-grown kids in the house that sits next to their ‘own’ park, with gardens, attics and bedrooms, trees to climb and regular trick-or-treating at Halloween. Now, agents report, kids from dozens of families at open home viewings are equally excited by a garden that begs exploring.
We’ve got a grand old lady in Remuera with the tennis court for parties, a bungalow in Point Chev that hosts cricket matches and games of tag, and country and beachside spreads that say ‘come out and play’.
We’ve also got two special heritage apartments, one in the city overlooking Myers Park, and the one in Parnell. A clever 2000 retrofit of an early 1863 house shows how well good design ages — and still works for how we want to live today.
Enjoy checking out your new homes.

Abraham Accord breakthrough	The Australian	On a rare day for Middle East peace, hope and history rhyme Donald Trump can take considerable credit for Tuesday’s historic signing in Washington of the Abraham Accord, or accords as he calls the agreement covering the normalisation of relations between Israel and the Arab states of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The accord — named after the prophet of Judaism, Christianity and Islam — is not “the dawn of a new Middle East” as the US President claimed, at least not yet. But it is significant and represents a remarkable triumph for his strategy in casting aside the failed conventional playbook for how peace might be achieved between Israel and its neighbours.
For years US negotiators tried to get Israelis and Palestinians to give up something for peace and a two-state solution. Deadlock inevitably followed, with each side seeing concessions as a lose-lose outcome. Mr Trump, with his transactional approach, focused instead on achieving a win-win peace arrangement between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain. They are the first Arab states since Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994 to sign what are effectively formal peace treaties with the Jewish state. Mr Trump says similar deals with other countries are well advanced, with Oman, Sudan, Morocco and Saudi Arabia mentioned: “We (have taken) a major stride toward a future in which people of all faiths and backgrounds can live together in peace and prosperity.” The Palestinians, who have sidelined themselves, are furious. Their leaders talk of being “stabbed in the back” by their Arab brothers. But they have only themselves to blame. Moderate Sunni Arab states such as Bahrain and the UAE are fed up with mindless Palestinian refusals to negotiate realistically with Israel. Even Palestinian leaders cannot deny the accord is a potential game-changer in the Middle East. Mr Trump has cannily tapped into deepening regional apprehension over Iran’s belligerence and nuclear ambitions. His Middle East credentials among worried moderate states have been boosted by dumping Barack Obama’s misguided nuclear deal and the way he went about liquidating the notorious terrorist mastermind of Tehran’s aggression, Qasem Soleimani, early this year.
Mr Trump’s December 2017 announcement that he was unilaterally recognising the incontrovertible reality that Jerusalem was Israel’s capital was greeted with outrage, particularly in the Arab world. Critics claimed it spelled the end of peace hopes. The signing of the Abraham Accord shows how wrong those dismal assessments were. Arab nations have paid a high price for their self-inflicted isolation from Israel’s economy, which is the most dynamic in the region. Their stance has hurt investment and exacerbated poverty. The accord shows the extent to which the mood in the Middle East is changing. Even the 22-nation Arab League, often a hotbed of anti-Israel ferment, did not support a Palestinian demand to condemn the UAE’s diplomatic ties with Jerusalem. With the US election imminent, it is no surprise Mr Trump is exploiting the historic agreement for all it is worth. It will help him among evangelicals and the powerful US Jewish constituency. The President has earned bragging rights. But the bigger issue is whether obdurate Palestinian leaders will recognise the tide is turning and return with greater realism to the negotiating table with Israel.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
EDITORIAL Tale of two countries in virus response	The Northern Advocate	One could be described as heaping coal on a dying fire while the other is damping down the flames to leave it smouldering overnight for the next morning.
The strategies of New Zealand Finance Minister Grant Robertson and his Australian counterpart Treasurer Josh Frydenberg for economic survival and recovery make an interesting comparison.
Australia’s Government and central bank have unleashed a massive shot of fiscal and monetary stimulus worth A$189 billion. The measures include cash payments of as much as A$100,000 to small businesses, loan guarantees, support for apprentices and a doubling of unemployment benefits.
Australia’s fiscal stimulus in response to coronavirus is worth around 3.5 per cent of GDP and looks broadly to keep companies going and keep consumers confident and buying.
This side of the pond, New Zealand’s rescue and recovery package so far is a mere 1.6 per cent of GDP and is intended not to speed the economy up, but to stop it as much as possible, protecting people’s incomes while we endure a total lockdown. The better it does this job, it argues, the better we emerge. Robertson this week elaborated on his “whatever it takes”’ references in recent days as the Government continues to focus on “getting money out the door” to people and businesses needing it. “[It is] is very much ... keeping people’s incomes going, keeping their attachment to their workplaces going, and supporting businesses to remain viable.”
He told the Epidemic Response Committee that, as of yesterday, the wage subsidy has paid out $4.2b to 642,000 employees. He expected it to be “well over the $5 billion mark”.
Westpac NZ chief economist Dominick Stephens called Australia’s approach of providing stimulus in an attempt to boost demand, “futile”.
The different approaches aren’t that surprising, given New Zealand Government debt is much lower than that of other advanced economies. This week net debt was announced as $600 million below forecast at 19.2 per cent of GDP, although that will look very different post Covid-19.
“I think people are going to see New Zealand as a bit of a safe haven,” says Mitchell McIntyre, a dealer at XE. “It’s becoming more and more obvious ... just how well-placed we are down here.”
As that realisation spreads, it’s essential Robertson’s approach leaves us in the best position possible to attract investment.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

EDITORIAL Scammers’ vaccination certificates jeopardise all	The Northern Advocate	One thing we can be sure of when anything big captures the world’s attention, is people trying to make money out of it by dodgy means.
The coronavirus pandemic has been a magnet for scammers since the start.
British authorities estimated that £34.5 million ($68 million) has been stolen in Covid-related fraud and cybercrime in the past year in the UK.
There have been cases around the globe of fake tests, protective gear and vaccines.
And also profiteering on real jabs. The BBC reported people were paying between US$500 and US$750 ($715-$1075) to get authorised doses unavailable to them.
Now security experts are particularly watching trends over fake proof of vaccination. The BBC said some fake vaccination certificates are being sold for US$150 ($215).
With vaccine roll-outs under way in different countries, vaccine passports and certificates are the new targets as people anticipate travelling again.
Covid passports will eventually be New Zealanders’ gateway to tourist travel without quarantine.
People overseas are already being required to produce proof of tests or vaccinations at some event venues and for international travel.
The real-world evidence of vaccine protection is increasingly positive, although vaccine roll-outs are battling to get ahead of the spread of new variants and Covid case spikes are occurring.
Scientists expect modified booster shots will be needed as early as next year.
Some people, still hesitant about getting a jab, may prefer the appearance of vaccination to actually going through with it. One ad on the dark web offered a “vaccination certificate for Covid (for those who do not want to be vaccinated)”.
Ekram Ahmed of cybersecurity firm Check Point told ABC News: “Cyber criminals are looking to capitalise on the public’s interest to get the vaccine or avoid the vaccine. It’s only a matter of time before hackers find a way to organise fraudulent activity for digital passports.”
Countries planning to use Covid digital passports via a mobile app include the United States, European Union members, China, and Japan.
In New Zealand there’s also been a specific interest in whether pre-departure tests results are always genuine or not.
Since mid-January, people landing here from most countries have had to prove they had a negative test before their flight.
There have been doubts about the tests considering people can get infected in transit.
Covid scams are widespread because so many people are desperate to get a vaccine or get access to something they want that a jab or a test provides, such as escape from the fear of infection or the green light to head home.
In countries where Covid-19 infection rates are high, vaccination queue-jumping remains a concern.
Authorities’ mishandling of the pandemic response last year, slow vaccine roll-outs, rows over supplies of shots, and the hoarding of doses have given opportunists openings worldwide.
This year is an improvement on the utter shambles of 2020, but the world’s recovery from the pandemic is likely to be slower than it needed to be. More cooperation and coordination over vaccine production and distribution obviously would have speeded up the process. The fact that governments are still scrapping over supplies is a surprise to no one.
Any fraudulent behaviour in a pandemic jeopardises us all. The potential for the virus to slip the net is only heightened by such misdeeds.

Now security experts are particularly watching trends over fake proof of vaccination. The BBC said some fake jab certificates are being sold for US$150 ($215).
With vaccine roll-outs under way in different countries, vaccine passports and certificates are the new targets as people anticipate travelling again.
Covid passports will eventually be New Zealanders’ gateway to tourist travel without quarantine.
People overseas are already being required to produce proof of tests or vaccinations at some event venues and for international travel.
The real-world evidence of vaccine protection is increasingly positive, although vaccine roll-outs are battling to get ahead of the spread of new variants and Covid case spikes are occurring.
Scientists expect modified booster shots will be needed as early as next year.
Some people, still hesitant about getting a jab, may prefer the appearance of vaccination to actually going through with it. One ad on the dark web offered a “vaccination certificate for Covid (for those who do not want to be vaccinated)”.
Ekram Ahmed of cybersecurity firm Check Point told ABC News: “Cyber criminals are looking to capitalise on the public’s interest to get the vaccine or avoid the vaccine. It’s only a matter of time before hackers find a way to organise fraudulent activity for digital passports.”
Countries planning to use Covid digital passports via an app include the United States, European Union members, China, and Japan.
In New Zealand there’s also been a specific interest in whether pre-departure tests results are always genuine or not.
Since mid-January, people landing here from most countries have had to prove they had a negative test before their flight.
There have been doubts about the tests considering people can get infected in transit.
Covid scams are widespread because so many people are desperate to get a vaccine or get access to something they want that a jab or a test provides, such as escape from the fear of infection or the green light to head home.
In countries where infection rates are high, vaccination queue-jumping remains a concern.
Authorities’ mishandling of the pandemic response last year, slow vaccine roll-outs, rows over supplies of shots, and the hoarding of doses have given opportunists openings worldwide.
This year is an improvement on the shambles of 2020, but the recovery from the pandemic is likely to be slower than it needed to be. More co-operation and co-ordination over vaccine production and distribution would have speeded the process. That Governments are still scrapping over supplies surprises no one.
Any fraudulent behaviour in a pandemic jeopardises us all. The potential for the virus to slip the net is only heightened by such misdeeds. It is in all of our interests to be alert and sound the alarm on anything suspect.NZ Herald	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Pitching to overseas students	The Australian	Online courses and broadening the market base are keys to growth Now that more than 840,000 Australians have had their first injections against COVID-19, planning to kickstart the export of education services should be a priority, of universities and governments. Over-reliance on the nation’s two main sources for international students — China and India — which account for 55 per cent of Australia’s overseas student population is potentially fraught, as Education Minister Alan Tudge said last week. His goals for a greater emphasis on finding emerging markets and offering more online options are worthwhile. The current concentration limits the perspectives in classrooms and leaves the sector vulnerable to changes, he said, as seen during the downturn in Indian enrolments after 2009. And China, unfortunately, has ramped up its hostility to our universities as part of its trade offensive, advising its students not to study here. Many, fortunately, are already enrolled and continuing their studies, including online.
While the states continue to prioritise the arrival of thousands of Australian citizens stranded overseas, and some reduce arrival caps during small COVID outbreaks, NSW is pushing ahead of other states with a bid to return up to 10,000 international students this year, Tim Dodd wrote last week. NSW has invited tenders from accommodation providers for 600 quarantine places for arriving students. For the sake of the tertiary education sector and jobs, other states should move in the same direction.
As reported on Monday, analysis by The Australian shows Southeast Asia (including Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia) accounted for 139,000 student enrolments in Australia’s higher education system last year and seven countries in South Asia, including Pakistan and Nepal, provided more than 119,000 enrolments. South America accounted for just over 75,000 students and Africa’s 23 countries 12,663. Those figures are far short of the 230,000 Chinese students and 148,000 Indians enrolled in our universities last year. But newcomers from diverse countries will broaden the base of a major export industry devastated by the pandemic. Universities and governments must be proactive in encouraging the trend. Our competitors in the UK and North America are doing so.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
South Australia steals a march	The Australian	Opening the border tapped into pent-up demand for travel Too few Australians have enjoyed the wonders of Flinders Chase National Park on Kangaroo Island, the Limestone Coast and its crater lakes, the Riesling Trail in the Clare Valley, the Flinders Ranges or the pristine beaches along the Fleurieu Peninsula close to McLaren Vale’s wineries. But more of us will discover them in coming months. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall has done his state and other Australians an important service in opening up to the people of NSW from midnight on Wednesday, in time for the school holidays. Those in the know realise South Australia has much to offer visitors beyond well-known destinations such as the Barossa Valley and the Adelaide Hills. In lifting the border to people from our most populous state, Mr Marshall has given SA’s underdeveloped and under-marketed tourism sector an important comparative advantage when Sydneysiders are still barred from Queensland, and Western Australia is off limits to everyone in NSW.
In June we reported that border closures and the clampdown on interstate travel were costing nearly 5000 jobs a week and shrinking the nation’s economic output by $84m a day. Commenting on the modelling by Lucid Economics for the Australian Tourism Industry Council, Scott Morrison said: “This is why borders should be opened up … There’s never been any advice which says they should be closed. That’s why this is so frustrating.” In an effective piece of competitive federalism, Mr Marshall has stolen a march on Queensland and WA. People planning holidays like to book ahead, and he has positioned his state to draw visitors over the long summer break. SA’s beaches are as good as any in the nation, without the seasonal humidity and stingers of the far north. Tourism operators in north Queensland who normally thrive in winter and in the September holidays know they have missed big opportunities this year. So have those in WA, where Premier Mark McGowan may or may not deign to open up by Christmas, the new year or in time for the Easter bunny. With Europe in the grip of an intense new wave of COVID-19 and fears about the virus leading to neural inflammation that is a key risk factor for Parkinson’s disease, Australians are unlikely to be able to holiday overseas until the middle of next year at the earliest.
Many of us are eager for fresh places to explore and Mr Marshall has tapped into a wealth of pent-up demand. The number of scheduled flights between Sydney and Adelaide is set to increase by at least fourfold, from several a week to several every day. As Susan Kurosawa and Penny Hunter report, in the hours after Mr Marshall’s announcement, Virgin Australia saw an increase of more than 700 per cent in flight searches and an even greater increase in bookings. Qantas, which has not operated Sydney-Adelaide services since July, will reintroduce a daily return service next week. Such steps are vital to the nation’s economic rebuilding and recovery. It also helps that South Australia is as safe as anywhere in the world at present. It has recorded only four COVID-19 cases this month, including a returned traveller. When the rest of the world starts to open up, that and the record of other states will resonate with prospective overseas visitors. Like all leaders, Mr Marshall is looking to stimulate his state’s economy. As he told David Penberthy, he is aiming for targeted spending measures to meet immediate job and investment challenges. Growing the tourism sector will create opportunities for business investment by small and larger enterprises and for infrastructure investment. The state’s tourism sector also needs better marketing. Compared with the Whitsundays, the snowfields, Byron Bay, Broome and even Uluru, South Australia’s attractions have been under-promoted. Post-COVID economic snapback is not a given. Well-targeted public spending will be essential, but recovery cannot be bought with taxpayers’ money. Smart decisions that build on comparative advantages will matter, as Mr Marshall has realised.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Premier must lead state to its full economic potential	The Australian	Opening the border to Sydney would be an important step
Since her surprise election as Queensland Premier in February 2015, Annastacia Palaszczuk has honed her political skills to emerge as Australia’s most successful female politician. We congratulate her on a significant victory on Saturday and wish her success in tackling the state’s myriad of challenges over the coming four years. Voters delivered a clear result. They largely bypassed minor parties, especially those of Pauline Hanson and Clive Palmer and found no reason to endorse the LNP which failed to offer them a clear, alternative economic plan. After erring on the side of caution and following doctor’s orders (those of Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young) to the letter, Ms Palaszczuk’s success in minimising the impact of COVID-19 stood her in good stead. The phrase “she’s kept us safe’’ was often heard among people with no political connections.
In the homespun style that appeals to so many Queenslanders, Ms Palaszczuk promised on Saturday night and on Sunday to “roll up the sleeves’’ and “get back to work on Monday’’. The state budget, to be delivered in the week beginning November 30, will be the priority. But for the sake of those who entrusted her with their support, including in regional Queensland, Ms Palaszczuk would do well to begin her third term by taking the time to have a long, hard think about how to best manage the pandemic in future.
On Sunday, Australia achieved zero new cases of coronavirus community transmissions for the first time since June 9. But the virus has not gone away, as millions of people in the northern hemisphere are finding to their detriment. Ms Palaszczuk again dug in on Sunday, insisting she would keep the state’s borders closed to Sydney and Victoria until at least the beginning of December. Standing firm is the mark of an effective leader. But so is knowing when to be flexible as circumstances change. With the nation all but COVID-free, Ms Palaszczuk needs to reconsider the impact of her decision on the airline, tourism and hospitality industries. As her predecessor Peter Beattie put it last week: “Open Queensland’s borders or bo broke.” Early December is too late for many families to make plans for summer holidays.
For the sake of holding control of the reins a little longer, when it is not necessary, Ms Palaszczuk risks costing many of her constituents, as well as the national economy, dearly. While case numbers remain low in Victoria and NSW, the case for a single national bubble is growing, as Health Minister Greg Hunt says. Until a safe vaccine is found, Queensland, like all states, will also need an effective strategy to manage spasmodic outbreaks of COVID. Border closures are not sustainable long term.
Whatever the parochial appeal of “fortress Queensland’’ north of the Tweed, it is our third-largest economy. And it is underperforming badly, with the highest unemployment in the nation and ballooning debt, even before COVID. With a four-year term and a comfortable working majority, Ms Palaszczuk and Treasurer Cameron Dick — a Cambridge graduate and former barrister, who has never been in opposition or on the backbench — have an opportunity to revive the economy. They can do so by adapting the best lessons of the Hawke, Keating, Goss and Beattie governments and enhancing conditions for private enterprise to flourish. The next four years hold much-needed economic promise. The Queen’s Wharf development will transform Brisbane’s CBD, the Cross River Rail, to be completed in late 2024 will revitalise inner suburbs. Ms Palaszczuk’s pledge to engage the Downer company to make 20 trains in the regional city of Maryborough aligns with the Morrison government’s policy to develop advanced manufacturing. In the previously marginal seat of Maryborough, voters rewarded Labor with an 11.2 per cent swing. While ready to act on the Morrison government’s advice to borrow at low interest rates for infrastructure, Mr Dick has also shown a welcome inclination to contain public sector recurrent spending.
For the LNP, the result provides much to consider. It would be shortsighted to blame the outcome on “pandemic protectionism’’, although it was a factor. The LNP failed to cut through, including in regional seats it targeted. Unlike the federal Coalition, it did not set out a clear, convincing plan for jobs, growth and budget policy. Leadership is a matter for LNP MPs. Policy was its Achilles heel. LNP campaign messages were sometimes confusing. And many conservative voters baulked at being asked to preference the Greens ahead of Labor. That tactic handed Greens radical Amy MacMahon former deputy premier Jackie Trad’s seat of South Brisbane. Had Labor’s base vote been weaker, LNP preferences could have opened the way for the Greens to form an alliance with the ALP in government. At least that proposition was avoided.
After spending about $8m, according to pundits, with saturation advertising, Clive Palmer won about 12,500 of 3.3 million votes at last count. That included 368 votes won by his wife, Anna, in Currumbin on the Gold Coast. It was surely the billionaire’s final political folly. Pauline Hanson’s One Nation also fell to a new nadir, losing half its support. The Greens’ “success’’ was limited to a handful of inner-urban seats, in line with trends in Sydney and Melbourne. Until Saturday, some Palaszczuk supporters regarded winning the 2015 and 2017 elections as the Premier’s main achievements. In winning a third, she is on course to overtake Wayne Goss and Peter Beattie as the state’s longest serving post-war Labor premier. She must now set about building a worthwhile legacy.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
RBA fosters confidence in ongoing real estate growth	The Australian	Optimism about property values can be an elixir for the economy After a year without overseas holidays, with limited domestic travel and few chances for other spending, many people who kept their jobs during the pandemic or who benefited from JobKeeper have the savings to take Australians’ enduring love affair with residential property to the next level. Given current conditions it looks like a good move.
Encouraged by some of the cheapest loans in history, buyers have the deposits to upgrade to better homes, or a weekender, or to invest in rental property. Doomsayers who predicted the pandemic would force a collapse in property values were far from the mark, we are pleased to report. Amid strict lending criteria, Australians signed up to $28.8bn in housing loans in January — 11 per cent more than in December and 44 per cent more than a year ago. Such eagerness to invest, and the 2.1 per cent surge in home prices last month — the sharpest monthly increase for 17 years — ­is a vote of confidence in the economy’s resilience and the strength of long-term recovery post COVID-19.
Borrowers have reason to feel reassured that the low interest rates will continue after Tuesday’s Reserve Bank board meeting. The board “remains committed to maintaining highly supportive monetary conditions” and will not lift the cash rate until inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range, RBA governor Philip Lowe said. For that to occur, wages growth and a return to a tighter labour market would be required. “The board does not expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest,” Dr Lowe said. Inflation, the board predicts, will be 1.25 per cent across this year and 1.5 per cent across next year. Recovery is stronger than expected and the fall in unemployment to 6.4 per cent is welcome. The board believes wage and price pressures will be subdued for several years. That said, as reported on Wednesday, many employers are reporting significant staff shortages and recruitment difficulties across the nation, despite 1.2 million people relying on JobSeeker.
Unlike previous real estate booms that were concentrated in Sydney, Melbourne and sometimes other cities, the current increase in values is being felt in all capitals and in many regions. Regional home prices surged 9.4 per cent in the year to February, the strongest annual growth rate in more than 16 years. It was driven by population shifts to more affordable areas, the working-from-home trend, younger residents staying put and not moving to the capital cities, and demand outstripping supply in some towns because of rural tourism booms. Areas such as the NSW south coast and semirural and hinterland centres are all in demand. But some markets at least 200km inland, such as Dubbo, western NSW and central and northwestern Queensland, are recording increases in values too. Interstate migration, rental returns and infrastructure improvements also drive markets.
Conversely, Patrick Commins reports, the end of the Morrison government’s $25,000 cash grant to build a new home sent dwelling construction approvals crashing by nearly 20 per cent in January. And approvals to build town­houses and apartments extended a downward trajectory that began in mid-2016 to the lowest level in nine years. Despite that reversal, approvals to build houses remained 38 per cent higher in January than a year earlier, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures reveal. As with all investments, recovery in new builds and apartments will depend on the needs and confidence of buyers.
Some will be encouraged that the process of borrowing is being made easier under reforms announced by Josh Frydenberg in September. The changes, designed to boost post-COVID recovery, should make accessing credit easier and quicker. Lenders will rely increasingly on the information provided by borrowers, replacing the practice of “lender beware” with a “borrower responsibility” principle. As Dr Lowe said in August, “the pendulum has swung a bit too far in blaming the bank if a loan goes bad because the bank didn’t understand the customer”. On Tuesday, he noted that lending standards remained sound “and it is important that they remain so in an environment of rising housing prices and low interest rates”. Banks and other lenders have a serious responsibility to ensure borrowers do not overextend themselves in a heated market. “Caveat emptor” remains paramount. In the long term, however, generations of Australians have learned that good property in a good location is a secure way to invest hard-earned savings.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
ALP needs rethink on Palestine	The Australian	Other nations should be encouraging the resumption of peace talks Those in the ALP campaigning for the party to “recognise Palestine as a state” have learned nothing from the electoral fate of British Labour under far-left former leader Jeremy Corbyn. His commitment to immediately recognise Palestinian statehood if he won government was far from the only reason British Labour suffered its worst defeat in almost 100 years in December 2019. But it contributed to the cataclysmic result. Michael Danby, the former Labor MP for Melbourne Ports, is correct when he says those seeking to put the Palestinian issue in the party platform ahead of China’s persecution of Tibetans, Uighurs, Hongkongers and Taiwan are “in cuckoo land”. Prioritising pro-Palestine references in the platform, he warned, would be “a step towards making Labor unelectable”. The misfocus, he said, in a provocative statement, is “not surprising when many of these elements behind this manoeuvre sing for Beijing’s supper’’.
Former Labor foreign minister Bob Carr has a different view: “Polls have consistently shown recognition of Palestine (is) supported by a majority of Australians.” Even if that were so, it would not alter the reality, as most major Western nations have concluded, that to recognise Palestine statehood at this time would be to affirm a fiction. Criteria for statehood set out in the 1933 Montevideo Convention for the Rights and Duties of States are clear. They are the minimum requirement in international law for recognition of a new state. “Palestine”, as presently constituted, does not have fixed, internationally accepted borders. Neither, crucially, does it have another vital criteria — a single, centralised government with the capacity to enter into relations with other states. There is a deep divide, and frequent serious armed conflict, between the secular Palestinian nationalist movement that nominally controls parts of the West Bank (represented by the PLO and Palestinian Authority) and the Hamas terrorist movement in Gaza. Without a Palestinian election since 2006, there is little prospect of a government emerging that could claim to exercise effective control over both the West Bank and Gaza. Mahmoud Abbas’s Palestinian Authority, the claimant to recognition, is demonstrably not such a government. Hence the refusal of the US, UK and Australia to accede to demands for recognition of Palestinian statehood. The ALP would be unwise to ignore reality.
As Liberal MP Dave Sharma, our former ambassador to Israel, said on Saturday, including a pro-Palestine statement in the ALP platform would be “the wrong call because it pre-empts a negotiated two-state solution, which has always been the policy of Australia”. Before the 2019 election, Bill Shorten, sensibly, resisted any commitment to unilaterally recognise Palestine, despite a resolution to that effect at the ALP’s national conference. Anthony Albanese should do the same and resist allowing Labor to become part of the brazen Palestinian strategy to achieve recognition through the back door rather than through negotiations with Israel over a two-state solution. Some 138 UN members have fallen for the Palestinian gambit and recognised what is a non-existent Palestinian state. There is no reason why the ALP should do the same when what is needed is for the Palestinians to be persuaded to end their repeated rejection of peace talks. As Mr Sharma says, what the ALP decides will not matter much in the Middle East. But it will show whether, on an issue crucial to Australia’s foreign policy and longstanding, bipartisan support for Israel, the party is in touch with reality.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
WHO fails in its responsibility	The Australian	Others should follow Morrison’s lead on China’s wet markets
Scott Morrison deserves strong international backing for his argument on Friday that both China and the World Health Organisation should “do something” about the wet markets where the catastrophic coronavirus started and “went around the world … we all know that’’. Nor is this the first time such a virus has emerged from these markets. “All this money that comes out of the UN and WHO … this is why we have to be quite strident about these things,” Morrison said.
The fetid markets reflect poorly on China’s pretensions to be a responsible member of the international community. The world cannot be expected to go on tolerating such risks.
However desirable the proposition, it is debatable whether China could be compelled legally to pay reparations to countries across the world for its deceitful mishandling of the pandemic, spawned in Wuhan. The conservative Henry Jackson Society in London argues that it should be. The society is proposing a claim under international law for $6.5 trillion, the amount that G7 countries alone have spent so far salvaging their devastated economies from the fallout of COVID-19.
Beijing, as it loses no opportunity to smugly pat itself on the back for what it claims is a sharp decline in case numbers in China, doubtless has other ideas. But it cannot deny the depth of anger towards it given its culpability for the crisis. Its wet markets bring together traditional livestock with a variety of other animals, including rats, bats, civet cats and pangolins used for food or medicine. Observers have described them as cesspits of blood, entrails, excrement and other waste that create conditions for disease to thrive and migrate from animals to humans. Zoonotic diseases in China have been responsible for other devastating outbreaks, including the 2003 SARS epidemic that emanated from Guangdong, and the 2009 “swine flu” virus.
Yet every previous undertaking by Beijing to “do something” about them has been meaningless. After the SARS outbreak, a temporary ban was imposed. In July 2003, the WHO declared the virus contained. In August, China lifted its ban on the markets.
The WHO, as Mr Morrison said, has an inescapable responsibility to deal with them. And the community of nations, as it seeks to overcome the virus that emanated in Wuhan, must now pressure Beijing to ban them for good, through forums such as the G20.
The WHO’s 1948 founding charter charged it with achieving “the highest possible level of health for all people”. It is failing to do so. Its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former Ethiopian health minister, has emerged as an apologist for Beijing’s handling of the outbreak. Even members of the WHO’s executive committee have spoken about the costs of China’s “reprehensible” obfuscation surrounding the extent of the outbreak in the early days. The organisation has also pointedly ignored the success of Taiwan, with a population of 24 million, in containing the virus to a reported 363 cases, with just five deaths.
After meeting Xi Jinping in Beijing early in the crisis, Dr Tedros praised China for “setting a new standard for outbreak control” and for its “openness to sharing information”. At the time, Chinese officials were arresting and punishing doctors who had raised the alarm about the virus for “spreading rumours”. Dr Tedros was unmoved, doubling down on his praise and declaring “China had bought the world time”. Precisely the opposite is true.The tally of coronavirus cases was more than 1.2 million on Sunday, with 65,000 deaths. China’s caseload is now exceeded by those of the US, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. Despite China attempting to lever the situation to its advantage by handing out aid, its credibility will remain in tatters until it closes its deadly wet markets.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Unlock gas to fire up economy	The Australian	Our abundant resources are a major competitive advantage
The decision by the NSW Independent Planning Commission to give Santos the green light for its $3.6bn coal-seam gas project is timely for two reasons. First, it comes as government and industry are seeking to kickstart productivity, including the expansion of manufacturing, as the national economy emerges from the pandemic. Second, as the Australian Energy Market Operator warned in March, NSW, Victoria and South Australia could experience gas shortages on peak demand days from 2023 as production from existing fields begins to dwindle. In winter, average demand for gas in southern states is three times higher than in summer.
In March last year, Australian Competition & Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims warned that the high cost of gas posed an imminent threat to east coast manufacturers, making them internationally uncompetitive and increasing the likelihood they would wind up or relocate their operations. On Wednesday, Alberto Calderon, chief executive of Orica, which manufactures explosives and blasting equipment for the mining industry, noted Australia was “the only major gas-producing country which doesn’t ensure adequate supply at competitive prices for its own domestic market”.
That indictment on years of energy policy failures and green tape needs to end now. The Narrabri project has taken 3½ years to approve, which is too slow. It has been touted as being able to supply 50 per cent of NSW’s gas needs via a pipeline linking into the existing Moomba-to-Sydney pipeline. Santos has accepted all 134 conditions imposed by the IPC and will seek final environmental approval from the Morrison government. If the government is true to its word about cutting green tape, it should move swiftly. And the APA Group will push ahead with a new $500m pipeline to transport gas to customers.
Critics of the gas project question its potential to poison the Gunnedah Basin and surrounding aquifers because of underground drilling, threatening agriculture. That concern needs to be addressed through the environmental protection process. But aside from the usual Greens and Lock the Gate activists, doubts about the project have been raised from a different direction.
NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean regards the project as “a big gamble”, Perry Williams reported on Tuesday. Mr Kean said gas might prove a poor investment in the long term and he pondered whether demand could be satisfied through liquefied natural gas import terminals. “Probably, so why would they do it?” Mr Kean said.
In light of Australia’s looming gas shortages and the threat they pose to manufacturing and jobs, especially in the current parlous economic climate, it makes more sense that a gas superpower such as Australia use its reserves to cut power prices and industry costs and play a role in the transition to cleaner energy. This is why The Australian has argued consistently in favour of the states unlocking their restrictions on gas exploration and production. A move by the Victorian government earlier this year to lift a ban on onshore exploration, while welcome, will not come into effect until July next year, meaning any supply from sources such as the Otway Basin are unlikely to be developed in time to ease the looming crisis. Despite the nation’s abundant and largely untapped reserves, the Turnbull government deemed it necessary in 2017 to impose the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism to direct LNG exporters to divert supplies to the local market if a shortfall is forecast. It is in place until 2023 and is a reminder that Australian customers need greater supply. There is also a lucrative international market to be tapped, as Queensland LNG suppliers are doing. Better late than never, the Narrabri approval is a step in the right direction for NSW and the nation.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Old year ending and 2021 to start on challenging note	The Australian	Our communities owe immense gratitude to healthcare workers Few if any of the Twitterati demanding that NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian impose a “big government” COVID-19 response earn their living in the industries that would be hardest hit by that approach — retail, hospitality, tourism and services. The announcement on Wednesday of 18 additional cases in NSW after 17,000 tests is a serious concern, including the emergence of six cases among three families in Croydon in Sydney’s inner west. It is especially worrying that the virus has been found as far afield from the northern beaches as Wollongong and Katoomba. Victoria has recorded three community coronavirus transmissions on Wednesday, bringing to an end its two-month run of no new locally acquired cases. The cases are believed to be linked to the NSW outbreak.
While some are calling for a short, sharp lockdown in NSW that hopefully would contain the spread, others want the COVID-19 vaccine rushed out. Both options would entail disadvantages. In the earlier stages of the pandemic, and again in recent weeks, the NSW contact tracing system has proved its efficacy time and again. At third stage, it remains the health service’s most potent weapon. The New Year’s Eve restrictions announced on Wednesday, limiting household visits across Greater Sydney to five people and outdoor gatherings to 30, are appropriate. Or as Ms Berejiklian said: “Our preferred advice is that people just stay home for New Year’s Eve.” Inviting citizens to take responsibility for themselves and their communities, the antithesis of the nanny state, shows commendable maturity.
Restrictions on visitors to residential aged-care facilities in Greater Sydney are locked in, sensibly, until January 7, with staff wearing masks. At this stage, the third Test between Australia and India is scheduled to be played in front of a 50 per cent capacity crowd at the Sydney Cricket Ground on January 7. Further restrictions are not justified at present but may prove necessary. As Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says, nine days is a long time in COVID times. On the cusp of 2021, as we contemplate how to manage a pandemic none of us had heard about 12 months ago, and as we look forward to safe, effective vaccines, Australians can take heart from the position we are in. To date we have suffered 909 deaths, mainly as a result of Victoria’s hotel quarantine bungle, from about 28,300 cases nationally.
The magnitude of the global problem is hard to comprehend. Coronavirus will claim about 1.8 million lives and has infected about 82 million people this year. In the US, almost 20 million people — as many as the combined populations of our three largest states, NSW, Victoria and Queensland — have been infected by COVID. More than 338,000 Americans, equivalent to the population of the Sunshine Coast, have died from the virus. Britain’s caseload of 2.4 million is equivalent to the populations of South Australia and Tasmania combined. Intensive care beds in many British hospitals are full, leaving some patients to be treated in ambulances in loading docks. While the British economy is crippled and London’s busiest areas resemble ghost towns, further restrictions are pending. More virulent COVID strains have made the situation more dangerous in Britain, and a new variant also has been detected in the US and Latin America. The predicament of many other nations reinforces the need to be cautious about the spread of the NSW clusters. NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant is concerned there may be “unrecognised spread” and admits health officials are struggling to get a grip on the outbreak. As Ms Berejiklian says, her government is prepared to act swiftly if the situation deteriorates and the health advice changes. After dominating national life in 2020, COVID-19 and its aftermath will again be a major challenge in 2021.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
One word makes a difference	The Australian	Our national anthem should draw the nation together Regardless of whether our ancestors have been here for 60,000 years or if they arrived in convict chains or as postwar immigrants, Australians can take pride in our ancient land. The classical civilisations of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome are recent by comparison.
Without indulging the destructive cancel culture, the suggestion by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and others that we change the words “young and free” in the first verse of our national anthem to “one and free” has much to recommend it. Dated from the First Fleet in 1788 we are a young country, and younger still from Federation in 1901. But it is understandable that the word young leaves many Indigenous people, whose roots in Australia date back into the Dreamtime, feeling uncomfortable.
The words of Advance Australia Fair are not set in stone. A small change — a single word — could be made with a minimum of fuss. As Chris Kenny writes, the original lyric “Australia’s sons let us rejoice” has seamlessly given way to “Australians all let us rejoice”.
National symbols matter. They engender pride and patriotism. And “one” is who we are. One nation, one people — Australians — on our very old land, building on the courage and legacies of earlier generations. Such unity is something to sing about. Freeman underlined that oneness in her post-race lap of honour in 2000 when she carried the national and the Aboriginal flags in Sydney, during one of the nation’s proudest and most unforgettable moments. This is a conversation worth having at dinner tables, at barbecues, in classrooms and in the chambers of federal parliament.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
A helping hand for Indonesia	The Australian	Our northern neighbour is struggling with the pandemic The Morrison government’s provision of a $1.37bn standby loan to Indonesia sends a strong signal that despite our own economic challenges, Australia remains firmly committed to helping neighbours in need. Under pandemic pressure, there is a natural tendency of nations to turn inward. But a modest contribution to stability in the Asia-Pacific makes good humanitarian, economic and strategic sense.
The region’s biggest economy is battling a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases. Last week, it went into its first recession in 22 years after its economy contracted 3.49 per cent in the September quarter, following a 5.32 per cent slump in the three months to June. There could hardly be a better or more timely demonstration of Australian goodwill and the closeness of our bilateral ties than the provision of the loan facility.
It is also, as Ben Packham reports on Tuesday, a reflection of the closeness of the strong personal relationship between Scott Morrison and President Joko Widodo. Australia’s agreement to the loan follows a $1.37bn loan to Indonesia by the Chinese government-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and a $660m loan from Japan, both intended to help Jakarta deal with the pandemic’s impact. According to a Lowy Institute report, Indonesia faces one of the most difficult outlooks in Asia. With 438,000 COVID-19 cases so far and almost 14,540 deaths, its battle against the virus is uncertain. Its reliance on foreign financing has left it exposed to capital flight and “struggling to fund the fiscal response needed to keep its economy (and society) afloat”. “Without enough fiscal support,” the report warns, “the economic damage from the virus will be far deeper and longer lasting — setting back its economic rise, leaving more people in poverty and weakening its foundations for ongoing stability.” Australia previously provided emergency financing to Indonesia during the 1996 Asian financial crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2013 “taper tantrum” panic that swept global markets after the US Federal Reserve announced it would wind back its policy of quantitative easing. It is right that we should again offer a helping hand to a neighbour whose stability and continued economic growth is vital to our own strategic interests. Indonesia should not be left with no alternative but further exposure to the risks that come with more money from Beijing.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Queensland’s prosperity path	The Australian	Our third-largest state economy is too big to be left to fail
Annastacia Palaszczuk’s prospects of setting our third-largest state economy back on to the path to prosperity depend on her ability to capitalise on the departure of Jackie Trad, her former deputy and treasurer. Ms Trad’s dominant Left faction has been influential in draining the energy from Queensland’s once-enterprising and winning business culture. But the promotion of Cameron Dick from the Right to Treasurer and the pragmatic Kate Jones to State Development, as well as Tourism and Innovation, gives Ms Palaszczuk, the leader of the Right, the opportunity to break free of the big-government approach that has been her administration’s hallmark since February 2015. That dead-end approach, in no small measure, stemmed from Ms Trad and the trade unions that have called the tune for too long north of the Tweed.
Queenslanders, as Joh Bjelke-Petersen and Peter Beattie understood, have never been averse to a bit of state jingoism. Ms Palaszczuk’s homespun “putting Queenslanders first” rhetoric and promises of her “permanent appointments to my new cabinet” and concentration on job creation strike the right note. Achieving the turnaround will be harder than promising it, however, when facing the prospect of $100bn in state debt within two years.
In rebooting their economic and fiscal strategies, which must be their priority, Ms Palaszczuk, Mr Dick and Ms Jones would be wise to study the approach of Queensland’s most fiscally responsible and competent right-wing Labor government of the past 30 years. From December 1989 to February 1996, Wayne Goss and his treasurer, Keith DeLacy, employed an economic strategy reminiscent of the best of the Hawke-Keating years. It was based on low taxes and sound financial management. “Market enhancement”, as Goss described it in 1992, was designed to create an optimal environment in which business could operate efficiently, with minimal government interference. It freed up government to concentrate on areas in which markets prove inadequate.
Those principles, Mr DeLacy wrote in The Australian last year, were encapsulated in a “fiscal trilogy” to repel “wanton spenders”. It included fully funding long-term liabilities such as superannuation; funding social capital assets such as schools and hospitals from recurrent revenues and borrowing only for commercial assets that could service their debt; and maintaining low taxes. The mantra worked. Queensland’s real gross state product grew by an average 4.4 per cent in real terms, Mr DeLacy recalled, while growth for the rest of the nation was 1.9 per cent. Queensland also generated 55 per cent of new jobs in Australia; the state’s AAA credit rating was enhanced.
Decades on, years of loose spending, especially by the current government on public sector wages, have weakened Queensland, before the economic ravages of coronavirus. In February, Queensland Auditor-General Brendan Worrall warned the state government it risked not being able to meet its operating costs with revenue alone unless it increased revenue or cut spending growth, which rose 11 per cent between 2016-17 and 2018-19. And in December Ms Trad announced $5bn would be taken from the public sector defined benefit superannuation fund to create a debt offset account, to be invested by the Queensland Investment Corporation.Against that background, but mainly on principle because governments’ role is not to pick winners (which often turn out to be losers), the bid for a stake in Virgin is not in Queenslanders’ best interests. Mr Dick has told the QIC to look at buying into the airline, which is in voluntary administration, $7bn in debt. Reviving Virgin would help the beleaguered tourism sector. There is no shortage of investors lining up. The state would do better, as Labor’s Peter Beattie did in 1998, to focus on industry strategies to kickstart investment and jobs. Rather than buying assets, Queensland should be seeking maximum returns leasing or selling government assets. The debt handicapping the state must be addressed by both political sides before the October 31 election.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Tech behemoths pilfering news content must pay up	The Australian	Our vibrant democracy needs strong, sustainable media
The upcoming closure of Australian Associated Press — the nation’s news wire — after 85 years of good service needs to be understood by the Morrison government as a serious and overdue wake-up call. The closure of the agency that has been the “first responder” of Australian journalism since Joseph Lyons was prime minister and Don Bradman was batting should also concern every citizen with an interest in politics, finance, the courts, coronavirus, national security, the environment, travel and the world in general. AAP has been known for its timely, factual and comprehensive reporting.
Those with most to lose from its closure, ironically, are the naive, complacent individuals, who blithely say they’re happy “to get all the news from social media” and would never think to pay for quality news coverage.
What they get on social media, in reality, is a skewed mishmash of content pilfered from newspapers and broadcasters, and filtered through the tech giants’ opaque echo chambers. Across time, such a pattern will produce a less informed society, less engaged in our vibrant democracy.
On Wednesday, AAP chairman Campbell Reid, who is also a News Corp Australia ­senior executive, pinpointed the reason the wire service was closing. The detrimental impact of digital platforms on media companies had reached a tipping point, he said. The unfettered market power of Google and Facebook and the significant imbalance in bargaining power had devastated media business models. Tech giants were taking and not paying for vast swaths of content produced by media companies and using it to generate billions of advertising dollars. “That is at the heart of why AAP is closing. No one should kid themselves otherwise. Until the platforms start paying publishers for their journalism instead of distributing it for free for their own profit then we are going to, sadly, see a lot more bad news in the media sector.” Last year, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission made 23 recommendations to address the growing market power and anti-competitive behaviour of tech giants in Australia. Taken together, Google and Facebook have a market capitalisation larger than Australia’s GDP. The ACCC, in an eminently sensible recommendation, said they should share the revenue they reaped for using news stories created by Australian publishers, after negotiations to be conducted “fairly, reasonably and transparently”. In response, the Morrison government has said the parties must negotiate and if they cannot reach a deal by November the government will impose a code. The closure of AAP shows how urgent the situation has become.
The root of AAP’s financial problem is that too few media companies have opted to subscribe to its services. On Thursday, The Guardian and the journalists union, the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance, peddled false claims that News Corp Australia and Nine Entertainment wanted AAP shut down to hurt smaller rivals that relied on the wire service for news coverage. The Guardian’s claim, on which the union’s statement appeared to be based, is self-serving hypocrisy. The Guardian, Mr Reid disclosed, was “one of the very companies that slashed the amount it was prepared to pay for AAP. It is one of the organisations whose decisions have contributed to the closure of AAP.” Instead of engaging in such claptrap, The Guardian and the union need to face facts. The world’s creative industries, including serious news companies, are being “eaten alive by tech platforms profiting from other people’s content”, as Mr Reid said.Too few of those clicking on to social media and taking what is dished up as “news” at face value realise the dynamics or the dangers. The situation is akin to a global conglomerate commandeering flour, sugar, milk, cocoa and other ingredients for nothing, mass-producing biscuits, raking in the profits and returning nothing to the producers. It would never happen in other industries but it has in news, such is the power of the behemoths. The government, with the nation’s long-term interest at heart, must hold them to account.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Time to redouble vaccine efforts	The Australian	Oversight of the national program needs a shot in the arm Key reasons to support the federal government’s measured timetable for the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine included the luxury of learning from the mistakes of others, allowing time to get proper systems in place and to get the messaging right to encourage participation. This makes Health Minister Greg Hunt’s admission that two elderly nursing home residents in Brisbane were given four times the recommended dose of vaccine by a doctor who had not completed the mandatory training all the more extraordinary and disappointing. For a community exposed to conflicting messages from social media and sensationalist reporting about vaccines, the mess-up so early in the program is unwelcome to say the least. The government needs to be using its resources to demonstrate the vaccine is safe and effective, and that it is in control. Instead, the risk is that the message getting through is one of bureaucratic incompetence and lack of proper oversight. That said, things should not be blown out of proportion.
To Mr Hunt’s credit, he has been open with the facts rather than let the news leak out to become a bigger scandal than it is already. There was a breakdown in process, with Mr Hunt admitting the doctor had not completed the training. But the mistake was picked up quickly and those involved are being monitored closely in case of adverse reactions. These are not expected given results from trials that included bigger doses than those now recommended and similar mistakes overseas.
Nonetheless, with research confirming that scepticism about the vaccine is still a significant factor in the community, the federal government can ill afford more mistakes. Crucial to the rollout will be the preparedness of state governments and provincial media to allow space for the commonwealth to succeed in an area traditionally controlled by the states. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was quick to blame the Morrison government and demand the Prime Minister call a national cabinet meeting. The federal government is relying on the vaccines to break the cycle of state border closures and lockdowns that have proved popular for premiers but debilitating for the economy. As editor-at-large Paul Kelly wrote on Wednesday, many state-based media outlets have given strong support for state provincialism. The question now, he says, is whether that narrative will change to documenting the dimensions of the vaccine rollout or will it focus on problems and alarms. Events in Brisbane provide an ominous signpost to what the answer may be.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Putting to rest wild ghosts and myths of the Dismissal	The Australian	Palace letters show John Kerr plotted alone in the 1975 crisis
Australia’s 18th governor-general, Sir John Kerr, was proud and vain, a dangerous schemer who put himself at the centre of the single most dramatic event in our political history. The long-secret letters between Buckingham Palace and Kerr reveal he did not give the Queen advance notice of his decision to dismiss Gough Whitlam on November 11, 1975. The palace letters, made public on Tuesday by the National Archives of Australia, show a man who was busy, indiscreet and over the top in his communications with Sir Martin Charteris, the private secretary to the sovereign. The 212 missives, over 3½ years, provide a clear window into one troubled soul and a tumultuous episode, one that still divides. That the public was denied this material for so long is itself a scandal, a reminder timely disclosure is the only antidote to myth and false conspiracy theories.
As Paul Kelly and Troy Bramston observed five years ago when their book, The Dismissal: In the Queen’s Name, was published, the events of 1975 see historical reality and myth in a complex interaction. Each generation reinterprets its meaning. Kelly and Bramston noted three astonishing myths about the constitutional and political crisis: that the Dismissal was really a conspiracy driven from the US by the CIA; that the Queen and Buckingham Palace were “in the know” and Kerr’s co-agents in the Dismissal; and that Whitlam was actually going to prevail on November 11 and had his triumph stolen from him by Kerr. By the 40th anniversary, the authors concluded the available evidence was the CIA wasn’t responsible, the palace didn’t know and Whitlam was not the thwarted victor on November 11.
Yet the ghosts would not rest, in part due to Whitlam’s biographer, Jenny Hocking, and the abiding rage of the Whitlamites, who came of age in the 1960s and for whom Gough was, still is, a saviour. His star power and passion even seeped into the next generation, sweating in the Oils mosh, too young to witness a tough Gough hitting the rough but knowing “Uncle Sam and John were quite enough”. Professor Hocking propagated the view palace officials gave “an unqualified green light to Kerr’s dismissal of Whitlam”. She argued the Queen was “aware” Kerr was considering dismissal and did not dissuade him. This explosive view contradicted the accounts of Kerr and palace officials; Whitlam never claimed the Queen was a party to the putsch.
The evidence was as small as the claim was big. Professor Hocking’s dogged search for more, seeking to gain access to the palace letters, went to the High Court. Lower courts deemed the letters were personal and confidential. In May, the High Court ruled the letters were commonwealth records. Now that we have them, there is no smoking gun, no flicker of green light. “I decided to take the step I took without informing the Palace in advance … it was better for Her Majesty not to know,” Kerr wrote to Charteris on November 11. Kerr said that under the Constitution, the responsibility was his but he had a duty to inform the Queen immediately. In reply, the palace thanked Kerr for keeping the Queen out of the decision-making in the crisis. A week after the event, Kerr told the palace the reason he didn’t give Whitlam warning was because he wanted to protect the monarchy in Australia. As Kelly notes after the release of the letters, the plot was hatched at Yarralumla, not in London: “The Australian public and the republic cause are not enhanced by the creation of false conspiracy stories about the palace.” Only Labor diehards could find intellectual vindication or solace in the odd flourishes from Kerr in the letters, his bonhomie and gossip, amid the foul air of obsequiousness. But there are important and detailed exchanges between Kerr and the palace about options to resolve the parliamentary deadlock over supply, the reserve powers, dissolving the parliament and the possibility of dismissal. A week before the denouement, Charteris told Kerr that while the reserve powers of the crown “have not been used for many years”, he had no doubt they existed. The Queen’s private secretary also issued a vital warning: the powers should be used only as a last resort. The history is now clearer but may never be settled. Our democracy was sent to the brink by Kerr, yet no lives were lost and the system recovered. Still, the lesson of 1975 endures: our institutions and constitutional powers must not be pushed towards breaking point.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Campus reform, not a bailout	The Australian	Pandemic disruption is a chance to rethink higher education On Wednesday we reported the striking image of Australia’s research system facing a “ground zero” scenario without the overseas student fees that subsidise fundamental scientific and medical investigation. But higher education is not the only sector facing a painful, post-pandemic adjustment. This crisis is an opportunity to refocus on what is indispensably valuable.
International education has been a remarkable commercial achievement, in part explained by the lure of migration. But it would be foolhardy to plan as if there will be a speedy return of this $37.6bn export industry, not just because mass student arrivals are unlikely without a vaccine and China, our main inbound market, seems intent upon punishing us economically. Those rivers of fee income came with risks. Universities had been warned for years of their overreliance on the Chinese student market. There have been troubling questions about academic standards and a distortion in institutional priorities.
Universities had an incentive to oversell the skills of graduates who became migrants, but many have brought dynamism and adaptability to the workforce, sometimes in jobs that locals will not do. The story of this country is one of migration enlarging opportunity and prosperity. By all means we should encourage universities to recruit overseas students but on a more modest scale with careful attention to academic quality and diversity of source markets. This contribution to job-creation and living standards is obviously desirable. But the Morrison government is right to resist a sector-specific bailout, especially when higher education is in need of reform. We need education and training more sharply focused on the national interest as we enter the first recession in three decades. The “knowledge economy” argument for dramatically expanded higher education has been overplayed. In university administration, there is waste, inefficiency and empire building, alongside skill and hard work. Casual academics, the grunts of the empire, have already begun to lose their livelihoods yet vice-chancellors remain overpaid and they preside over bloated social engineering bureaucracies at odds with academic values.
The national cabinet should get serious about a long-overdue revival in technical education, consistent with the rediscovered need for economic self-reliance. And the country desperately needs rigorous, decluttered school education, without which higher-level reforms in the system will stumble.
It should not be a goal to get through this downturn with today’s university model intact. Estimates by education experts suggest seven of 38 institutions are high financial risks as they burn through cash and reserves. It’s far from clear that we should fund so many look-alike mass universities, rather than encourage experiments in scale, technology and specialisation. Why not a health and medical university closely linked with commercialisation? Or a publicly funded, teaching-only liberal arts college that has scholarly aims higher than the critical theory activism churned out by sandstone universities? In seeking a bailout, the university lobby tells a familiar story of the social and economic value it represents. Certainly we should seek to preserve world-class research infrastructure and talent. But there is more at stake, such as the ideal structure and integrity of higher education. And the Drew Pavlou affair at the University of Queensland is a reminder that ordinary people often grasp the liberal purpose of a university better than those in charge do.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Looking out for the most vulnerable in community	The Australian	Pandemic is an opportunity to show true Australian spirit
Australia in isolation — our borders closed, returned travellers and new arrivals in 14-day self-quarantine — is a daunting work in progress. Social distancing has entered the lexicon, with gatherings of more than 500 people scrubbed. Anzac Day services and agricultural shows have been halted. Scott Morrison says the comparator to the coronavirus pandemic is the Spanish flu of 100 years ago. This time, however, the states and territories are better co-ordinated and resourced in the national response. Anyone aged under 75 will be tempted to think this is what life during wartime must be like. Still, the Prime Minister emphasised in back-to-back morning TV and radio interviews on Monday that life goes on. “The shops remain open, the trains still run, the phones still work, the lights still switch on,” he said. “This is not a physical disaster where you’ve had a cyclone or something like that.” People, however, are a little bewildered at the shutdown, feeling swamped by the dislocations and the accumulation of dilemmas about what to do to limit the risks of being infected, beyond the commonsense precautions of handwashing, sneezing properly, not shaking hands and the like. These are early days but the restrictions could last for six months, perhaps a little more or a little less, according to Mr Morrison. The strategy, driven by medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, is to slow the rate of infection — “flatten the curve” — which allows the health system to better respond; that reduces the risk to the elderly and saves lives. The main goal is to stop medical facilities being overwhelmed, given the number of COVID-19 infections is now doubling every few days.
For many parents and some medical experts, the decision not to close schools is perplexing. Independent schools are moving ahead of state authorities with closures, putting online learning environments to the test. Even if assemblies and sports are cancelled, parents wonder how can it be prudent to have hundreds of students massed in corridors at the change of lessons? It’s counterintuitive, but officials say closing schools could create more problems than solutions. Mr Morrison t on Monday said the impact on younger people is actually much less than for the rest of the population. But if school students were forced home, they would need to be cared for, perhaps by older Australians, their grandparents, he said. “That is not a particularly good idea at the moment. And it would also take, potentially, nurses and others out of the workforce when we need them right now,” the Prime Minister said.
Right now, the highest priority must be protecting the health of the most vulnerable in our community and easing the effects of the disruption to food supplies and other essential services to them. To this end, the major supermarkets have announced they will introduce special shopping hours for the elderly and disabled. Retailers have been swamped by home delivery requests, as well as having their shelves stripped of items; they’re putting on a reserve army of casuals to cope. The run on supermarkets, however, is an opportunity for neighbours to step up and help socially isolated people. It may have sounded trite a few weeks ago when Mr Morrison suggested to take around a curry to rural folks who don’t have access to Uber Eats. But his advice on Sunday to drop off a casserole to those in need, as an act of kindness, suits the times. As well as exercising restraint in the grocery shopping stakes.
More delicate to design will be the imminent restrictions on aged-care facilities, which the national cabinet will consider on Tuesday evening. Britain is planning a dramatic four-month mass quarantine of everyone over 70 in the most drastic measure yet unveiled in the fight against COVID-19. UK nursing homes and other aged-care centres face being locked down for the same period. Mr Morrison has flagged there will be a “fairly significant restriction on visitation to people in nursing homes”. He said measures would be sensitively implemented, given families would possibly be seeing elderly relatives for the last time. But he explained the prime goal was “to lessen the broader risk for people in these facilities”. Undoubtedly, amid distress, it will be a difficult balance to strike.
The health of indigenous people, especially those living in remote areas and suffering high rates of chronic disease, is another priority. Northern Territory authorities have banned non-essential travel into bush communities and advised residents not to leave. The draconian-sounding measures are aimed at limiting the spread of the virus and stopping doctors in the already strained system from making life-and-death decisions. Indigenous leaders are rightly demanding more medicines, masks, equipment and clinicians be allocated to these communities.Protecting our most vulnerable people invariably requires harsher restrictions on movement and services, as well as more dedicated resources. But it will also call for displays of Australian spirit, acts of kindness to strangers, self-control and patience. The way we interact with Nanna and Pop, for instance, may change for the next several months: less face time and more FaceTime. Try to look out for the elderly in your street or apartment building. As the Prime Minister has said, our job in the coming days, weeks and months is to work together to slow the spread of the virus. For those of us who are more healthy, we have a duty to protect the most vulnerable. As a US president once said, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country, your local community, your fellow Australian.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Getting back to school will help vulnerable kids most	The Australian	Pandemic offers a chance to revamp teaching and learning
Out of the coronavirus misery, there have been a few bright spots, such as building national resilience and a renewed focus on essentials. COVID-19 has produced a “teachable moment”, as they say in education, an opportunity for adapting to new modes of teaching and learning. That’s been enabled by technology, with experienced teachers skilling up on wonderful tools. For digital natives, who roam and soak up content platform to platform, the education system is finally evolving from the models of last century to meet the world students will be looking to thrive in. After the crisis, classrooms won’t be the same, nor will community expectations. We are at an embryonic stage in a brave new world of education. Right now, however, we need to get students and their teachers back to school as soon as possible.
Five separate studies released by the federal Education Department on Monday reveal online education is holding back students, with vulnerable children and those in early years facing severe long-term impacts. Literacy and numeracy results are set to slide by one-sixth if pupils are kept at home for six months. More than one million at-risk students face social, emotional and behavioural setbacks. Some Year 5 students would effectively lose six weeks of learning in reading and almost 11 weeks in numeracy if schools failed to reopen this year. The University of Tasmania’s Peter Underwood Centre found the shutdown was especially hard on already disengaged students and those from non-English-speaking backgrounds. Many families simply lack the physical space, technology and other resources to support home schooling, while less-educated parents faced even tougher challenges.
Of the 3.9 million students studying across the nation, 20 per cent come from low-socio-economic households. A study by Melbourne University’s Graduate School of Education warned that those living in poverty would have “exacerbated risk”, finding it more difficult to catch up after schools returned. It’s likely the number of vulnerable people will increase. The Centre for International Research on Education Systems pointed to increased stress and behavioural issues for at-risk kids, who would struggle due to lack of teacher supervision. Another study foreshadowed a widening gulf between education haves and have-nots; many parents do not have the skills or experience to support home learning. Yet we have the power to reverse or ameliorate disturbing trends.
The medical advice to national cabinet is clear: students should return to school. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy declared classrooms posed no risk of spreading COVID-19, adding there was no need for students to observe the 1.5m social distancing rules. Scott Morrison is also eager to have children in school, and is nudging teachers to get back to the classroom. The danger to teachers was not there, the Prime Minister noted, but in the staffroom. Besides, bus drivers and supermarket staff were showing up each day despite the risk of infection. Education Minister Dan Tehan has waved a $3.3bn carrot for Catholic and independent schools, who educate 1.4 million students. Those schools will get fast-track access to vital funds if they open campuses immediately and return to at least 50 per cent classroom teaching before the end of May.
Teachers’ unions, as well as a recalcitrant Victorian government, see Mr Tehan’s move as provocative, if not “bribery”. It’s also dividing schools and school systems, with rebel groups in regional areas asking to be allowed to conduct their own risk assessments in areas without a COVID-19 case in the past month. As Rebecca Urban reported on Wednesday, a powerful network of Victorian private schools is demanding discretion to reopen campuses. As Mr Morrison says, it is up to each state to follow the advice of its health chief and premier. As with a range of restrictions, what’s right for Ballarat, Bonython, Burnie or Bunbury may not fit Balmain or Bowen Hills.
Yet there is a risk students in state systems could be left months behind in learning by not following suit with non-government schools that reopen due to Canberra’s financial incentives. Would state education officials block schools from reopening? It’s possible, but imagine the outcry and confusion. That may not be all that different from the current jumble. NSW, for instance, is making a staggered return from May 11. Parents in Queensland are getting conflicting views, but the government has not committed to a decision on reopening schools until after May 15. Victoria’s advice is students who can learn from home must do so for the duration of term two, even though the state’s top health adviser said he was open to opening schools before the end of the term. Both South Australia and Western Australia are encouraging students back to class.We understand unions are worried about members’ wellbeing. Even at the best of times, classrooms can be germ hothouses and personal space is at a premium. Schools should use common sense in how they assign older and illness-prone teachers. Students in senior years must be a priority. On the balance of risks, reopening schools is necessary to return to normal, for families and the nation. Providing peace of mind for educators will be the news that key medical safeguards are falling into place: broad testing, quick tracing and capacity for rapid response to outbreaks. With the virus suppressed a revamped economy is in prospect. On the sunny side of the curve, we see the possibility of a rebirth for learning, teaching and prospering, as long as we take the right lessons from this crisis.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Shifting sands in school choices	The Australian	Parents are voting with their feet for a better education for children
As the Catholic Church marks the bicentenary of the founding of the nation’s first Catholic school, by Irish priest John Therry in Parramatta, the sector has substantial achievements to celebrate. From the enrolment of 31 children in Parramatta in 1821, the sector grew to educate millions of Australians. For about 140 years, it did so without state aid, through the generosity of the faithful and the efforts of priests, brothers and nuns who worked for little more than their keep. The sector now educates one in five Australian students and is heavily involved in preschool and university education. In many places, it led the way in after-school care.
As Rebecca Urban reports, only 63 per cent of students in Catholic schools identify as Catholic. The 37 per cent who do not include other Christians, non-Christians and, increasingly, those with no religious affiliation. In some suburban Catholic schools, non-Catholics outnumber their Catholic schoolmates.
Motivations for parents’ school choices vary. Among other reasons, non-Catholic families select Catholic schools for the chance to access a system in which the best performing secondary schools offer a top-quality education at about half the price of some elite independent schools. Escaping controversial, ideologically driven programs such as Safe Schools in the state sector is another factor. So is the perception of Catholic schools providing better discipline and insisting on better behaviour. Giving children the chance to grow up with a knowledge of Australia’s Christian heritage is also a factor. More broadly, the mobility of families between sectors reflects the dissatisfaction and anxiety of many parents with the nation’s education system overall, despite outstanding school facilities and the investment of billions of taxpayers’ dollars. Parents increasingly are willing to look further afield, pay the price and take a leap of faith to improve their children’s learning.
For most school sectors, there is a flip side to parents shopping around. In 200 Years Young, the pastoral letter released by the Catholic bishops to mark the anniversary, there is a telling paragraph: “In some parts of the country, many better-off Catholic students have been lost to other-than-Catholic independent schools. Government schools and other Christian schools have become rivals for our students in the education ecosystem.” That acknowledges the exodus of some Catholic families from the church’s system, despite its success.
The trend has been evident for decades, including among some dedicated Catholics who reject postmodern religious education and worry about plummeting mass attendances among the young. Pre-COVID, these were 6 per cent officially, but far lower in some areas. Other Catholic parents opt for secular schools because they are indifferent or hostile to the church, or they are more impressed with selective state, independent or other schools. The bishops acknowledge that financial stress has prompted some Catholic families to go, as has disillusionment, they admit, over the child sexual abuse crisis. Meanwhile, as they point out, “many other-than-Catholic families entrust their children to our schools”. They also want to enrol greater numbers of students who are Indigenous, refugees, disabled or disadvantaged. The bishops’ statement hints at some soul searching. Ensuring schools are “truly Catholic in their identity and life” and foster high levels of “religious literacy”, they say, requires that “we retain a ‘critical mass’ of Catholic students and staff”. Religious education must help students “integrate faith, culture and life”. The call for closer ties between parishes and schools, which many will welcome, comes, ironically, just as some dioceses have severed the authority of parish priests over local schools. The analysis by those responsible for 20 per cent of schools highlights the value of choice. Driven by concerns over standards, culture wars and the green, political activism that is pushed in some schools in some sectors, parents are determined to seek out quality education.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life

From the enrolment of 31 children in Parramatta in 1821, the sector grew to educate millions of Australians. For about 140 years, it did so without state aid, through the generosity of the faithful and the efforts of priests, brothers and nuns who worked for little more than their keep. The sector now educates one in five Australian students and is heavily involved in preschool and university education. In many places, it led the way in after-school care.
As Rebecca Urban reports, only 63 per cent of students in Catholic schools identify as Catholic. The 37 per cent who do not include other Christians, non-Christians and, increasingly, those with no religious affiliation. In some suburban Catholic schools, non-Catholics outnumber their Catholic schoolmates.
Motivations for parents’ school choices vary. Among other reasons, non-Catholic families select Catholic schools for the chance to access a system in which the best performing secondary schools offer a top-quality education at about half the price of some elite independent schools. Escaping controversial, ideologically driven programs such as Safe Schools in the state sector is another factor. So is the perception of Catholic schools providing better discipline and insisting on better behaviour. Giving children the chance to grow up with a knowledge of Australia’s Christian heritage is also a factor. More broadly, the mobility of families between sectors reflects the dissatisfaction and anxiety of many parents with the nation’s education system overall, despite outstanding school facilities and the investment of billions of taxpayers’ dollars. Parents increasingly are willing to look further afield, pay the price and take a leap of faith to improve their children’s learning.
For most school sectors, there is a flip side to parents shopping around. In 200 Years Young, the pastoral letter released by the Catholic bishops to mark the anniversary, there is a telling paragraph: “In some parts of the country, many better-off Catholic students have been lost to other-than-Catholic independent schools. Government schools and other Christian schools have become rivals for our students in the education ecosystem.” That acknowledges the exodus of some Catholic families from the church’s system, despite its success.
The trend has been evident for decades, including among some dedicated Catholics who reject postmodern religious education and worry about plummeting mass attendances among the young. Pre-COVID, these were 6 per cent officially, but far lower in some areas. Other Catholic parents opt for secular schools because they are indifferent or hostile to the church, or they are more impressed with selective state, independent or other schools. The bishops acknowledge that financial stress has prompted some Catholic families to go, as has disillusionment, they admit, over the child sexual abuse crisis. Meanwhile, as they point out, “many other-than-Catholic families entrust their children to our schools”. They also want to enrol greater numbers of students who are Indigenous, refugees, disabled or disadvantaged. The bishops’ statement hints at some soul searching. Ensuring schools are “truly Catholic in their identity and life” and foster high levels of “religious literacy”, they say, requires that “we retain a ‘critical mass’ of Catholic students and staff”. Religious education must help students “integrate faith, culture and life”. The call for closer ties between parishes and schools, which many will welcome, comes, ironically, just as some dioceses have severed the authority of parish priests over local schools. The analysis by those responsible for 20 per cent of schools highlights the value of choice. Perhaps driven by concerns over standards or the culture wars, parental aspirations to look across the spectrum for good schools has never been stronger.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Hastie speaks from experience	The Australian	Parliament should play a stronger role overseeing the ADF The contribution of former military officer Andrew Hastie on Tuesday made two points clear. First, the army’s loss was parliament’s gain. Second, as a former officer he is willing to share the burden of recrimination that has been heaped exclusively on soldiers of the rank of sergeant and below in the elite Special Air Service Regiment. Mr Hastie served in the SAS for five years, including as a troop commander in the interminable war in Afghanistan. He has represented the West Australian seat of Canning in federal parliament for five years. His article for The Australian, the work of a soldier scholar, drew on theology, philosophy and history.
It made the point that war is innately a brutal enterprise. It is the ultimate audit of a nation and its society, not merely of its armed forces. That is especially true of the optional conflicts in which Australia has engaged since World War II. Not since the darkest days of 1942 has Australia mobilised its entire society, including industry, commerce and civilians, in a war that reached our home soil. In the intervening decades, with the exception of the use of conscripts in Vietnam, our wars have been fought by small, professional, volunteer forces.
Few Australians understand the brutal intensity of the modern battlefield, especially in operations against irregular forces that are indistinguishable from the population our troops are deployed to protect. It is dangerous, thankless work. Across time the political class and most people have lost any real concept of the nature of war, and the unique relationship between the soldier and the liberal democratic state. Florid boilerplate pieties about the Anzac legend ring hollow in the ears of bereaved families and veterans of such optional conflicts. They have seen and done things few Australians comprehend. Many return bearing invisible scars which will never heal. Soldiers endure danger and deprivation. They do so voluntarily, having entered into a contract of unlimited liability with the nation. They are willing to die in pursuit of policy.
It was Prussian general and military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, whom Mr Hastie quoted, who is credited with the insight that war and policy are inextricably linked. While accepting that a minority of his comrades may have behaved appallingly, Mr Hastie has pointed to the abject failure of our political system to devise strategy and provide competent civilian oversight of deployed forces. The alleged crimes of some soldiers did not occur in a moral or political vacuum. The Defence hierarchy demonstrated greater prowess orchestrating rosy media portrayals of our effort in Oruzgan province than in devising war aims. Yet, as David Kilcullen wrote on Saturday, our effort was plagued by a mismatch between the avowed strategy and the force used to implement it. Chief of the Defence Force Angus Campbell says no senior officers provided frank and fearless advice to their political masters about the contradiction between kill and capture missions and nation building. “Mowing the grass” was the epithet many used to describe the relentless killing of Taliban leaders, who were rapidly replaced. As Mr Hastie wrote, parliamentary scrutiny of Defence is broken. He argues for direct oversight of deployed forces in the form of robust examination by a committee of the parliament: “This is an area of urgently needed reform. If we are serious about increased accountability and transparency, then we need proper parliamentary scrutiny of the Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force. Without it, our parliament cannot exercise proper civilian oversight of our military.” We agree. Summary execution of prisoners or innocent civilians is always intolerable. But to place a handful of sergeants and troopers on trial without holding their leaders to account is unacceptable. Fury is mounting among veterans over the selective blame being attributed after what they regard as a deeply flawed strategy in Afghanistan. More should speak up. The Brereton report is a start. But senior military leaders still appear to be more engaged in managing perception than performance.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Cold shower no dampener to state spending on mates	The Australian	Parties should pay for campaign research and polling Back in the Joh Bjelke-Petersen era, when the premier junked daylight saving after some of his followers complained it would fade the curtains and upset the cows, passengers flying into Queensland from the south were occasionally told by pilots to set their watches back a century and one hour. Six weeks from the October 31 election, “The Mates State” is in another time warp. Post Fitzgerald, ICAC and the creation of registers of MPs’ interests and lobbyists, the world has changed. Politicians are expected to be more accountable and transparent in their wheelings and dealings than in years past — in theory at least. Members from all sides have paid a high price for falling down. But Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, whose friendly, homespun style endeared her to many voters initially, seems blithely unaware that she and her government are taking the public for mugs by letting Labor mates and ex-staff on to the government gravy train at taxpayers’ expense.
Ms Palaszczuk and her office have repeatedly insisted she relies solely on advice from Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young in making decisions about COVID-19 restrictions. Last month, Ms Palaszczuk’s spokesman even denied that the government had polled Queenslanders’ views about border closures. But as Michael McKenna and Sarah Elks revealed on Wednesday’s front page, Labor has spent $528,000 of taxpayers’ money on polling voter sentiment about COVID restrictions. And in May the Premier’s office awarded Labor strategist and KPMG partner Mike Kaiser a $275,000 contract to help craft the state’s COVID-19 economic recovery. Mr Kaiser is a former Queensland MP, party official and chief of staff to premiers Anna Bligh in Queensland and Morris Iemma in NSW.
On the other side, as Elks and McKenna report, former federal Nationals MP Larry Anthony and unsuccessful Liberal candidate Malcolm Cole, who own lobbying and communications firms, have secured unbridled access to the conservative side of politics. In the arcane world of Queensland politics, both work for Clive Palmer. Mr Anthony, the federal Nationals president, is on the Liberal National Party state executive. Mr Cole recently quit the state executive after complaints by federal and state MPs over perceived conflicts of interest.
Governments and political parties need professional advice. Ex-MPs, ex-staff and party officials are entitled to earn a living. And in fields such as lobbying and economic consulting, their experience and contacts are often an advantage. The question is who should pay them. In the case of political campaigns, that is political parties. It is reasonable that taxpayers foot the bill for government work — preferably after a competitive tender process, with full disclosure to parliament through annual reports. Transparency is vital in deciding whether such expenditure is in the public interest or about feathering mates’ nests. Last year the Queensland government spent more than $300,000 on external consultants, including Mr Kaiser, Nicole Scurrah — another of Ms Bligh’s chiefs of staff, who works for PwC — and others to help prepare the state budget. As Under Treasurer Frankie Carroll told the state’s budget estimates, using consultants was “normal practice”. What was more problematic was former Queensland treasurer Jackie Trad’s public service razor gang, charged with slashing spending on consultants, hiring Ms Scurrah to advise on how to cut $200m from the bureaucracy in the 2019-20 financial year. Ms Scurrah’s Whistler ski chalet hosted Ms Trad and her family, and fellow cabinet minister Shannon Fentiman and her partner, for a holiday. And former ALP state secretary Evan Moorhead, the Palaszczuk government’s chief of strategy, quit the Premier’s office last year and has since landed 32 clients as a lobbyist to government while also being on a retainer for the ALP.
Given the central role COVID management will play in the campaign, and controversy about the border shutdown, market research on the subject is highly political. The government has refused to say whether polling company Ipsos Public Affairs — paid $528,000 in May and June — asked voters about the border. A spokeswoman admitted the pollster was engaged “to conduct market research and sentiment testing to ensure the government’s COVID-19 public information and behaviour change campaigns were effective, achieved value for money and were evaluated”. Ms Palaszczuk should release the findings. On Wednesday, she told critics to “have a cold shower” because “every other state is asking a whole range of questions about how people are feeling about being in lockdown and coming out of lockdown”. Perhaps. But apart from Western Australia, the nation’s other hub of parochial provincialism, their elections are years away. Ms Palaszczuk claims the research done will not help her electorally. That is a matter of opinion. But she was too cute by half when asked about Mr Kaiser, claiming she “did not know who you’re talking about, sorry” after a reporter slightly mispronounced his name. To jog the Premier’s memory, he was the KPMG partner at a high-level strategy meeting near the Sunshine Coast last year, with Ms Palaszczuk and ministers, to discuss re-election campaigning. As mates go, he is hardly that forgettable.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Balancing the scales of justice	The Australian	Plaintiffs and defendants both deserve procedural fairness
In its final report in December 2017, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse recommended jurors in child abuse trials be permitted to hear “tendency evidence” and “coincidence evidence”. That would include a defendant’s prior offending or acts for which a defendant had been charged but not convicted, other than acts for which they had been acquitted.
On Tuesday, NSW became the first state to introduce legislation for past offending to be put before jurors in child sexual abuse cases. The legislation also will make it easier for multiple victims to give evidence against the same offender in the one trial setting rather than having to do so in separate, siloed proceedings. Comparable bills are expected in other jurisdictions after agreements between attorneys-general.
The reforms — which eventually may have wide repercussions for trials on other criminal matters such as rape and serious assault if victims’ advocates take up the issue — have been introduced for the best of reasons. That is to increase the conviction rate of child sex offenders. In NSW, about 50 per cent of child abuse matters are ­finalised with a conviction, compared with about 90 per cent for most other crimes, as Yoni Bashan reported on Wednesday.
In his second reading speech, NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman said the royal commission considered that “if a complainant accuses a particular person of sexually abusing them as a child, this accusation is more likely to be true if the accused has sexually abused other children”. If a jury hearing child sexual offence proceedings accepted the accused had incurred other convictions or allegations, the jury might be satisfied that they proved the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way; for example, to be sexually attracted to young boys and to act on that attraction. “The jury may then reason that this makes it more likely that the accused acted on this tendency,” Mr Speakman said, quoting the royal commission.
As University of NSW law professor Anne Cossins told The Australian, the changes will help give juries “the bigger picture”. That said, attorneys-general should proceed with caution. The legislation should be implemented with care by trial judges and its effects should be monitored closely in all jurisdictions. It overturns accepted practice, honed through centuries of legal and judicial experience. Traditional legal wisdom held that the danger of tendency and coincidence evidence was its potential to create “unfair prejudice” — swaying juries to think that someone with an established tendency to act in a certain way will yield to that tendency whenever the opportunity arises. In that way, a jury might be diverted from proper consideration of evidence before them and assume the accused’s guilt.
The NSW legislation also raises an issue of balance. The purpose of the change is to shift the balance in criminal proceedings in favour of complainants. If this is justifiable on the grounds of transparency, it opens the door to those who believe juries should also have the benefit of an equivalent level of transparency about complainants. Tendency evidence, Mr Speakman said, was about “the character, reputation or conduct of a person … to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind”. Defence barristers, conscious of their clients’ presumptions of innocence, might argue transparency should be even-handed. The criminal record of complainants or, even more so, any track record of lodging vexatious complaints also reflects on their characters and might well warrant consideration by juries.The five-year royal commission revealed the vast scale of horrific abuse that affected so many children for decades. The commission fielded more than 42,000 calls and 25,000 letters, held more than 8000 private sessions and 57 formal public hearings, and heard from more than 1200 witnesses. Its findings reflected a shameful failing of our society. Legal reform is a must and this bill arises from one recommendation with wide implications. Governments must ensure the scales of justice are balanced between plaintiffs and defendants.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Spinning Gladys in Wonderland	The Australian	Playing political parlour games over Ruby Princess debacle
As we confront the escalating medical, economic and social challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, Australians are recalibrating judgments on leaders. According to Newspoll, voters have marked up Scott Morrison’s leadership. Two months ago the Prime Minister’s standing seemed irreparably damaged by stumbles during Black Summer’s bushfires. Now, Mr Morrison has built a consensus on COVID-19 responses via a nine-member national cabinet and restored confidence in his abilities. Decisive and straight-talking Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews also has enhanced his authority. The most dramatic reputational turnaround, however, has befallen NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, who a year ago seemed so calm, sincere and competent when she led her team to a third term.
As Simon Benson noted on ABC’s Insiders on Sunday, Ms Berejiklian “is the first casualty of this crisis”. Two words pervade her leadership: Ruby Princess. On March 19, almost 2700 travellers from the cruise ship were unleashed without health checks on the community. The vessel is the largest single source of COVID-19, with more than 620 cases; there have been 12 associated deaths. After blaming the Australian Border Force for the bungle, the NSW Premier apologised last week. Well, kind of. “I appreciate how upset everybody is,” she said. “There were several authorities involved and I’ll be the first one to look someone in the eye if they’ve done the wrong thing and make them accountable.” She won’t have to look far from home.
As we reported on Saturday, NSW Health officials did not board the Ruby Princess to test passengers for the virus even though the liner’s on-board doctor told them explicitly there were sick travellers on the ship. Emails obtained by Yoni Bashan show NSW officials dismissed any concern about the health of passengers and told the ship it was “free to disembark” without further tests. The revelations raise serious questions about the NSW Premier’s handling of the fiasco. The emails confirm ABF commissioner Michael Outram’s statement that NSW Health officials declined to board the ship and gave it the all-clear despite being told about passengers with flu symptoms.
Last week Ms Berejiklian ordered NSW Police Commissioner Michael Fuller to investigate but implied the ship misled health officials about the condition of passengers. Homicide detectives will conduct a formal inquiry to determine if operator Carnival Australia withheld crucial information. For a time, this move will insulate the Berejiklian government from political heat and media scrutiny. Sorry, folks, this is a criminal investigation. No pun intended, it’s a cop-out. The probe is likely to be a protracted one: nearly 4000 passengers and crew were on board at the time of the ship’s arrival.
Yet who in their right mind would think it OK to disperse so many people into the community a week after a pandemic had been declared; when more than 200,000 people had already been infected and 8800 had died; and while cruise ships were in the frame as super spreaders. Good to go, people. As NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard told Sky News on Sunday, “The community should be satisfied that we had the best of the best making the decision.” Mr Hazzard said he “would have preferred” the bungle had not happened. Ditto, times a thousand. Asked if he now conceded letting thousands of untested passengers into Sydney was wrong, he said no.Yet two weeks ago, when he bumbled along like a riddle-me-this character in a Gladys in Wonderland spoof, Mr Hazzard told reporters: “If I had my opportunity to have my two bob’s worth, with the benefit of what we now know about those … people, I’d have said yeah, maybe we should hold them on the ship.” This is what passes for ministerial accountability in NSW. The government is spinning like crazy, playing parlour games. Look over there! On Monday Ms Berejiklian announced NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons would head a new agency, Resilience NSW. Exquisite. Resilient NSW citizens are bearing unprecedented restrictions. This new normal, however, demands authorities be open and straight: taking responsibility for decisions good and bad. Ruby Princess has broken public trust. How can we be confident it won’t happen again if critical answers are not forthcoming until long after the crisis?	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Abuse in WA must be stopped	The Australian	Police are in a strong position to judge the best options
While national attention focuses on the fire emergency, especially in the southeast, an ongoing tragedy at the opposite end of the continent is too serious to overlook. Children’s lives and safety are at stake from chronic abuse in their own homes. For several days, indigenous affairs editor Paige Taylor has reported on a proposal by Western Australia Police Commissioner Chris Dawson for blanket restrictions on alcohol sales across the Kimberley, including the tourist hubs of Broome and Kununurra, for the sake of health, welfare and law and order. Under the proposal, bottle shops would be banned from selling anything but light beer. Full- and mid-strength beer, wine and spirits would be limited to restaurants, pubs and other ­licensed premises.
Family assaults in the northwest more than doubled in the six years between 2012 and 2018 — from 83 a month, or a total of 996 in 2012 to 228 a month or a total of 2740 for 2018. This is despite the fact that fewer than 35,000 people live in the remote towns and communities of the Kimberley. Mr Dawson’s officers consulted indigenous leaders and frontline workers before he asked the state director of liquor licensing for the blanket ban. Half the Kimberley’s residents are indigenous. As senior Jaru woman Doreen Green, who successfully campaigned for a ban on full- and mid-strength takeaway in her home town of Halls Creek 10 years ago, said, it was wrong to describe the proposed alcohol restrictions as racist. It was a human rights issue, she said. Ms Green saw the effects of alcohol abuse on children when she taught in Halls Creek in 2002. She acted then because her students, aged seven and eight, were exposed to family violence and sleep-deprived.
Experience shows such restrictions are effective. Similar action in other parts of the region, such as the small inland Kimberley town of Fitzroy Crossing 12 years ago, resulted in emergency hospital presentations falling 36 per cent in the first year. A subsequent study found the world’s highest rate of foetal ­alcohol spectrum disorder among children born in and around the area before the restrictions WA Police was prompted to investigate the extent of alcohol-related crime and harm in the Kimberley after State Coroner Ros Fogliani’s report in February 2019 into the suicides of 13 indigenous children and young people in the region between 2012 and 2016. Almost all the children and young persons who had taken their own lives had grown up in homes marred by high levels of alcohol abuse. In Kununurra, about 70 local children are periodically in trouble with police for crimes they commit in small groups while roaming at night. At least one child has said he preferred a jail cell to going home.Mr Dawson’s proposal is at odds with the McGowan Labor government and the Australian Hotels Association, which favour the establishment of a banned-drinkers register instead. A register has been in place in the Northern Territory since 2017 and is designed to block known problem drinkers at the point of sale. Experience with the BDR has been mixed. The system can be beaten, with friends buying alcohol for those who have been struck off. Police in the Kimberley favour region-wide ­restrictions to thwart sly-groggers transporting alcohol hundreds of kilometres and selling it at inflated prices. They are best placed to judge the most effective strategies.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Wake up, Australia, there will be no easy snapback	The Australian	Political leaders must abandon lazy ways on the economy Every ray of sunshine is welcome in the bleak midwinter of the coronavirus recession. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting Australia, alone among rich nations, will suffer a milder-than-anticipated drop in gross domestic product of 4.5 per cent this year, down from an April prediction of a 6.7 per cent contraction. That’s in line with the view of our top advisers. Treasury had initially expected a 20 per cent slump in GDP this quarter, and a similar fall in the number of hours worked. As well, Moody’s reconfirmed Australia’s AAA sovereign credit rating, putting us in an elite club of 10 countries rated AAA by all three global ratings agencies.
But cold reality bites back. In its latest world outlook, the IMF revealed the pandemic will lead to a 4.9 per cent plunge in global economic activity this year, compared with a 3 per cent fall it had forecast in April. We are an open, trading economy, so that will keep a lid on recovery and getting people back to work. COVID-19 is unleashing cyclical and structural change across industries and in the labour market. On Thursday, Qantas said it was sacking 6000 people. “These are hard days, Australia,” Scott Morrison said, presaging more difficult moments ahead. Commonwealth Bank economists predict the number of unemployed will surge past one million in September, ahead of the withdrawal of emergency fiscal support at the end of that month. No one in government is now talking about “snapback”, a term deployed three months ago to signal a return to normal settings in welfare and a halt to Keynesian “whatever it takes”.
Certainly there is intense lobbying from business and community groups to avoid a “fiscal cliff” when JobKeeper ends and the dole returns to normal. As well, there will be pressure on state and territory leaders to reopen borders and ease restrictions. The Prime Minister again stated medical advice has never been to close borders. Outbreaks will occur, but we have tools and processes to deal with them as long as we operate in a COVID-safe way, in business and in social life. The last thing we want is a “go, stop, go, stop” rhythm. But even assuming a smooth transition out of shutdown, and success in fighting the virus, post-pandemic Australia will be a jobless devastation zone. This will likely be the worst economic calamity in 90 years, nothing like the drop in GDP in the early 1980s or the “recession we had to have” at the start of the 90s.
All organisations are adjusting how they work, searching for cost savings as operating budgets are slashed for the coming financial year. It should put into perspective the shameful carry-on of NSW public servants over a wage freeze and other proposed mild administrative reforms in other sectors. The slack in the labour market, with a record under-utilisation rate of more than 20 per cent and hundreds of thousands exiting the job search, is here to stay. As Mark Wooden noted in his dissenting view in the annual wage review by the Fair Work Commission, a return to pre-recession employment levels can take a long time: in the 80s it took six years for the unemployment rate to recover and more than 10 years in the 90s. Professor Wooden said there was a distinct possibility that many who lose their job or are entering the workforce this year “will be consigned to a future of long-term unemployment and/or permanently reduced career earnings”.
This should be a wake-up call for the political class in Canberra and beyond to focus on the main game of growth, jobs, productivity and living standards. A month ago, Mr Morrison declared we had to reset and go for growth of 3.5 per cent each year — one percentage point above our long-run average — for five years to claw back the lost ground from this disaster. He got a tick for ambition but economists were sceptical about the chances of meeting that target. Why? Because of two decades of complacency on supply-side reform. Those lost years were hurting us pre-crisis — anaemic growth in GDP and incomes, falling productivity and new start-ups, and capital shallowing — and they’ll hold us back in recovery. We need reforms for a more dynamic economy otherwise, as serial optimist Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe warned, Australia “will meander along with mediocre growth”. Meandering along is not an option for us. Comfortable and relaxed is history. Right now, approvals processes kill projects. Our industrial system delivers the world’s highest minimum wage but not the flexibility or simplicity for job creation in new areas. The tax system should try to promote expansion and innovation. State taxes hold back the movement of capital and labour. Yet, apart from the notable exception of NSW leaders, like Narcissus premiers are falling in love with their reflections rather than getting busy on retooling their states. The Morrison government is doing running repairs on workplace laws, skills and red tape, while building a debt mountain. Josh Frydenberg’s economic statement next month and October budget will reveal how much political will, energy and imagination the government has for reform or if policy incrementalism is its comfort zone. But the Coalition is unlikely to get any help for business-friendly policies from Anthony Albanese, despite an apparent Road to Eden-Monaro conversion on climate and energy policy. Labor is simply striking a pose.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
EDITORIAL Spread of virus puts emphasis on wise response	The Northern Advocate	Politicians, experts and officials walk a fine line with public health emergencies. They want the public to take it seriously and take precautions, but not panic.
They want to show plans and measures are in place to slow and contain the threat, but also don’t want to provoke an over-reaction.
With Covid-19 at large in the world, people look to the authorities for protection, expertise and competence.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s approach to news of New Zealand’s first confirmed case, a person returning from Iran, was to urge calm.
People were told not to toss routine aside and to go “about their daily lives”. It’s the same language used to dampen fears after urban terror attacks.
If careful planning, an ability to adapt and good information channels keep the outbreak to a few isolated cases, people will have confidence that authorities know what they’re doing.
We could be in worse hands. In the United States, President Donald Trump on Saturday used the word “hoax” when talking about the coronavirus. Hoax is a dangerous word to bandy about when people need to come forward to seek help.
Trump was likely spooked by a market downturn, which placed a question mark over his argument for re-election — a well-performing economy. Yesterday he announced the first death in the US from Covid-19 and more travel restrictions. He also denied trying to minimise the virus.
A combination of a careful official response — checks, quarantines, tracing source infection — and public awareness seems the best path.
Cases of Covid-19, which is spread by droplets, are appearing in dozens of countries. World Health Organisation data shows that most new cases outside China were sourced locally or traced to a non-China country. People are now getting it without overseas travel or a link to a previous case.
The lack of a vaccine, the economic toll around the world and travel restrictions are major concerns.
Experts say to regularly wash hands with soap for 20 seconds, to avoid touching your face and to keep a safe distance from people coughing and sneezing.
The people most at risk are, unfortunately, those on the front line in any deadly flu season — people in hospitals, the elderly and frail in rest homes, and healthcare workers.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Morrison ends a difficult year in the ascendancy	The Australian	Politics is fickle but our institutions have served us well in pandemic
As parliament rises for the year it has been difficult for many writers to reflect on events without falling into cliches. From constant invocations of “unprecedented” and “new normal” to “this year like no other”, many have been bewildered by the era through which we are passing and unable to interpret events with clarity. For clear analysis, Paul Kelly wrote on Wednesday: “There have been multiple traumas — unjustified border closures, hotel quarantine blunders, Victoria’s denial of political accountability, self-serving premiers exploiting pandemic protectionism — yet Australia’s record against COVID-19 is a remarkable achievement in global terms.” That is a first draft that is likely to stand the test of time.
Our island geography, strong social safety net and excellent health system have served us well. Pragmatism has eclipsed ideology. Incumbency has been immune to cheap politics. Accordingly, there should be little surprise that Scott Morrison ends the year in the political ascendancy. Yet no one knows better than he how ephemeral such apparent invincibility can be. The lesson of history is that at times of strength, leaders must use their political capital to push the difficult business of reform.
The Prime Minister had a brush with political mortality in May last year, winning an election that most commentators had awarded to the ALP months before. Having been humiliated by Mr Morrison in May, those same experts pronounced his political death after his ill-advised jaunt overseas on holiday at the height of a disastrous bushfire crisis last December. In normal circumstances that miscalculation could have damaged his standing irreparably. However, if Mr Morrison has demonstrated one political attribute, it is that he does not make the same mistake twice. No sooner had the bushfire smoke cleared than the nation found itself facing a pandemic that posed an immediate health risk. Suppression of the pandemic could be achieved only by placing the economy into an induced coma. No ideological fetishes curtailed Mr Morrison’s government in dealing with these twin crises. Having skewered Labor over deficits during the election campaign last year, Mr Morrison and his Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, showed no compunction in authorising enormous increases in commonwealth expenditure to sustain the livelihoods of millions of Australians and the businesses that employed them. Some fiscal conservatives berated them for this. But history is likely to vindicate the Morrison government. Australians tend to be a pragmatic people. And this Prime Minister sits comfortably in the mainstream centre-right tradition. Polls consistently demonstrated that the voters did not accept the arguments of ideological fringe-dwellers that the virus was confected or essentially harmless. They saw the ghastly images of improvised morgues and overcrowded hospitals in the US and Britain, and rewarded incumbents in Australia who placed public safety above economic indicators. As the parliament rose yesterday, fewer than 1000 Australians had died from this virus and there were fewer than 50 active cases in this nation. Regardless of one’s ideological proclivities, those are numbers to be celebrated. On occasion we have been critical of federal and state governments, especially where they have clumsily infringed civil liberties or undermined the federal compact through hard border closures that seemed more calculated to inflate poll numbers than to suppress infection numbers. But, on balance, our institutions have served us well. Our Constitution has served us well and too often it has been honoured in the breach this year. Again, that has incensed legal purists but not aroused the ire of most Australians. Hence, it is likely that West Australian Premier Mark McGowan will be resoundingly re-elected next March, as was his Queensland counterpart Annastacia Palaszczuk in October, and the Labor-Green government in the ACT. Oppositions have struggled for relevance in this climate of uncertainty. In Queensland, Victoria and WA, the Coalition parties have been poorly served by weak leaders and unimpressive candidates. This is a crisis that has the capacity to undermine our parliamentary institutions if not dealt with over time. At the federal level, Anthony Albanese also has struggled to achieve traction. His problem is compounded by a lingering identity crisis not of his making. The resignation of Joel Fitzgibbon from his shadow cabinet has provided a focal point for destabilisation of Mr Albanese. Labor is struggling to straddle the divide between its blue-collar and middle-class constituencies, especially coalminers and the urban professional classes. Yet speculation that Mr Albanese will be removed is premature. Likewise, as Mr Morrison will readily aver, the next election remains an open contest. The Morrison government holds a mere one seat majority, and this extraordinary year has revealed bold predictions are fraught with risk. At times this year, politics have been acrimonious and polarising. The centre has held. But, as our leader sheath their swords for the Christmas recess, they and their fellow citizens can draw some comfort that they do indeed inhabit a Lucky Country, whose public institutions have served them well in a dangerous time.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
McKenzie quits, falling down on accountability	The Australian	Pork-barrelling denies some communities a sporting chance
Nationals deputy leader Bridget McKenzie had no alternative but to resign from cabinet as Agriculture Minister after Scott Morrison briefed her on the report into her conduct by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Secretary Phil Gaetjens. The report found Senator McKenzie breached ministerial standards by failing to disclose her membership of the Wangaratta Clay Target Club that was given $36,000 in the Community Sports Infrastructure Grants saga, when she was sports minister. The Prime Minister said the report found there were “also a number of other matters relating to another organisation’’. Senator McKenzie’s position had been under a cloud since the scandal broke, but Mr Morrison followed procedure by awaiting Mr Gaetjens’s report.
Mr Gaetjens found no fault with the way the grants were administered, although Mr Morrison conceded “there may be differing views about the fairness of the process’’. The minister, he said, used the discretion she was afforded. In mid-January, a damning report by the Australian National Audit Office found Senator McKenzie often ignored merit and favoured marginal Coalition seats and those targeted by the government before last year’s election. As a result, there was “distribution bias” in the awarding of 684 grants that was “not consistent with the ­assessed merit of applications”, the audit found. Such pork-barrelling of public money for political gain is unacceptable, as it was 26 years ago when former Labor minister Ros Kelly resigned when she was unable to explain the distribution of $30m of sports grants to marginal electorates. In that fiasco, the process was conducted on a whiteboard in the minister’s office and wiped off.
In accepting Senator McKenzie’s resignation, Mr Morrison has set the bar for his other ministers, demanding accountability and transparency in the handling of public money. John Howard lost six ministers in his first term, who fell short of his ministerial code of conduct — a turnover that ultimately strengthened his leadership. While the loss of his first minister is a setback for Mr Morrison, the government hopes Senator McKenzie’s departure will take some heat out of the issue by the time parliament resumes on Tuesday. While embarrassing for the government, the saga should not distract from more important issues of managing the economic fallout of the coronavirus, the fire recovery process and budget preparation. But it comes at a difficult time, when the ratings of the government and Mr Morrison have fallen in the polls, mainly over the handling of the bushfire emergency.
Senator McKenzie’s resignation as deputy Nationals leader has exacerbated the junior Coalition party’s political problems. The leadership is a matter for the parliamentary team. But with Mike McCormack proving a reticent leader, including in this controversy, the party needs a credible performer as deputy, especially in the bush. Resources and Northern Australia Minister Matt Canavan should be a strong contender for the party’s Senate leadership.By way of reform, the only upside from the scandal is the acceptance, as Josh Frydenberg said on ABC television on Sunday, of the Auditor-General’s advice that “things need to change’’. They do. In future, ministers administering such programs will be required to provide written explanations for their decisions, the Treasurer said, including any reasons they differed from the recommendations of bodies such as Sport Australia.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Pricing workers out of jobs would hold back recovery	The Australian	Post-COVID, it makes sense to delay wage hikes in some sectors Fair Work Commission president Iain Ross has put an interesting question to the Morrison government, trade unions and employers. Justice Ross has asked whether low-paid workers in industries struggling in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic should face a second successive year of delayed increases in the minimum wage. Sharp battlelines are being drawn. The ACTU is pitching for a 3.5 per cent or $26.38-a-week increase from July, to be paid to 2.2 million workers, arguing that a failure to boost workers’ pay packets “threatens the entire recovery”, Ewin Hannan reports. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the National Farmers Federation and Business NSW, the peak employer organisation of our largest state, want the Fair Work Commission to award a zero increase, citing weakness in the economy and vulnerability of businesses.
That is part of the picture — in some sectors. The latest Deloitte Access Economics quarterly forecast shows the economy growing by a healthy 4.9 per cent in 2021 after contracting by more than 1 per cent in 2020. But after a remarkable job recovery, the forecast says, “things will be cloudy, with many stories of individual business closures and job losses amid the end to JobKeeper’’. The report predicts unemployment of 5.6 per cent by late this year. The big bump in economic growth from the recovery will gradually fall away as government assistance eases and future growth becomes “more of a grind’’.
In July last year, the Fair Work Commission granted a 1.75 per cent increase, or $13-a-week minimum wage increase — a worthwhile boost. In view of the impact of COVID-19, its timing was staggered across different sectors. Frontline health, aged-care, childcare and other essential services workers received the rise from July 1. Construction and manufacturing workers benefited from November 1. And staff in tourism, hospitality, airlines, restaurants, retail and the arts — the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic — received it on February 1 this year. Given the severe threat to jobs and profits posed by COVID, especially in the tourism and hospitality sectors, the staggered approach made sense. And, after paying an increase in February this year, it is reasonable, as Restaurant and Catering chief executive Wes Lambert says, that COVID-impacted employers should not be forced to fund two pay rises in five months. Any new increase, as Mr Lambert says, should not be applied to the sector until February next year. That delay could save jobs and keep businesses going until more of the economy opens up and stays open, activity picks up in central business districts and international visitors return. For good reason, the government is urging caution, telling the Fair Work Commission that increasing the minimum wage this year could be a “major constraint to small business recovery” and cost jobs. The risk of domestic COVID outbreaks and disruptions to other major economies are such that the economic climate remains uncertain.
Much will depend on how soon and how effectively vaccination programs eliminate the risk of major COVID outbreaks here and overseas. Delays to Australia’s vaccine rollout will not help, with businesses reliant on the reopening of international borders facing an uncertain year. Economists are confident the latest news around the AstraZeneca jab will not be enough to meaningfully “shift the dial” on the pace of the recovery. But they also predict most Australians will not enjoy a return to pre-COVID normality until early next year. Snap lockdowns and domestic border closures will remain a feature of day-to-day lives, Ernst & Young chief economist Jo Masters says on Monday. International borders being closed for longer would have knock-on effects for tourists, international students and migration — “all important drivers of economic activity”.
The principle that all employees are entitled to at least a minimum wage — the lowest amount they can be paid for their work — is an accepted part of workplace relations in Australia. Those workers, traditionally, all receive a pay rise at the same time. A second year of delaying pay rises for workers in sectors experiencing economic hardship could set a precedent, one that unions would oppose vehemently. But it would bring some flexibility to workplace relations and link wage rises to employers’ ability to pay, which would help struggling small businesses. ACTU assistant secretary Scott Connolly told The Australian recently that “profits are soaring over 8 per cent and the Reserve Bank is calling for wage growth above 3 per cent, but the federal government still wants the minimum wage to go backwards in real terms’’. In its March board meeting, the RBA said it would “not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range. For this to occur, wages growth would need to be materially higher than it is currently’’. But this would require significant gains in employment, the RBA said, and a return to a tight labour market. That will come about, however, when economic activity, demand and profits lift. Forcing industries adversely affected by COVID to pay 3.5 per cent wage rises from July 1, as the ACTU demands, would harm the jobs market, many workers and the wider economy.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Submarines show national security comes at high cost	The Australian	Post-pandemic, peak-value defence spending will be key
On Saturday in The Weekend Australian, Australian Strategic Policy Institute CEO Peter Jennings called for a new Defence white paper to rethink the strategic changes accelerated by COVID-19. The 2016 Defence white paper concentrated on long-term investment proposals for the ADF. But the government now needed to focus on the capability of the defence force and what could be done quickly to increase deterrent capacity and strike power, Mr Jennings, a former deputy secretary for strategy in the Defence Department, argued. One area that needed attention, he said, was the capacity of the industrial base to rapidly produce critical inputs for war despite interruptions to global supply chains.
The estimated cost of building the 12 Attack-class submarines, the nation’s largest-ever defence investment, has soared to $90bn, up by almost $10bn in five months, mainly due to currency fluctuations and inflation calculations. The projection does not include the $145bn cost of maintaining the boats over their 50-year lifespan. As Ben Packham writes on Monday, the spike has prompted calls for a rethink of the ADF’s wider procurement plans.
The submarines are vital to national security. As the 2016 Defence white paper noted, by 2035 about half of the world’s submarines will be operating in the Indo-Pacific region where Australia’s interests are most engaged. They will not strengthen the nation’s deterrent capacity and strike power in the next decade, however. Construction of the first of the Shortfin Barracudas, to be built in Adelaide, to French company Naval Group’s specifications, is not scheduled to start until 2024, for completion in the early 2030s. The final boat is due for completion in the mid-2050s. Buying a ready-made product, the option favoured by Tony Abbott as prime minister, would have strengthened defence preparedness much earlier. On the positive side, building the submarines should boost Australia’s capacity to produce defence equipment independently. Quality control and cost containment will make or break the project, the outcome of which will be vital for national security and have a significant impact on the budget bottom line in the years of recovery from COVID-19.
From the outset, The Australian was wary of the “populist protectionism” behind the decision to build the vessels in Adelaide. It appeared to be more about shoring up jobs, local industry and votes in South Australia ahead of the 2016 federal election than securing the best boats at lowest cost in the shortest time to cover looming gaps in defence capability. In January, a report by the Australian Nationa­l Audit Office revealed the submarines’ design phase was running nine months late. It also revealed Defence­ had approved the fabric­ation of complex hull parts for the first future submarine to be undertaken in France, rather than ­Australia, to guard against further delays.Amid deteriorating strategic circumstances, the COVID-19 crisis has presented an opportunity, either through a fresh white paper or another process, for the ADF and government to review other major hardware procurements. New anti-ship missiles and better cyber and satellite capabilities were urgent priorities, ASPI senior analyst Marcus Hellyer told Packham. In the context of China’s increasing militarisation across the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, maximising the effectiveness of defence spending needs to be a central priority of the Morrison government as it focuses on economic recovery post-pandemic.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Indigenous ready to take initiatives to close the gap	The Australian	Poverty and economic disengagement are bars to progress
Warren Mundine is correct when he argues that economic fundamentals — jobs, creating the right environment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander entrepreneurship, education and training — need to be the backbone of indigenous policy. In an essay published by the Centre for Independent Studies­ on Wednesday, Mr Mundine, the former head of the Abbott government’s indigenous advisory council and a former Labor Party president, points out that poverty is “the reason for the gap in so many areas of health and life expectancy”. Regional economic ­development, welfare reform, targeted action to move people from welfare to economic participation and the use of local workforces for local jobs should be part of closing the gap.
Indigenous enterprise, as Mr Mundine says, must be encouraged. And current circumstances present several opportunities. In far north Queensland, jobs for fruit pickers are going begging on the Atherton Tablelands and around Innisfail in the absence of overseas workers due to the COVID-19 crisis. The jobs are not being filled by workers from indigenous communities for want of a bus to transport them. And while it would be more complicated, the scandalous prices being charged for groceries in the Torres Strait Islands, up to five times as much as supermarket prices, should open the way for fresh competitors.
Mr Mundine’s priorities broadly accord with the goals of Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt’s rewrite of Closing the Gap targets. That vital process, central to practical reconciliation, was introduced by the Rudd government in 2008 to reduce disadvantage among indigenous people and measure the improvement. After 12 annual reports, just two of the seven Closing the Gap targets have been achieved — early childhood education and Year 12 attainment. The process is ripe for an overhaul. But those achievements are a base for two of the new Closing the Gap goals. These are: increasing the proportion of Aborigines aged 25 to 34 who have completed a tertiary qualification (Certificate III or above); and increasing the proportion of young Aborigines (aged 15 to 24) who are in jobs, education or training. For some communities, these are highly ambitious goals. But as Mr Mundine bluntly warned: “If indigenous children don’t go to school, then into the workforce, they’re much more likely to end up in jail.” A child does not receive an effective education, as he said, if their school attendance falls below 90 per cent. In 2015 only 49 per cent of indigenous students met the critical 90 per cent attendance threshold. And in very remote areas, the figure was 21.9 per cent. Without major change, which must be motivated by families and communities, outcomes will not improve, regardless of resourcing. Detailed data and accountability will be essential to monitor progress.
The major change in the Closing the Gap process envisaged by Mr Wyatt is the plan to hand indigenous bodies unprecedented responsibility, power and funding to improve health and education outcomes. The failures and limitations of earlier top-down approaches and encouraging developments on the ground suggest this is the way forward. Indigenous leader Pat Turner, who has worked with Mr Wyatt to overhaul the Closing the Gap process, represents 143 community-controlled indigenous health groups as chief executive of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation. The sector, she says, is in touch with grassroots people all over the country. Equal decision-making between governments and Aboriginal people at local, regional, state and national level, Ms Turner said, would achieve more than programs provided by “those sitting in ivory towers”. West Australian epidemiologist Fiona Stanley agrees. She points to the success of indigenous communities in limiting the COVID-19 outbreak as an example of what local groups can achieve: “If you give Aboriginal people control and support them” in true partnerships where they lead, “you get effective outcomes”. Ear, nose and throat surgeons working with speech pathologists, teachers and others to improve the health of indigenous children through the Deadly Ears project have found the same. Following the advice of community elders has resulted in the program being taken seriously, to the benefit of children’s ability to hear their teachers at school. Concurrent with the reforms to Closing the Gap, campaigners for a constitutionally enshrined indigenous voice to government also are stepping up their efforts. While also vitally important, that is a separate debate. But the overall picture shows indigenous people increasingly are ready, willing and able to take responsibility for their own lives. Doing so, Mr Mundine says, must include economic engagement, because he is unaware of “any race, community or group of people who have pulled themselves out of poverty without an economy”.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Technology-first approach best to cut carbon dioxide	The Australian	Pragmatism is needed in managing the politics of climate change Scott Morrison was putting on a brave face when he declared the climate wars were over as regards a carbon-neutral future. On cue, the Australian Energy Market Operator said it was on alert for power shortages because of an overstretched electricity system, and the Nationals doubled down on plans for a new coal-fired power station in the NSW Hunter Valley. The Nationals want to kickstart manufacturing by sticking with fossil fuels for power, and funding development of new oil reserves to replace diminishing supplies from Bass Strait. Meanwhile, Australia’s agreement to join the international Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment, signed by Environment Minister Sussan Ley, was rejected as gross hypocrisy by green groups that want nothing short of net-zero emissions by 2040 and the phasing out of mining and burning coal and gas.
The Prime Minister and Energy Minister Angus Taylor have the job of remaining focused while being pulled in different directions by domestic and international forces. Their guiding light should be a recognition that Australian voters are pragmatic. The government owes much of its remarkable electoral victory in 2019 to the fact it got the politics on climate right. While the ALP was unable to explain properly how its policies for greater emissions cuts by 2030 would work and, more important, how much they would cost, the Coalition stuck with its track record. Since then the government has worked hard to break the perception that Australia is not doing enough. In fact, Australia has deployed renewables 25 per cent faster than Europe’s four largest economies combined and 10 times faster than the global average. On a per capita basis, between 2005 and 2018 Australia cut emissions by 29 per cent compared with 16 per cent in Germany, 7 per cent in Japan, 16 per cent in New Zealand, 19 per cent in the US and 13 per cent in Canada. The government is sticking with its existing Paris Agreement pledge to cut emissions by 26 to 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese is under pressure in his own party because he has been unable to address the conflicting demands of inner-city electorates that want tough action on climate, and regional voters who depend on coal and manufacturing jobs to make a living. The ALP now has a long-term goal to be climate neutral by 2050 but no short-term goal because that would demand details on how it would be achieved and what it would cost. Mr Morrison says his government will not increase its targets for 2030 and beyond until 2025, when it is required to do so under the terms of the Paris Agreement that has been signed. Within that agreement, Australia has accepted a global target of becoming carbon neutral sometime in the second half of the century.
The election of US President Joe Biden and his appointment of former secretary of state John Kerry to negotiate climate issues will change global politics on the subject. Much of it will be shaped by what happens with the broader US relationship with China and how Europe progresses with plans for a carbon border adjustment mechanism, to be tabled in the European parliament in June as part of a package of laws aimed at cutting the EU’s emissions by 55 per cent below 1990 levels by the end of the decade. The US has pledged to cut emissions by the same amount as Australia, but by 2025 rather than 2030, and it has been performing well as coal-fired generation is closed in favour of cheap fracked gas. China has won applause for saying it will become carbon neutral by 2060 but it is allowed to increase emissions through to 2030. For credibility, Mr Biden will be forced to increase the US’s ambition but he has said he will demand more from China, the world’s biggest emitter. Australia will be best served playing to its strengths. Mr Taylor spoke with Mr Kerry this week. They “noted the role that breakthroughs in technology will play in reducing global emissions and making net zero achievable”. The Biden administration is likely to focus on reducing the cost of grid-scale storage, developing carbon capture and working to get affordable small modular nuclear reactors to market. Australia is investing in reducing the cost of energy storage, producing hydrogen to replace natural gas and developing carbon capture as well as land-based solutions such as soil carbon and regenerative farming. Co-operation with the US on technology was at the centre of the climate change response agreed by John Howard and George W. Bush. As Bjorn Lomborg wrote on Saturday, it was a key part of the Paris Agreement discussions. Helping develop technologies that can be deployed at scale remains the greatest contribution Australia, as a small country responsible for a tiny fraction of global carbon dioxide emissions, can make.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Leadership solidarity vital in coronavirus challenge	The Australian	Premiers have been exposed as unreliable and reckless
At a historic, sombre and downsized sitting of parliament on Monday, Scott Morrison surveyed a crisis-swept land and looked to fortify a people in transition. “For many, young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives,” he warned, citing world wars and economic depression as progenitors. A century ago, our fledgling federation was confronted by the Spanish flu pandemic. Around 15,000 Australians died. Most of the victims were aged 25 to 40. Writing in Inquirer on Saturday, the day tens of thousands of people hit the sand and surf at Bondi Beach, Geoffrey Blainey lamented how the influenza disaster had been forgotten, even by historians like him. If the same proportion of the Australian population were to die from the coronavirus as from the Spanish flu, it would mean 70,000 deaths. “It is a sobering thought,” Professor Blainey wrote. “It was vital that the tragedies of 1919 should be inside our national memory. They convey the message: Be prepared. But this year we were not prepared, mentally, for a new pandemic.” One of the lessons from that time was state governments, much more powerful then, had far too many disputes with Canberra over how to deal with the influenza calamity. The bickering put immense strain on the federation and likely led to more deaths than otherwise would have occurred. A hundred years on, the states tend to follow the commonwealth’s lead, given the taxing power of its purse. But when they come together as a governing collective, Canberra and the states can get things done, especially in a crisis or to tackle the intractable. To contain the spread of COVID-19, the Prime Minister assembled a nine-member national cabinet; it includes him, six premiers and two chief ministers. It has been a good platform for quick action, policy co-ordination and consistent messaging, especially on medical issues and social distancing measures.
Group solidarity was fractured on Sunday, however, when NSW and Victoria opted to go on dangerous frolics of their own. It’s true our two largest states, their capitals global cities, have the most COVID-19 infections; the next containment phase, as Mr Morrison foreshadowed, will be localised measures for contagion hot spots. In response to state requests, Canberra brought forward a meeting of the national cabinet to Sunday evening; a regular session had been scheduled for Tuesday night. It appears the states felt Canberra was moving too slowly to enforce tougher restrictions on public gatherings, schools and businesses.
Yet some of that anxiety, as well as mass confusion, is due to state debacles. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was too slow in dealing with the bedlam at Bondi Beach and elsewhere in her state. Inexplicably, NSW officials failed to properly process 2700 disembarking cruise passengers, now dispersed in communities around the country, from the Ruby Princess last Thursday; 50 passengers have tested positive to COVID-19, with numbers expected to climb. In the hours before Sunday’s national cabinet session, state and territory leaders panicked by effectively announcing they were shuttering their economies. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced schools in his state would close on Tuesday; NSW and the ACT indicated they would do the same. So-called “non-essential” workplaces would be shut down in NSW and Victoria.
At best, this was a boneheaded power play, trying to force Canberra’s hand. In reality, the breaking of ranks was reckless behaviour, plunging a skittish community into further panic and disarray. Ms Berejiklian made matters worse on Monday when she declared schools would stay open in NSW but advised parents to keep children at home. What’s going on? What are parents to do? This impulsive implosion of national cabinet discipline undermined Mr Morrison’s authority, to a degree, and the decisions and advice of the medical guiding hand in emergencies, which is the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. In truth, state leaders exposed themselves as unreliable, fickle and rash. Mr Morrison mopped up the mess on Sunday evening after the meeting, outlining new restrictions on pubs, clubs, cafes, restaurants, gyms, indoor arenas, cinemas and religious services that would come into effect on Monday. He was adamant the AHPPC advice on schools had not changed. The Prime Minister also was obliged to assure Australians the national cabinet “is working and will continue to work, and all of its members are very committed to its processes and its decisions”. We can only hope that this mindless breakdown in process and communication is not repeated.
On Monday, Mr Morrison participated in a “virtual” leaders’ summit with Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Singapore has been lauded for its response to COVID-19. In an interview with foreign editor Greg Sheridan, Mr Lee said the willingness of citizens to listen to the government, trust mainstream media and accept explanations for restrictions had helped to contain spread of the virus. But he said it was important to build on social capital and trust during the crisis. “Because if you do not, and people start to doubt what they are being told, or think that facts are being withheld, you will be in deep trouble very quickly,” Mr Lee said.Trust in government is at low levels; some of it here is self-inflicted by the political class. But this crisis demands higher standards of politicians, in fact by everyone in a decision-making role, and those who have a platform to influence public opinion and behaviour. Too many self-important talking heads, and armchair generals are blithely telling audiences that authorities must impose scorched-earth shutdowns or people will die. The egotists admonish our medical experts and grandstand at every policy turn. Flattening the onset of pundit vanity is becoming an alarming distraction.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Hasten slowly on divisive issues	The Australian	President Joe Biden must concentrate on Covid-19 and the economy It is no surprise that US Republicans are dismayed over the blizzard of presidential executive orders signed by Joe Biden in his first few days in the White House. There is nothing unusual about his use of the orders. They are what incoming US presidents use to reverse the signature policies of their predecessors, giving immediate effect to the mandate given to them by voters. But the 29 issued so far by Mr Biden far outstrip the five Barack Obama issued in the first few days of his first term, and the single executive order Donald Trump made immediately after he entered the Oval Office in 2017. There is widespread support for Mr Biden’s use of executive orders to ramp up and expand the Trump administration’s flawed response to the COVID-19 catastrophe, placing it on a WWII “wartime” footing. The promise of one million COVID-19 shots a day for his first 100 days is vital. But there are fears the new President could be going too far, too fast in other policy areas, undermining the widely held hopes for post-Trump bipartisanship and national healing.
Leading Republican senator Marco Rubio, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, said on Friday: “President Biden is talking like a centrist, but he’s governing like someone from the far left.” His view was echoed by Republican House of Representatives leader Kevin McCarthy, who warned Mr Biden’s promise to unify the nation after the divisions of the Trump years “can’t happen when he is making a liberal Democrat agenda his priority” through his slew of executive orders.
“What unity is there in closing the pipeline?” Mr McCarthy asked, referring to Mr Biden’s day one order revoking the Trump administration’s permit for the controversial 1900km Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. “You lose more jobs, the energy cost goes up.’’ The pipeline is a touchstone of Mr Biden’s policy intentions. Under Mr Obama, who barred the pipeline, the US State Department found on five occasions it would have no impact on greenhouse emissions. Yet unilaterally revoking Mr Trump’s permission for it to go ahead is now front and centre of the Biden administration’s return to the Paris accord under its new climate tsar, John Kerry.
Doing so is far from the only change causing angst among those who are concerned that despite his commitment to governing from the centre, Mr Biden, in some areas, is doing the bidding of the Democrats’ far left led by senator Bernie Sanders. Trump backers are indignant over executive orders that immediately reverse enhanced immigration controls, such as defunding Mr Trump’s “big, beautiful” border wall and lifting his ban on travellers from Muslim-majority nations. Thousands of would-be migrants are gathering south of the Mexican border in the belief the Biden administration will reopen the gates. There is anger, too, over Mr Biden’s intention to open a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented Americans who arrived in the country as children, and his rescinding of Mr Trump’s so-called 1776 Commission report calling for a more patriotic syllabus in schools. Workplace discrimination on the basis of gender and sexual orientation has been outlawed while the White House has announced it will reverse a ban on funding for overseas family planning organisations that “perform or promote” abortion. Such actions were part of Mr Biden’s manifesto; economic recovery, however, is the main measure by which he will be judged.
Opinion in Washington is divided about the Democrats’ determination to use their control of congress to press ahead with Mr Trump’s Senate trial following his impeachment over the January 6 assault on the US Capitol. On one hand, he should not go unpunished for inciting the violence. And weekend revelations by The Wall Street Journal show the former president’s conduct was more outrageous than previously known. He tried to compel Department of Justice officials to launch action to reverse his election defeat. Infuriated, they threatened mass resignations. On the other hand, the trial, set to begin on February 8, could imperil the unity and bipartisanship Mr Biden said, in his inaugural address, would underpin his every action. The national shame of the onslaught on the heart of US democracy underlined the importance of bipartisanship and unity in confronting the many challenges facing the US, especially over COVID and the economy. With control of congress held by the Democrats by the slimmest of majorities, Mr Biden must be cautious. He needs to carry the country with him and not divide it further by acting precipitously. The US does not need a rerun of the Obama years.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
An extraordinary moment in US presidential history	The Australian	President Trump’s diagnosis will put him off the hustings In a private message to Donald Trump on Friday, Scott Morrison spoke for Australians when he wished the US President and wife Melania a “speedy and full recovery” from COVID-19. Mr Trump’s video message from hospital on Saturday US time, insisting he “feels much better now”, is hopefully a good sign he will be back on the campaign trail soon for the November 3 election. But nothing is certain amid the crisis that has followed his hospitalisation. He and others in the COVID cluster emerging at the heart of the White House must heed the lessons from their diagnoses with a virus that has infected 7.3 million Americans and killed 230,000 so far.
The September 27 White House Rose Garden ceremony at which Mr Trump announced Judge Amy Coney Barrett as his choice for the Supreme Court is believed to be at the epicentre of the outbreak. Eleven of the audience have since tested positive. They include Mr Trump’s personal assistant, Hope Hicks, re-election campaign head Bill Stepien, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and close adviser Kellyanne Conway. Three Republican senators also tested positive, halting voting for a week and throwing the confirmation process for Judge Barrett into doubt.
Taking their cue from Mr Trump’s attitude to mask-wearing, few of the 150 attendees at the function did so. Many embraced, ignoring social distancing. Masks are no assured defence against the pernicious virus. Neither is social distancing. But medical experts believe they help significantly.
An incumbent President being hospitalised with a potentially fatal illness a month from voting day takes the campaign into uncharted waters. The disaster may, as Cameron Stewart writes on Monday, underline Mr Trump’s inability to protect the public from the pandemic. On the other hand, patriotic Americans have a history of rallying around sick or injured presidents. The despicable reactions of some Trump haters, such as Hillary Clinton’s ex-staffer, Zara Rahim, might help him.
If Mr Trump became seriously ill and unable to do his job, he could, under the US Constitution’s 25th Amendment, notify congress. Vice-President Mike Pence would then become acting president until Mr Trump sent a second letter declaring he was able to resume his duties. If he were unable to issue the first declaration, the Vice-President and the heads of 15 major executive departments would be able to declare in writing that the President “is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. Mr Pence would become acting president immediately, as University of California Law professor John Yoo writes in Monday’s World section. The situation adds interest to Thursday’s debate between Mr Pence and 77-year-old Mr Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris. With voting under way, there is no certainty Mr Trump’s name could be removed from the ballot, even if he died or was unable to continue. Much would depend on the electoral college. As he says, the next few days will be crucial.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Biden’s chance for gun control	The Australian	President should follow John Howard’s lead on automatic weapons
Joe Biden is entitled to feel devastated after the latest mass shooting, in which 10 people were mindlessly slaughtered at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, by a 21-year-old man armed with deadly weapons intended for use on wartime battlefields. But the US President also should feel determined following the horrifying bloodbath, which came days after last week’s killing by another allegedly troubled lone gunman of eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in Atlanta, Georgia. After a pandemic lull, the mass shootings that bring the most powerful nation such discredit are starting up again. And the challenge to Mr Biden is to go where all his recent White House predecessors have failed to go and do something effective about gun control.
The massacre at the King Soopers store in Boulder and the Atlanta shootings epitomise all that is rotten and indefensible about US gun laws, or the absence of them. They are an indictment of the country’s gutless politicians and their failure to act.
Syrian-born Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, who has lived in the US most of his life and has a troubled background, was able to buy his Rutger AR-556 firearm, developed for use on battlefields, and another handgun six days before he embarked on the Boulder massacre. Among those he gunned down was a heroic first-responder policeman, the father of seven children.
Atlanta shooter Robert Aaron Long, also 21, did not even wait that long. He bought his weapon just before he launched his killing spree, such is the freedom with which even individuals known to be deranged can get their hands on deadly weapons in the US.
Mr Biden was right to demand the US congress not “wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take commonsense steps that will save lives in the future”. He also announced he was preparing executive orders if the usual self-serving political bickering again gets in the way of sensible gun-control measures. Mr Biden wants congress to pass legislation approved by the House of Representatives earlier this month that would expand background checks on gun purchasers. He also wants a ban on high-velocity assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines.
There is nothing revolutionary about the legislation. In 1994, a 10-year law banned such weapons. But when it expired in 2004, congress — then controlled by Republicans — declined to renew it. George W. Bush, president at the time, and his successor Barack Obama talked the talk on gun control but achieved little. During his term, Donald Trump was praised by the National Rifle Association as the best friend it ever had in the White House. The resurgence in mass shootings is the inevitable ongoing consequence of there being a staggering total of almost 400 million weapons in private hands in the US — far more than there are people. The Boulder and Atlanta massacres are part of the dreadful toll that, outside of a pandemic, normally results in at least 40,000 people killed in gun violence in the US each year. Even American courts are invariably feeble when ruling on anything perceived to challenge the second amendment right to bear arms. Yet the amendment was ratified in December 1791, when the firearms of the day were muskets and flintlock pistols. America’s founding fathers, when they enacted the amendment, could not have anticipated the murderous killing machines that are now so easily obtained. The litany of gun massacres is long and shameful. It brings disgrace to global perceptions of the US. Mr Biden, with his history of successfully working across party lines, is uniquely placed to achieve the congressional support for sensible gun control that should be a no-brainer for Republicans and Democrats alike, and should not provoke a divide between conservatives and liberals. After the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, John Howard displayed the political courage and determination needed to meet the challenge Australia confronted. Mr Biden should follow his example.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
World still in the dark on Covid	The Australian	Preventing further pandemics will be hard without a real investigation After 2.8 million deaths and 127 million infections, the last thing the world needed was another inconclusive report on the origins of COVID-19. But that is what WHO investigators have delivered in their final account of how the virus emerged. The outcome shows the abysmal failure of the WHO in dealing with the crisis, and China’s unwillingness to allow access to the truth. As US Secretary of State Tony Blinken said after early copies of the 319-page document were circulated: “We’ve got real concerns about the methodology and the process … including the fact that the government in Beijing apparently helped write it.” The report does not come close to explaining the emergence of a pathogen that has devastated so many nations. And until China provides the data needed, firmer conclusions will be difficult, pandemic experts agree. While not ruling it out entirely, the report lent credence to China’s denial of the Trump administration’s contention that the pandemic was most likely the result of a lab accident at the Wuhan Virology Institute. Such an accident, investigators said, was “extremely unlikely” because there was no record that any laboratory had been working with either the new coronavirus or a closely related virus. The investigators said they did not consider a hypothesis that the virus was deliberately engineered in a lab for release, because analyses of the genome had ruled that out. They concluded the virus was most likely spread from bats and then to humans via another small mammal species such as mink, raccoon dogs or ferret badgers, either on a farm or in the wild. That scenario, they said, has been seen in several viruses.
The team recommended more testing of possible animal sources. It also suggested further consideration of respiratory illness data from the World Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019. Beijing has claimed the US delegation to the Games might have brought the virus to Wuhan.
But the main thrust of the report, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus conceded, was to avoid reaching definitive conclusions about how the pandemic started and spread. That failure stems from the early days of 2020, when Dr Tedros went out of his way to praise Beijing’s handling of the pandemic, in a way that bore little relation to the truth. Beijing’s furious reaction when Scott Morrison sensibly proposed a global probe into what caused the pandemic was telling. Such an investigation remains as much in China’s interests as those of the rest of the world, to guard against future pandemics.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Covid-19 spike must not hurt national bounce-back	The Australian	Preventing poverty and minimising unemployment is vital The feeling of deja vu watching Melbourne shoppers hoard toilet paper is disheartening. It raises the spectre of going backwards or a return to lockdown, compounding grave damage already inflicted on the unemployed, struggling businesses, consumption and government revenue. The mini-spike in coronavirus cases in Victoria is a wake-up call for the public to persevere with precautions and to authorities. A responsible approach is vital — no more street marches, whatever the cause, should be tolerated for now. The June 6 spectacle sent the wrong signal to citizens who were already fed up with restrictions and isolation. Complacency returned. That said, the best favour the Andrews government and other states can do the nation is to press ahead prudently with opening up economic activity and interstate travel.
Talk of a “second wave” of COVID-19 in Victoria is off beam. Australia had more of a ripple than a first wave. Our last reported death from the virus was on May 23; l02 people have died out of 7486 cases. We need to be realistic. For as long as the virus remains prevalent across the world — more than 183,000 new cases were recorded in 24 hours on Sunday, mainly in the Americas and South Asia — outbreaks will occur on our shore. Good preparation by governments and the health system has ensured Australia has the testing, tracking, equipment and staff to cope. Testing must be quick and efficient. Learning from Victoria, those supposed to be in quarantine who break bounds must be fined.
Localised rings of containment, as Scott Morrison says, have always been part of the plan: it is vital to “run our economy, run our lives (and) run our communities alongside this virus … We can’t just shut up everything forever”. If health authorities deem lockdowns unavoidable after a week of double-digit increases in Victoria’s caseload, measures should be short, sharp and tightly centred. The only justification could be preventing the virus spreading. Victoria accounts for a quarter of the national economy. And however sobering it is to realise the state’s average daily rate of new cases per million people has almost caught up to that of Italy, as Rachel Baxendale reports, it should be remembered that Italy’s crisis is abating.
Australia’s senior federal health officers insist there is no medical reason to continue border shutdowns between states. Yet among overreactions to events in Victoria, West Australian Premier Mark McGowan stretched populism to absurdity, announcing the WA border, more than 2000km away, had been set to open on August 8 but “that had to change because of what’s going on in Victoria”. August 8 was ridiculously late; delaying it further is ludicrous. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is also in fantasy land, claiming her border closure has helped the state because it allowed her government to relax restrictions. Apart, that is, from $770m in tourist revenue being lost per month in Queensland and 5000 jobs lost across the nation. Interstate visitors make up 47.4 per cent of its domestic tourism market. As Tourism Tropical North Queensland chief executive Mark Olsen told The Australian recently, when the mercury drops in the south “the phones in Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef usually ring off the hook”. The current silence is devastating for jobs and households, especially when the industry has paid to be COVID ready.
Nor is it feasible, as some have suggested, to stop only Victorians from travelling. Tourism Research Australia data shows Victorians spent more on tourism in NSW, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory last year than local residents. More fundamentally, our continent’s tyranny of distance makes interstate travel an intrinsic part of our working and personal lives. Australia’s flattened economy is too precarious for petty border skirmishes such as Daniel Andrews’s crack: “Why would you wanna go to South Australia anyway?” But he is correct to point out that Victoria, like the rest of the nation, is pursuing the suppression and not the eradication of COVID-19 — a strategy endorsed by national cabinet. People in different states will probably have to live with the reality and threat of COVID-19 for months or years. That is why the way this spike is handled matters. It will set the standard for managing further outbreaks.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
OUR VIEW Smooth work undercut by border gaps	Wanganui Chronicle	Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has again shown herself to be a confident navigator through the latest coronavirus squall.
Her disarming communication skills, command of her subject detail and political instincts set her apart. Even in a comparison with the leaders of much larger countries, her abilities stand out.
Ardern makes it all look a bit effortless, yet even a star player needs good support. With the notable exception of the reliable Finance Minister Grant Robertson, Ardern cannot help but show up her colleagues and rivals.
Covid-19 has been a very tough stress test for politicians everywhere in the world. The virus ruthlessly exposes incompetence, inconsistent messaging, lack of attention to detail, shortcuts and questionable judgement and strategy.
Here the coronavirus has claimed one health minister, now the new one is feeling the heat.
Ardern said on Friday that genomic testing had found no links to previous cases of community spread, or to border facilities.
But the Auckland outbreak has coincided with revelations over the testing of border staff with Minister of Health Chris Hipkins admitting they should have occurred earlier and more often.
On Saturday he said only 60 per cent of people working at a quarantine hotel had been tested and he “absolutely accepts responsibility” for the lack of testing.
“It is frustrating that we were not getting the testing ... we expected to be happening,” he said. By today, all frontline staff are expected to have been tested.
The border, managed isolation and quarantine is collectively the area of most concern to health experts and the public. So it seems strange that the Government has not been as laser-focused on that area as it could have been.
People’s sense of safety in the pandemic is tied up with the idea of entry points being watertight.
The Government has sometimes seemed to be playing catch-up and making running repairs on border issues: Testing of arrivals, escapees, and now tests for workers. Debates over who to give entry exemptions to and who pays the costs of quarantine have nibbled away at the sense of unity.
Overall, as the country waits out the incubation period of our coronavirus outbreak, the news so far has been positive with an impressive amount of testing and trace work suggesting it is a single incident and is being contained. Infected people are now being shifted into quarantine.
The Government has — belatedly compared to other countries — started trying to get the public used to wearing masks. There is finally a push to make the tracing app more user-friendly by ensuring businesses display QR code posters.
Perhaps our general great success against a difficult foe has made the missteps more glaring.
The basic approach to go hard and early is the right one. Stamping on the virus is the only way for normal life to resume.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

Andrews emergency plan is a power grab too far	The Australian	Principles of responsible government must be maintained
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews’s plan to extend the sweeping emergency powers he is employing to suppress the spread of COVID-19 is ill conceived. In principle, it is a gross assault on the accountability of the executive to parliament and, ultimately, to the people. At its heart it is a naked attempt to govern by executive decree. It offends the principles of legality and the rule of law that were incorporated into our constitutional framework when the nation was formed in 1901.
Our Constitution created the commonwealth and the states. But few people would grasp how wide the plenary powers of state governments are under their constitutions. There are few checks and balances on state parliaments, whose broad powers to ensure “peace, order and welfare” are almost limitless. Our High Court held, when considering the emergency response of the Rudd government to the global financial crisis of 2008, that elements of the common law and the English Bill of Rights of 1689 had been imported into our Constitution. In an emergency, parliaments may delegate broad executive powers to the executive. But such grants must be interim, finite measures.
What Mr Andrews wants, arguably, is excessive. It is especially problematic when Victoria needs a vigilant, competent opposition. The parlous state of the Victorian Liberal Party is a scandal with national implications. Only the Legislative Council, through a coalition of crossbenchers, looks likely to ensure that fundamental democratic norms are maintained against the hubris of a premier who faces no credible opposition. Probity aside, even in pragmatic terms this power grab is likely to be counter-productive. Lockdown fatigue is an identifiable side effect of the dehumanising impact of the benign house arrest in force in much of Victoria. Across time, people become weary and contemptuous of restrictions. This fuels complacency as regards social distancing, and even deliberate risk-taking by some seeking the illicit fruits of freedom. The cost to the national economy is already staggering. Nationally, the business sector is reeling from the collateral effects of lockdown in Victoria, which is set to suffer a 9.2 per cent hit to state output this financial year. The mental health costs of sustained restrictions on movement and social contact are incalculable. And they will spiral if the Premier gets his way in extending the state of emergency for another year.
In his desire to extend the suite of restrictions on the liberties of Victorians, Mr Andrews has revealed a disturbing thirst for extra power and diminished accountability. His government’s performance does not warrant confidence that such carte blanche would be handled with regard for constitutional norms or due process. The Premier generally has shown more skill in suppressing civil liberties than in suppressing the pandemic.
It was Paul Keating who quipped that it was dangerous to get “between a premier and a bucket of money”. Perhaps Scott Morrison’s version of that scornful jest might be that nothing is as dangerous as to stand between a premier and more executive authority.
Mr Andrews has presided over a disjointed, occasionally chaotic response to the pandemic. Victoria’s rates of infection and fatalities, which have been significantly worse than those in any other state or territory, have occurred despite his invocation of emergency powers and the imposition of a curfew.
For all that, a bizarre, supine social media cult has grown around the Premier, in which legitimate media questioning of his leadership or calls for accountability from his ministers and bureaucrats are met with vile abuse by his Twitter fans. The irony of simultaneously ranting about the conditions on Manus Island while fawning on a premier who has effectively incarcerated his state’s population seems to be lost on this self-styled moral majority. The Premier’s demands for an extension of the state of emergency, fortunately, seem doomed to failure, with the upper house looking likely to reject the legislation. This is no surprise. Even Bill Shorten baulked at the disproportionate response. It is time to regain perspective. The COVID-19 pandemic is neither a war nor an existential threat to our national survival. We have weathered greater crises that threatened our freedoms and sovereignty. On those occasions, paradoxically, more legislative and fiscal power was concentrated in Canberra. Yet in 2020 various states have closed their borders unilaterally, content to damage the national economy while greedily accepting enormous sums of federal funding to underwrite their parochial folly. State recalcitrance and selfishness seem to have spread more widely than the virus. Long-term damage to the economy and to principles of responsible government seems likely to endure well beyond this crisis. If in winning the battle against COVID-19 we forfeit fundamental liberties, then we will lose something important from our way of life.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
The promise and pitfalls of Modern Monetary Theory	The Australian	Printing money doesn’t reduce deficits or create lasting jobs Invoking a Keatingism, last weekend Alan Kohler observed that every pet shop galah is now talking about Modern Monetary Theory, essentially governments printing money to pay for their spending, rather than funding themselves by taxation and borrowing. In our pages across a fortnight, we’ve published a range of commentators and policy advocates on the promise and pitfalls of MMT. It’s an idea, not that new, frankly, that has been behind the progressive push for a universal basic income and the Green New Deal in the US. Now this arcane idea is in the spotlight. On Saturday, wealth editor James Kirby even teased out what MMT might mean for your portfolio. “You need to be in front of the curve whatever you might think of the theory,” Kirby advised. That’s why we’ve encouraged debate: to look at an issue in the round, so readers can engage with ideas and be prepared for a world being reshaped by COVID-19.
Kohler is a fan of MMT. He argues JobKeeper and JobSeeker should be turned into a permanent federal job guarantee. Economics editor Adam Creighton, while not denouncing the theory as “bollocks”, reminded readers there was no free lunch. Even “money creation” is another form of borrowing. Drawing on the history of Weimar hyperinflation and examining rising public indebtedness in the time of corona, on Friday Henry Ergas argued the present situation was one in which governments’ ability to spread the cost of shocks between the present and the future has quite properly come into its own. Still, those costs can’t be ignored. “The mere fact governments in the advanced economies are covering a growing share of their deficits by borrowing from central banks — that is, by printing money — hardly makes them disappear,” Ergas noted.
Seizing the MMT moment, Cape York indigenous leader Noel Pearson last weekend made the case for a jobs guarantee, based on the work of local economist William Mitchell, whom we also published. Pearson argued governments should fund real jobs at the minimum wage to all unemployed Australians. Policymakers had used the unemployed as “buffer stock” for 50 years to keep inflation in check. “My people, consigned to welfare and structural exclusion from the real economy in the post-60s era of growing unemployment, have been victims of a public policy choice for which there existed a better and more humane alternative,” he wrote. Like Pearson, we have railed against the scourge of passive handouts and the strife that comes from intergenerational welfare. He is right in celebrating, and pursuing, the majesty of Martin Luther King’s claim in “solving the problem of racial injustice with the solution of universal, colourblind, economic justice”.
Yet Pearson’s is a mammoth, brave proposal, one that would redefine the role of the state. In the midst of the greatest social and economic calamity in 90 years, there has to be more scope for imagination and ambition in our policy approach. Unemployment will be high for years and its misery will fall most on the vulnerable, young people, and those living in remote areas. Make-work schemes such as Community Development Employment Projects have had their day. But there are other hurdles to a full employment scheme as envisaged by Pearson and Mitchell. The cost and administration, regardless of which level of government was in control, would be vast. Work incentives would be skewed in all sorts of ways. What happens to people who don’t want to work or train? Welfare, even with its manifest faults, helps those who fall through the cracks. While the policy edifice is failing indigenous people, a neat solution is a chimera. MMT certainly has theoretical appeal, even for rational, hard-nosed economists. It’s axiomatic there is no budget constraint in such a model. But we live in a complex, even messy world. Imagine telling a populist National, a clueless Green or a Labor class warrior there is no spending limit. How can you hope to manage the economy? At least it could lead to more candour on budget night: “The four deficits I announce tonight” or even “Australia is back from the dead and still in the red!” The value of MMT, as Kohler noted, is it lifts the curtain on our financial system, if not on policymakers. As an analytical tool the theory has merit. But with printing money in the real world, there is a day of reckoning or just a long stagnation. Our income can never be guaranteed, so we need to earn and pay our way.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Fair play over Victorian border	The Australian	Problematic as it is, the diagnosis of a fourth COVID-19 case linked to the Australian Open tennis tournament will be handled sensibly by Victorian authorities. A total of 62 close contacts are now in hard quarantine in their hotel rooms, including 47 players. And COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria Commissioner Emma Cassar has warned there is “zero tolerance” for players breaching hotel quarantine rules.
Amid serious concerns about training restrictions, two-time champion Victoria Azarenka showed the right spirit: “Made it to Melbourne! Thank you everyone so much for making it happen. I can only imagine how many hours of work and compromise it took for us to be here! Thank you.’’ Staging the Open, from February 8, is another step in the nation’s COVID recovery.
That said, after allowing more than 1000 elite tennis players and their support staff to fly into Melbourne, there is no excuse, as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says, for Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to delay Victorians stranded in NSW from returning home. In the interests of consistency, he should lift restrictions on Monday morning, after easing constraints for travel between Queensland and Victoria on Saturday. Australia now has “no remaining coronavirus hotspots”, Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Sunday. There is no justification, then, for hard borders. The fact that thousands of Victorians remain trapped in NSW, at heavy personal cost and inconvenience, because they are in areas designated as red zones by the Andrews government, is onerous and disproportionate with the COVID caseload in NSW. It’s time for fair play on borders.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Covid menace in check as NSW gears up for 2021	The Australian	Professional testing and tracking are preventing a disaster unfolding
Slowly but surely, NSW appears to be winning the battle against coronavirus on Sydney’s northern beaches. After the testing of another 24,000 people in 24 hours, seven new locally acquired cases were reported on Sunday morning. The skills and tireless work of the state’s testing and contact-tracing teams, outlined by NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant, are impressive and reassuring. Such efforts managed to avert a COVID-19 catastrophe at Christmas. And, at this stage, it has avoided a major surge in cases with serious social and economic disruption. While inconvenient, the restrictions in place in Sydney remain proportionate to the threat the virus poses to lives, health, jobs and the economy. On Sunday, local councils’ erection of blockades around areas normally packed on New Year’s Eve as vantage points for viewing the city’s fireworks spectacular suggests most people will be watching on television. Unnecessary risks through potential super-spreading must be avoided. What has made the outbreak, which totalled 122 cases by Sunday, more onerous are the unnecessary and costly hard border closures against the Greater Sydney area by other states at peak school holiday time.
There are no health orders stopping beaches being open for swimming, exercise or recreation, NSW Health has made clear. Northern beaches residents may also leave home to shop, work, seek medical attention or for compassionate reasons. But there is no room for complacency. Suburbs well outside the area, including Balmain, Rozelle and Drummoyne, are among new venues added to the NSW Health alerts list. And health authorities are no closer to tracking down the original source of the cluster.
A lockdown like that imposed by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews during Melbourne’s second wave would be insufferable. Access to beaches, however, does not excuse the selfish and loutish behaviour of about 200 backpackers who crowded into an illegal beach party at Byron Bay on Sunday, leaving piles of rubbish behind. Just hours earlier, health authorities had warned that mass gatherings could easily become “super-spreader events”. The impromptu gathering at Bronte Beach in Sydney’s eastern suburbs on Christmas Day, broken up by riot police, was equally stupid. Those tempted to attend such events should look at the predicaments of those across the US, Britain, Europe and other nations to grasp what is at stake. More than 80 million people worldwide have had COVID-19 and the virus has claimed 1.7 million lives. In the US, 330,000 people — about one in 1000 Americans — have died from among 18.8 million cases. Britain, in the grip of a highly infectious new strain of the virus reportedly brought in from South Africa, recorded 34,693 new COVID cases on Boxing Day. And that was despite widespread business closures and tight limits on socialising.
EU nations began vaccinating their most vulnerable groups of citizens on Sunday as a reputedly more contagious coronavirus variant spread internationally, and the World Health Organisation warned that the current pandemic would not be the last.
Australians have much to be thankful for. But our gratitude does not extend to sharing the admiration of the Chinese Communist Party Politburo, which has congratulated itself on its “extremely extraordinary” success in handling the COVID-19 outbreak. “At the critical moment … the Party Central Committee took a long-term view … achieving an extremely extraordinary glory in this extremely unusual year,” state news agency Xinhua reported after the two-day Politburo meeting. China boasts it has crushed the virus, a claim that might or might not be true. The CCP’s statement comes ahead of a World Health Organisation probe into the disease’s origins. Scott Morrison was one of the first international leaders to urge such an investigation — a call that appears to have triggered the CCP’s trade retaliation against imports from Australia. At the same time, by coincidence, a Chinese citizen journalist, Zhang Zhan, who reported on Wuhan’s outbreak, has been detained since May and is expected to go on trial on Monday. Ms Zhang is a former lawyer who travelled to Wuhan in February to report on the early stages of the outbreak through social media platforms that are banned in China. From 253,235 COVID tests in NSW last week, 61 new cases were identified. The source of 53 cases is known; but not of the other eight. Ongoing high levels of testing are vital, as Dr Chant and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian point out. Extensive testing adds to the confidence of medical authorities and the public that new strands of the insidious disease are not making their way through the community undetected.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Biden’s project is to enlist the nation, not the Squad	The Australian	Progressives cannot suspend politics by demonising rivals Zoom back, for a moment, from the Trump team lawyering up and zone out Joe Biden’s Hallmark card slogans. Is the US election cause for hope or fear? It’s not only America looking for a way through polarised politics, economic challenges, bad actors abroad and elite-mainstream cultural conflict at home. Many nations, Australia included, are in uncharted territory with plenty of risks ahead. If we are to find our way, we need to understand what’s happening. That means talking to people we don’t agree with and expecting that the views of opponents will be well articulated in the media. It feels like a win to quash “wrongthink”, but in the end a world view not exposed to regular reality tests leads only to miscalculation and nasty surprises. Open debate and accurate reporting of a wide range of facts and opinion are essential tools for a society that functions. The failure of groupthink media, not just in the US, is stark.
Donald Trump has a legal entitlement to challenge vote results but most people have factored in a Biden presidency with the Republicans still holding the Senate. If mastery of congress is denied the Democrats, that’s a reason for hope. It might help keep in check the far left of the party with its authoritarian tendency and reckless utopianism. The firebrand “Squad” of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and their adoring media allies were hoping a “blue wave” of voters would underwrite a radical mandate for more dismal identity politics, leftist policing of free speech and the economic deadweight of a “Green New Deal”.
The promised blue wave didn’t come and American voters seem to have produced the potentially pragmatic power balance that is the mark of a democracy. Mr Biden, regarded as a decent human being, looks like securing a clear endorsement on the popular vote and in the electoral college. If Mr Trump goes, Trumpist politics will remain a force. It wasn’t only Democrats who bridled at the president’s conduct and style but many voters ignored leftist hyperbole about him, just as they didn’t get too distracted by his antics. Told by the commentariat that the commander-in-chief was a white supremacist on the brink of a coup, many Americans just saw an administration with some achievements amid the incompetence and recognised the Democrats’ own vulnerabilities. Higher turnout was supposed to unleash a pent-up surge of progressivism but it also brought countercurrents of conservatism.
This shouldn’t have been such a surprise. Ever since Hillary Clinton was denied “her turn” as president and Brexit voters showed themselves not enamoured of the European ideal, politics on the right has been more populist and nationalist, and multilateral projects and Friedmanite fiscal virtue have fallen out of favour. In Britain last year Boris Johnson swept to power with startling support in the north of England and a friendlier Tory take on public services. In Australia, Scott Morrison defied the pundits and doggedly worked the mainstream to win office the same year, and he too has been a pragmatist loosening the public purse strings, prodded by COVID-19. The common thread is centre-left parties with prominent activists not cultivating the centre but denouncing it as hateful and bigoted. The Biden campaign avoided this rhetoric but the Democrats seem to have paid a price for the relentless identity politics driving those “mostly peaceful protests” in US cities. While white leftists justified violence and rioting, it fell to black leaders to deplore pointless destruction of city precincts where many black people live those lives that matter. But elite commentary insisted November 3 was nothing but a verdict on the “racist” in the White House.
Exit polls suggest Mr Trump improved his vote among blacks, Latinos and gays and lesbians, with only white men giving him less support after four years of supposed white supremacy. Those polls may not be accurate but the panicky reinterpretation by race-obsessed anti-racists was telling. One New York Times writer suggested the surge in minority support for Mr Trump was proof of “the power of white patriarchy”, as if these black voters were all Uncle Toms. Another line was that “white Cubans” were hiding in the Latino category. Revulsion at the reductionism of skin-pigment voting assumptions was probably a factor in some minority support for Mr Trump.
The Manichean tendency to see a stark divide between enlightened progressives and the bigoted remainder is a serious threat to the success and competence of centre-left parties. There is no such thing as the end of politics, in which one sanctimonious group declares others hateful and refuses to engage in compromise and an attempt to balance competing interests. This denial of reality has a lot to do with intemperate social media, and can be seen at work in Kevin Rudd’s and Malcolm Turnbull’s talk of a royal commission into journalism. Garbed as a formal inquiry, this is more like an online campaign to deter independent coverage of progressive orthodoxy and rehabilitate their records as deeply flawed leaders.
Internal party management and realism in reform will also be vital for Mr Biden if he is to make progress on real-world issues such as health, education and lifting up the poor. It looks as if he’ll have to do business with Republican senators. He made the right centrist noises about this in his victory speech and we’ve heard much about his record of working across the aisle. A crucial test will be appointment of effective moderates to his cabinet. Mr Biden will come under pressure not only from a Trumpist Senate but from radicals within his own party. They learned nothing from the defeat of 2016 and they will catastrophise negotiation, let alone reversal in congress. That Mr Biden is unlikely to seek a second term may help him stand firm against progressive folly; it may speed and intensify the power struggle within the party. The risks are many but hope remains. At its best, the presidency is an engine of American achievement and, for all the conflict and dissension, it is still an international beacon.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
SAS voices cut through the fog	The Australian	Proper legal processes must resolve claims of war crimes At last the fog has been pierced by some straight talk. In the finest tradition of the Special Air Service Regiment and the Australian Army, an unidentified group of operators has punctured the obfuscation surrounding allegations of atrocities by Australian troops in Afghanistan. In a blunt message published online by The Australian, a group of current and former serving members of the SAS who served in Afghanistan made clear their frustration at the lengthy trial by media to which they have been subjected while the Brereton report has been prepared. The operators’ identities must be protected because of secretive counterterrorist operations they may have to execute on Australian soil. But exasperation has forced them to break cover. They are sick of years of smears and guilt by association: “We are not war criminals, nor have we ever set our morality aside. We are professional volunteer soldiers who frequently upheld the values of the Australian Army during a 10-year expeditionary campaign in the Middle East, despite the absence of any clear definition of victory.” That clarion call is in stark contrast to the innuendos that have circulated about them in recent years. Those who qualify to wear the sandy beret of the SAS Regiment are the bravest and best that this nation produces to defend our way of life. As they describe it, they are “the operational eyes and ears of the ADF and the Australian government”. That imposes an exacting standard of integrity. In their words, “without truth in reporting we are nothing”. It is timely that those who have faced a ruthless enemy are being heard.
In pursuing allegations of war crimes, the loudest voices have been those of ambitious journalists, while the investigation by the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force has taken its tortuous path. It is disturbing that a well- paid consultant, Samantha Crompvoets, commissioned by Defence to interview members of our special forces, saw fit to discuss her sensitive findings on the Nine Network’s 60 Minutes on Sunday. This, as the justice process was about to be initiated. Who authorised her emotive foray into the public domain? Why now, as action that may culminate in jury trials is about to start? Again, the operators spoke from the heart: “We also believe the same principle of truth in reporting should be embraced by the media, so as to not impugn the reputation of the SASR as a whole or inadvertently imply improper behaviour committed by former or serving members. Equally, we applaud accurate portrayals of misconduct provided it is supported by appropriate context and evidence.” It was heartening to hear Scott Morrison warn against tarring thousands of brave, patriotic Australians with one brush. The Prime Minister made it clear that while there appeared to be evidence of war crimes, this must be determined through legal processes. That must embrace trial by jury and the presumption of innocence. Yet how can any of those about whom rumours have swirled for years hope to receive fair treatment when selected journalists have been extensively briefed in a way that appears to exonerate senior leaders while incriminating a handful of non-commissioned officers and troopers? That is why the unnamed operators demand: “Just as we embrace truth in reporting, we demand our leadership to do the same. Leaders are bound in their duty to convey what we have seen and reported, and we hold them to the same standards to which we hold ourselves.” That is fair. It is easily forgotten that the senior officer who initially became concerned about irregularities in administration of the SAS, former major-general Jeff Sengelman, identified serious failures in command at Swanbourne Barracks. It was he who commissioned Dr Crompvoets’ study. There were failures in the conduct of the war in Afghanistan, emanating from political leaders who used the SAS as a “flag in the sand” to maintain our alliance obligations to the US, while not providing clear strategic objectives to the military. And senior commanders repeatedly certified these specialist forces fit for multiple tours of duty despite signs it was taking a terrible physical and mental toll. The Chief of the Defence Force, General Angus Campbell, must provide leadership worthy of his men when he addresses matters in the Brereton report on Thursday. Let justice be done though the heavens may fall.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
ABC dances with digital wolves	The Australian	Public broadcaster’s news content is paid for by taxpayers ABC managing director David Anderson has made a cheeky dash for cash late in the game, arguing Google and Facebook should now pay for the public broadcaster’s content that they exploit on their platforms. We have some sympathy for this view, but only in as much as the monopolist privateers of the digital realm should be halted in their plunder of original material, such as news, that is a social good and is very expensive to produce. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission is developing a revenue-sharing agreement between the tech titans and the media industry, including News Corp Australia, publisher of The Australian. A draft mandatory code, a world-first scheme for fair payment, is expected before the end of the month.
Let’s be clear why the ACCC has gone down this path. It is to end abuse of market power that has obliterated the funding model of commercial news media. This troubling development has dire implications for the free flow of information and our liberal democracy. The competition watchdog estimates the digital superpowers have 71 per cent of a $9bn local online advertising market. Our parent has called for the tech giants to pay media companies $1bn a year; Nine Entertainment chairman Peter Costello has put the figure at $600m. The issue has been bitterly fought, especially as the content pirates have dodged and weaved over several years, here and overseas. The Morrison government lost patience with their bad faith in negotiating a voluntary code and called for the ACCC to impose a compulsory one.
The monopolists will be directed to share data, properly display news content and pay a reasonable price for it. There will be penalties for breaches. Given the ABC has not lost a cent in revenue to these trillion-dollar thieves, it’s a bit rich to be insinuating itself into the revenue-sharing deal at this stage. Similarly, the ABC, in its submission to the ACCC’s 2018 digital platforms inquiry, said it had emerged unscathed from the rise of Google and Facebook; instead the ABC had been able to reach more viewers and readers. Not only that, the public broadcaster has spent taxpayer funds on improving rankings of its news content in search engines — at the expense of publishers trying to make a dollar. Not prudent or kind, but that’s an executive decision about how the ABC’s precious $1bn a year is spent.
No doubt a slight tightening of belts at Aunty has brought on a desperate hunt for funds and switch in rhetoric. Two weeks ago the ABC revealed a five-year strategic plan, including up to 250 editorial, production and executive job losses and relocation of staff from its Sydney headquarters to around the country by 2025. Austerity rules in Mediaville, particularly among profit-driven outfits such as our own. But the ABC is in clover compared with the private sector. Sure, there is a moral case for the social media predators to make a contribution for ABC news content, notwithstanding the company tax they contribute. Perhaps the digital wolves could offer the ABC a tidy rebate, to save money for taxpayers on its pointless search manipulation. Mr Anderson claims any extra revenue would be reinvested in public interest journalism. How do we know it would? In any case, the social good the ABC provides across many platforms is already paid for and guaranteed, year in, year out. That’s not the case for the commercial sector, with COVID-19 accelerating the shutdown of titles and job losses. Far from consumers turning away from traditional news outlets, the public appetite for our stories and images has never been greater. Of course, the ABC can break from the herd and do its own content deal at the margin. But that would injure other publishers, would be against the spirit of the ACCC’s conclusive findings and would allow Google and Facebook to accrue even more market power. That’s not in anyone’s interest, least of all a public hungrier than ever for engaging, around-the-clock and reliable news and information, to make sense of a world that is being remade before our eyes.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Inept provincial leaders to be exposed by health crisis	The Australian	Public hospitals will be inundated with COVID-19 patients
State government is a simple realm, encapsulated in a single word: services. Former NSW premier Neville Wran, in office from 1976 to 1986, said his legacy was “we made NSW a slightly better place in which to live”. “Nifty” did that by delivering services, concentrating on three Ps: petrol, power and public transport. It was a different era but the essence of governing is competency; no need for flashy rhetoric. State politics is a place for technocrats, uppity mayors and officials who mouth a new lingo — “putting customers first”. Of the current crop, Victoria’s Daniel Andrews has got the basics right most often, even though he’s prone to indulging niche causes.
Lamentably, this tier of government is a theatre for infantile games, endless plots and subdistrict grifting. Premiers and chief ministers will be exposed by the coronavirus pandemic. Yet how well they and their interconnected systems respond to the medical, social and economic emergency is literally a matter of life and death. Our success in containing COVID-19 also depends on what leaders bring to the broader fight through the national cabinet and other platforms. With our largest state the epicentre of infection, accounting for 43 per cent of the national total, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is under immense scrutiny and pressure to perform. She has confused the public on schools and appeared immobilised last week as a human tsunami washed over Bondi Beach and elsewhere.
But the epitome of her ineptness was the handling of 2700 cruise passengers from the Ruby Princess a week ago. It was a catastrophic failure by NSW officials. One passenger from the ship died on Tuesday and at least 133 others, dispersed around the country, are infected with COVID-19. At a closed Liberal meeting, Ms Berejiklian blamed Australian Border Force officials for lax screening. That’s not leadership. As one of her colleagues told Yoni Bashan, “it’s arse-covering”. Ms Berejiklian then fudged and fiddled, claiming a need for better co-operation between agencies. ABF commissioner Michael Outram provided pertinent facts and context about the screening system scandal. NSW officials did not allow doctors and nurses to board the vessel to take swabs of passengers, and take those swabs for results, before deciding to allow passengers to disembark. By contrast, he said the handling of cruise ships in Victoria and Western Australia had been done very well by local officials.
Failures in NSW processes and governance were apparent during the Black Summer bushfires. Hazard reduction burns were not carried out ahead of the fire season. As we reported last month, volunteers were sent to firefronts with outdated trucks and personal protective equipment, at-times poor radio communications and substandard technological capabilities, despite multiple reviews calling for urgent upgrades. Yet during the crisis NSW ministers were grandstanding on climate change and constantly throwing state and federal colleagues under a bus. Sadly, this is NSW politics as usual. Canberra’s systems also have been inadequate during the pandemic. Surges at Centrelink offices and serial crashing of websites prove Canberra’s existing infrastructure — a vaunted structural feature of both fiscal rescue packages — cannot keep pace with the demand. Nor can information rollout.
Still, blaming Canberra first is the default mode for states. Earlier this month, just after the national total of COVID-19 cases hit 50, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk blasted Canberra for failing to co-ordinate a response to the outbreak with the states through a Council of Australian Governments meeting. A week later COAG met, with Mr Morrison forming a national cabinet. Canberra is splitting extra health costs with the states. It’s said, never get between a premier and a bucket of money — or a bucket list of wishes. A tension between limited means and unlimited wants is a feature of federation. So is an expectation states are the delivery experts, especially for health, education, infrastructure and emergency services. Canberra’s recent forays, such as insulation batts, school halls and TV set-top boxes, have a special place in the policy hall of shame.Public hospitals will be inundated with COVID-19 patients. Can health systems cope? On the evidence so far, states are underdone in preparing for a huge caseload. The nation lacks intensive-care beds; there’s a scramble to create more of them and add to the stock of ventilators, protective masks and testing kits. Frontline clinicians fear hospitals will be overwhelmed, as they have been in other countries. Mr Morrison has moved to suspend non-urgent elective surgery to free up bed capacity. As well, he has been forced into rhetorical contortions to maintain the facade of national cabinet solidarity, which is fraying on some issues. He said on Wednesday “there might be a bit of difference at the edge” but the new vehicle was collegiate and essential for common action. Still, Mr Morrison conceded national cabinet was not a compulsory mechanism; states can go their own way, it’s how our federation is built. But stepping away from the herd will focus attention on the talent deficit disorder of provincial politicians. Their unreliability has already exposed vulnerable people to unnecessary risk.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Search for a better solution than hotel quarantine	The Australian	Purpose-built centres should not absolve the states of responsibility
The sight of a quarantine resident being escorted from a central Melbourne hotel wearing a plastic garbage bag over their head is emblematic of the urgent need for a reset. Evacuation of the Holiday Inn on Flinders Lane was necessary because of a malfunction in the building’s fire sprinkler system that damaged four of eight floors on Sunday. Buses were used to ferry residents, some as single occupants, to another hotel. Officials insist the plastic bag was the disrupted resident’s idea. They could have offered a blanket. As these events unfolded, 6.5 million Victorians were still under stage four lockdown because of a handful of COVID-19 cases in the state. Despite there being only two new infections yesterday, both among known contacts, Premier Daniel Andrews was unable to say whether the five-day lockdown would end as scheduled on Wednesday.
The hotel quarantine system was an ad hoc response introduced when knowledge of the COVID-19 virus was rapidly evolving. Using hotels helped to dull the financial impact for hospitality venues starved of paying guests by government restrictions on travel and movement. Things have moved on and there is now debate about whether special-purpose facilities should be built to play a longer-term role. So far this debate has centred on where new facilities should be located, what they should look like and who should take responsibility for running them. With the rollout of a vaccine program about to start, it is reasonable to ask how much longer a quarantine system will be required. Adoption of a vaccination passport and compulsory testing as a prerequisite for travel to Australia may reduce the need for quarantine considerably, but not yet.
As we reported on Tuesday, Australian Border Force data shows more than 253,000 citizens, residents and visa holders have travelled to Australia by air and sea since the hotel quarantine system was set up on March 28. In total, more than 461,000 Australians have returned home since Scott Morrison first urged them to come back on March 13, and 41,000 Australians registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are still waiting to return home from overseas. If ongoing quarantine facilities are required, the best response may be to have purpose-built sites with dedicated staff.
There has been favourable comment regarding the Northern Territory’s Howard Springs facility, where travellers are housed in single rooms with a private ensuite and access to fresh air. All arrivals are given face masks, which must be worn at all times when outside of an allocated room, with physical distancing of 1.5m, except for immediate family groups. There are no cooking facilities but meals are provided each day and residents have access to an online shopping service with Coles, Kmart and Big W. In Victoria, travellers are met at the airport, given a health screening and issued a direction and detention notice before being transferred to a hotel. While in quarantine arrivals must stay in their room and not allow anyone inside. Medical reasons and emergencies are the only exceptions, with heavy fines for transgressions. Arguments in favour of using city-based hotels for quarantine include proximity to the airport and medical services. It has been claimed that putting facilities in remote locations could increase the risk of wider exposure because of greater travel. This week, private individuals have proposed building facilities near established second-tier airports, including Avalon in Melbourne and Wellcamp airport at Toowoomba near Brisbane. Construction of appropriate quarantine facilities seems to be a sensible goal, particularly if they can provide a greater level of security for the community from the spread of COVID-19 and a higher level of comfort for those put into quarantine. Given that hotels currently being used are privately owned, there is no reason purpose-built centres could not be as well. But there appears to be another agenda by some states to push greater responsibility on to the commonwealth. West Australian Premier Mark McGowan said existing facilities under the control of the commonwealth, such as the Garden Island naval base in Sydney and the immigration detention centres at Northam in WA and Christmas Island, were the logical alternatives to the hotel quarantine systems run by each of the states. Given they fought to retain control, shifting from hotels to new centres should be no reason to absolve state leaders and their health authorities of responsibility to manage the centres and be liable for the quarantine outcomes they deliver. Nor should it be a reason to extend mandatory quarantine schemes for travellers beyond what is necessary.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Time to court overseas students	The Australian	Quashing the coronavirus is a major global advantage As universities set about offsetting their revenue losses from the impact of COVID-19 on international student numbers, they have an opportunity to capitalise on the silver lining the virus affords. The announcement by Cambridge University that it had suspended face-to-face teaching until the start of the 2021-22 academic year in September next year was a reminder that the pandemic has wreaked much greater damage in the UK and the US than here. Australia’s success in dealing with the coronavirus should be attractive to prospective students looking for a safe, healthy environment.
As nations open up, the market to attract foreign students will be more competitive because family budgets have suffered in the economic fallout of coronavirus. But to our advantage, lifestyle and wellbeing are important factors in determining where overseas students apply. As industry leader Phil Honeywood said last week, Australia has a chance to gain a “first-mover advantage” for its $40bn-a-year export industry if state governments unite to restart entry of international students. Mr Honeywood is chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia and chairman of the joint government-industry taskforce on the education sector’s pandemic response.
The issue is crucial for universities’ budgets. Universities Australia estimates its members will lose up to $4.6bn this year as a result of the virus, leading to the loss of 21,000 full-time academic, research and administrative jobs, Tim Dodd has reported. Despite the prospective losses as institutions put their houses in order, about 80 per cent of the international students who normally come to Australia in the first half of the year are here and studying, Scott Morrison told the National Press Club on Tuesday. “The way it’s talked about, you’d think they weren’t,’’ he said.
Universities are understandably concerned about an additional 90,000 students who, in a normal year, would be arriving to study in the second semester or third trimester. But as Dodd has reported, the NSW, Victorian and South Australian governments, as well as the Group of Eight universities, have put together proposals to reopen Australian borders to limited numbers of overseas students in coming months as a precursor to drawing larger numbers in time for the first semester next year. But the Queensland and West Australian governments — facing elections in October and next March respectively — have steered clear of such efforts, in keeping with their inward-looking attitudes to battening down state borders. They need to look beyond narrow, perceived populism.
The Go8 has proposed a “secure corridor” plan under which incoming students would be subject to self-funded quarantine. Universities also have capacity, through residential colleges and other student housing, to help arriving students with quarantine, especially in the mid-year vacation. Revitalising international education is crucial to Australia’s economic recovery from COVID-19. After resources, it is the nation’s largest export earner. University, TAFE, college and English-language students from overseas spent $40bn in Australia last year, including fees. The Prime Minister has pledged to work with the sector. The time is right for governments and universities to press the advantages of what Australia offers, including a healthy environment.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Palmer looms as wrecker for LNP in state election	The Australian	Queensland’s debt-ravaged budget needs serious attention
Annastacia Palaszczuk does not deserve such luck. As Queensland’s debt soars towards $100bn, with the effects of COVID-19 compounding Labor’s six years of public sector overspending, the state needs a serious economic debate in the lead-up to the October 31 election. For the first time voters will elect a government for four years, not three. At this stage the campaign is shaping as a dystopian nightmare for the Liberal National Party. Opposition MPs locked in behind leader Deb Frecklington on Monday. That was no surprise. Most voters know little about what she stands for but they would struggle to pick out the rest of her frontbench in a line-up. That includes the talented opposition tourism spokesman David Crisafulli, who wisely ruled out a challenge ahead of the poll despite being favoured by LNP headquarters.
The unanimous vote of confidence in Ms Frecklington solved one of her problems. But if she and her team are to be competitive against Labor after its two mediocre terms, the schizophrenia besetting the LNP’s administrative wing needs to be eliminated — now. Political parties’ machinations are matters best resolved internally. But LNP president David Hutchinson cannot continue to serve two masters — the party and Clive Palmer, who employs him as a consultant on the billionaire’s mothballed Coolum resort. Two members of the LNP state executive, Malcolm Cole and federal Nationals president Larry Anthony, also work for Mr Palmer through their communications and lobbying company, SAS Group, as Michael McKenna and Sarah Elks wrote on Tuesday. And LNP powerbroker and former president Bruce McIver, who has made it known he is dissatisfied with Ms Frecklington’s leadership, recently returned to be a director of one of Mr Palmer’s companies.
Mr Hutchinson’s irreconcilable conflict of interest is underlined by the fact Clive Palmer’s United Australia Party has called for nominations for candidates in the October poll. That could be problematic for Mr Hutchinson. In January, when McKenna broke the news that Mr Hutchinson was working for Mr Palmer, Ms Frecklington said the party president had advised “that if the Palmer United Party contest the Queensland state election he will resign from his employment”.
Mr Palmer’s record of policy fantasy underlines the fact he has nothing to offer Queenslanders, especially in the current straitened circumstances. Mr Palmer’s magic pudding policies have included cutting tax on second jobs by 50 per cent, abolishing fringe benefits tax, tax-deductible home loans, free university tuition, zonal taxation, $150-a-week pension rises, an $80bn splurge on national health spending and fast trains to service the nation’s major capital cities within an hour from centres 300km away. Such notions are nothing to do with the LNP. But Mr Palmer is determined to meddle. In a statement attacking Ms Frecklington on Monday he described himself as “a former LNP life member and National Party spokesman”.
Aside from his contradictory political involvements, Mr Palmer remains embroiled in litigation over his business interests. The Australian Securities & Investments Commission has charged Mr Palmer with breaches of the Corporations Act relating to his dealings with The President’s Club, which oversees the interests of villa owners, whose investments at his Coolum resort were affected by its “temporary closure” in 2015. A fortnight ago, liquidators of Queensland Nickel lost their bid to claw back more than $100m for creditors from Mr Palmer’s flagship company, Mineralogy. Mr Palmer, who was notable for his absence from parliament during his inglorious term as a federal MP, would be an unwelcome distraction in the Queensland campaign. Policymaking and debate in the nation’s third-largest state economy must focus on creating the conditions to maximise investment and jobs, control government spending and examine options, including asset leases or sales, to pay down the burgeoning debt. Energy policy and water also will be key election issues. Mr Hutchinson and others are running the risk of making it easy for Ms Palaszczuk to convince voters the LNP is dysfunctional and not ready to govern. The notion that the state has no alternative but to limp along with Labor, deeper into the red, for another term, is dispiriting.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
ALP’s pragmatic move on coal	The Australian	Queensland’s economy is a big challenge for the Treasurer Job security and private-sector investment have rarely mattered more, which is why Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick has done his state and the nation an important service in paving the way for a potential expansion of the state’s coal industry. In cementing rail and port monopolies for at least another decade, shielding the industry from cost rises, Mr Dick has sent a clear message to resource companies — Queensland is open for further investment and development.
Coal, worth $52bn a year to the state, is its largest export industry. And with Queensland’s debt heading towards $100bn, the commodity is vital to the budget bottom line.
After years of the Palaszczuk government playing up the potential of renewable energy, Mr Dick’s move marks a welcome return to pragmatism and common sense in Labor ranks over coal. Last year, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk finally was spurred into giving the Adani coalmine in the Galilee Basin the green light by Labor’s abysmal showing in regional areas in Queensland in the federal election. But the years of stonewalling and prevaricating, green lawfare and red tape damaged the state’s sovereign risk.
There is nothing like a looming election to focus politicians’ minds. And on October 31, state Labor will be defending marginal seats in central and northern Queensland, where Mr Dick’s decision on the lines and ports will be welcome. Even before COVID-19, lack of jobs was a major problem in those regions, especially for young people.
Less than a month after replacing Left faction leader Jackie Trad as treasurer, Mr Dick, from Labor’s Right, is going about his work efficiently and without fanfare, quietly gazetting his decision on the coal infrastructure this week. The 2670km central Queensland coal rail network links more than 50 mines to five major export ports, including four near Mackay and the Whitsundays. That region, where the tourism sector is a vital employer, has been hit hard by COVID-19. Businesses and workers there and throughout the state also are struggling under Ms Palaszczuk’s mulish refusal to reopen Queensland’s borders during the winter tourist season. Persevering with that shortsighted decision, when Queensland has just three active cases of COVID-19, is sapping confidence and costing jobs. As Mr Dick told Craig Johnstone on Thursday, the move to extend the coal infrastructure monopolies will have no material effect on the volume of coal exported. That will depend primarily on demand and price. In December, the International Energy Agency noted that a sharp fall in demand for coal for electricity in Europe and the US was being offset by rising demand in Asian markets, including India. Demand for coal would remain stable across the next five years, the IEA forecast. As Queensland Resources Council chief executive Ian Macfarlane says, the decision on the rail lines and ports will deliver clarity for the state’s coal customers about potential transport cost rises driving up prices. And before green groups rush to the barricades to launch more climate-change litigation, the move “would not limit any of the human rights potentially relating to climate change”, Mr Dick noted in the gazette. But the vote of confidence will give the industry much-needed certainty, encouraging more coalmining investment, and jobs, in the Bowen Basin and around coal ports.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
First post-Covid election a test of recovery strategies	The Australian	Queensland’s economy needs stronger leadership and vision Pundits venturing a wager on the Queensland election would be wise to factor a hung parliament into their calculations, alongside an outright Labor or Liberal National Party win. The contest, which officially starts on Tuesday, is wide open. In the unicameral parliament, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s Labor government holds 48 seats — a net loss of two would wipe out its majority in the 93-seat Legislative Assembly. Deb Frecklington and her LNP team have 38 seats and face an uphill battle to increase their tally by nine. The minor parties and independents will be hard to dislodge, especially the three Katter’s Australian Party members in the northwest. In the event of a tight result they would probably side with the LNP — at a high price, as Sarah Elks reports. Ms Palaszczuk is acutely aware of the possibility of a hung parliament and used it on Monday to garner support. “I cannot be any clearer, minority governments don’t work,” she said. Until political parties need to cut a deal.
Ms Palaszczuk, according to Newspoll in July, has a commanding lead over her rival as preferred premier. And while support for her hard-border COVID-19 lockdown is softening, it remains a positive. But not necessarily among swinging voters in regional seats along the state’s vast coastline, where the tourism and hospitality sector and its workers have suffered mightily as a result of Ms Palaszczuk’s pig-headed border lockdown. The Newspoll in late July gave the LNP a 51-49 lead. Voters in regional coastal seats also would be the beneficiaries of the state Opposition Leader’s campaign centrepiece so far: a 15-year, $33bn upgrade of the Bruce Highway to four lanes from Gympie to Cairns. The two-lane “highway” is dangerous in places and flood-prone. The policy, which would rely on 80 per cent federal funding, has won traction in regional communities disgruntled about missing out as Brisbane gains more tunnels and its $5.4bn Cross River Rail project advances. The Bruce Highway is good policy and good politics given the interest in infrastructure upgrades in post-COVID rebuilding. At state level, the promise is for a $50m feasibility study and to more than double annual spending on the road from $200m to $440m.
From Labor’s perspective, the pandemic is helping neutralise one of its weaknesses — state debt, which is heading towards $100m, mostly accumulated before the pandemic. This is also an LNP weakness. Like Labor, the opposition has ruled out asset leases or sales. Neither had it advanced a policy pre-COVID for reducing it or recovering Queensland’s long-lost AAA credit rating. In February Queensland Auditor-General Brendan Worrall delivered a grim assessment of the state’s finances, warning government spending had been outstripping revenue for two years. Unemployment has been well above the national average for too long. The state’s budgetary woes are closely tied to the ballooning public sector wages bill. The 14,000 public servants made redundant by Campbell Newman from 2012 to 2015 have been replaced at least twice over, by at least 35,000 more.
On the positive side for Labor, Cameron Dick, who replaced the ideological and accident-prone Jackie Trad as Treasurer in May, has done well in signalling that the state, including its coal industry, is open for business. After his promotion he sent a clear message to resource companies, cementing rail and port monopolies for at least another decade. Coal, worth $52bn a year to the state, is still Queensland’s largest export industry. If Labor is returned, Mr Dick will be in a good position as Treasurer to reboot the government’s union-dominated big-spending approach and adopt the pro-enterprise approach of predecessors such as Goss government treasurer Keith DeLacy.
During the campaign, issues raised in The Australian’s “The Mates State” would be worth pursuing and both sides have form. Labor mates have ridden high on the Palaszczuk government’s gravy train. Those on board include former Labor MP and strategist Mike Kaiser, who is now a KPMG partner; former Labor chief of staff Nicole Scurrah, who works for PwC; Evan Moorhead, the Palaszczuk government’s former chief of strategy, who is now a lobbyist and on a retainer for the ALP; and David Barbagallo, Ms Palaszczuk’s former chief of staff who did not properly declare his interests in a tech company that received $267,000 in government investment. On the LNP side, Ms Frecklington lacks a strong profile, but no more so than Ms Palaszczuk did five years ago when she led Labor to a surprise victory against Mr Newman, whose bombastic approach saw him snatch failure from the jaws of victory. Ms Frecklington’s hand was strengthened when she survived the recent push by former LNP president and Clive Palmer staffer Dave Hutchinson to oust her. But the most important battles are yet to come. She and Ms Palaszczuk have yet to present comprehensive plans for rebuilding the languishing Queensland economy post-COVID. The respective policies on reviving the conditions to encourage investment and jobs, cheaper energy and business-led recovery are yet to come. In this campaign for the right to lead Queensland into its first four-year term at one of its most critical post-World War II turning points, good policies will matter more than ever.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Striking right balance on rents	The Australian	Queensland’s ‘mum and dad’ landlords are feeling the pinch
The national cabinet has been an essential all-terrain vehicle for swift decisions during the pandemic. One of its misses, however, was in relation to residential rents. The national cabinet came up with a mandatory code for landlords and commercial tenants, with rents waived in part and deferred in part, in line with the loss of business income. Some retail tenants had simply refused to pay; landlords resorted to hardline tactics to enforce leases. For residential tenancies, however, the national cabinet opted for a temporary ban on evictions and a pause on rent increases for six months. “We won’t have anyone thrown out of their homes,” Scott Morrison said a fortnight ago, with the proviso people were still responsible for their rents. Rather than impose a national scheme, the Prime Minister said the nitty-gritty would be worked out by states and territories.
The governments of Victoria, NSW and Queensland have announced packages to protect tenants as well as land tax relief for landlords. But in Queensland property owners are upset over the Palaszczuk government’s lacklustre response. The government has promised a six-month eviction moratorium for tenants experiencing financial distress because of the pandemic. If landlords and distressed tenants can’t negotiate a short-term reduced rental arrangement themselves, there will be mandatory conciliation through the Rental Tenancies Authority. But tenants will not have to pay back the discounted rent at the end of the period and there has been no income-loss eligibility threshold set by the government, as there has been in other states.
The Real Estate Institute of Queensland is calling for a minimum income reduction threshold for tenants to meet before they qualify for the protection measures, such as the 25 per cent income reduction in NSW and 30 per cent in Victoria. The institute argues the Palaszczuk government should introduce a requirement for tenants to repay rental arrears after the crisis is over, and to enforce a 25 per cent income-loss hardship threshold. Most landlords are “mum and dad” savers, the quiet Australians who were targeted by Labor’s misguided assault on negative gearing at the federal election in May last year. The proposed changes are due to be passed by the state’s parliament on Wednesday.Although the government claims evidence of financial hardship would have to be provided in a dispute, as they stand the measures are tilted against owners. Landlords must be able to recoup unpaid rents when the crisis has passed. As well as protections, tenants must have obligations, as in other states. One is to demonstrate incapacity to pay. Another is eventually to make good the shortfall in rent. Landlords have bills to pay, mouths to feed, banks to satisfy. No one benefits if the rental market collapses, as the national cabinet has recognised. We hope this is merely a drafting oversight and that, before the legislation is presented, wiser heads prevail. COVID-19 is leading to some out-there policies, but this one will needlessly extend misery for those building up an asset base for retirement.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Good companies pay on time	The Australian	Quick action by government could boost economy by $7bn
According to Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell, late payments by large businesses to small businesses account for 53 per cent of all invoices. This means that $115bn worth of payments to small businesses are late and stops $7bn of working capital being available to small businesses every year. What an enormous waste. In a paper outlining early findings of a review into supply chain financing, Ms Carnell said “all businesses, regardless of their size should be paid in 30 days”. At a time when Canberra and Martin Place are trying to pump up consumer spending and business investment to fire up employment and GDP growth, this seems a modest, no-brainer method to get some stimulus into the economy.
As Robert Gottliebsen wrote on Saturday, this is a heads-up to the Morrison government in how to boost the economy by $7bn without spending a cent. Nor will it supercharge asset prices, especially housing, which the Reserve Bank is wary about in an ultra-easy money era. But Ms Carnell stopped short of calling for federal legislation for the 30-day requirement, which Alan Kohler concludes would be “an almost unprecedented government intervention in the market”. Apart from freeing up a huge amount of working capital for the main employers in the country (small businesses), Kohler argues on Tuesday the move “would protect small businesses from bullying by more powerful customers”.
Late payments, due to imbalances of market power, are a blight on our economy. Big companies routinely are stiffing small suppliers because they can. For instance, they’re deploying big data against them. “It is unreasonable for large businesses to use complicated and expensive AI systems to manipulate small businesses into reducing their margins,” Ms Carnell said. Supply chain financing is a useful tool; it helps to free up cashflow for businesses. The problem, of course, is the way some companies use it as a weapon when combined with extended payment times of 60 or 90 days.
Last month, after The Australian revealed the use of AI to squeeze its suppliers, Rio Tinto announced it was ditching its “dynamic discounting” scheme, one year after its launch. Telstra followed suit after Jared Lynch and Nick Evans revealed the telco spent more than a year plotting to unleash supply chain financing on its small and medium suppliers while extending their payment terms from 45 to 62 days. Telstra now has moved to 20-day terms for suppliers with invoices up to $2m annually. Rio Tinto now has 20-day terms for suppliers with turnovers of up to $10m. In a way, this only highlights the problem at hand. What if you fall just outside these parameters? Tough.
The Business Council of Australia has a “supplier payment code” that is voluntary and loose. Kohler argues the definition of small business is too tight and easily fudged, and not policed anyway. Is it under 20 employees (as the Australian Bureau of Statistics decrees) or a turnover below $10m (where some tax breaks apply), or both? “The supplier payment code is just an empty PR exercise, with BCA wanting to appear to be doing something about late payments but actually doing nothing of the sort,” he writes. Perhaps the competition regulator should investigate misuse of market power. The Australian Securities & Investments Commission also should consider regulating supply chain finance. We are not accustomed to advocating harsh laws for free enterprise but some businesses need to pull their heads in, do the right thing by suppliers and help the economy grow.ASIC’s latest figures on business failures show cashflow problems are responsible for about half of company collapses, with the figure on the rise in the past three years. Small and family businesses depend on smooth and predictable cashflows simply to carry on and grow. Some large companies should look at what the government is doing in this space with its own small suppliers. Last July it implemented 20-day payment terms for contracts under $1m, and five-day terms where both government and business were using e-invoices. Before the heavy hand of legislation hits them for six, in this instance companies should do what Canberra says — and does.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
We celebrate a nation and its achievement, not a date	The Australian	Reaching for unity does not entail conformity or dismissal of dissent Much of the date-wrangling debate falls away if Australia Day is welcomed as a celebration of our nation as a contemporary success, as an occasion for gratitude and goodwill, and a commonwealth project in which we look to the future with a spirit of hope, ambition and reconciliation. January 26, 1788, is a foundation date but the First Fleet is not the last word. And reaching for unity on a national day does not entail conformity of views or dismissal of dissenting voices.
As Noel Pearson has pointed out, we can trace three strands in our history — the deep Indigenous imprint, the settlers from the British Isles and the migrant mosaic, especially since World War II. Australia Day is an opportunity to reflect on how richly interwoven these threads can be, when we are at our best. It’s especially important to seek closer understanding at a time of polarisation, frayed trust in institutions and sharp conflict driven by social media and bad actors. This is not incompatible with honest reflection or acknowledgment of the truth that all national stories have dark or contested chapters.
Australia’s story was especially fraught because it involved an encounter between the leading edge of the industrial revolution and a traditional civilisation. This was a vast cultural gulf ripe for misunderstanding and miscalculation, and a complicating factor in addition to introduced diseases, Indigenous dispossession, frontier violence and fragmentation of a tribal way of life and worldview. It’s understandable if, from an Indigenous vantage, Australia Day seems to reduce to a date when the dreaming began to turn nightmarish. That same day also marks what for many decades was viewed as our shameful origin as a prison for the criminal and political outcasts of the British Isles; this was the convict stain. Yet recidivism and brutality in time gave way to enlightenment and aspiration, such that Australia emerged as a beacon of social mobility, prosperity and democracy. Indigenous disadvantage and injustice marred this achievement but did not nullify it, and Indigenous people will have a range of responses to Australia Day. Pride in Australia, and trust in its potential to do better, can coexist with a clear-eyed view of past wrongs.
Indigenous achievement and contribution are interwoven with the story of Australian success, just as the three narrative strands described by Mr Pearson have become richer and more interesting with intermarriage and intercultural exchange. Indigenous identity can be capacious enough to make room for a multiethnic sense of connection, just as post-war migrants may feel a patriotism more ardent than the complacent native-born, while seeing no contradiction at all in constantly reinvigorated ties with the culture and life of their home countries. This complexity is what it means to be human, and everybody loses if identity becomes narrowly politicised.
Much of the more intemperate campaigning against Australia Day appears to come from urban white elites and has more to do with a post-1960s New Left alienation than any particular Indigenous reality. This is an imported worldview that fails to come to grips with the fact that Indigenous society was never going to be left alone in its relative isolation.
It’s not discounting the culture shock and suffering that followed 1788 to point out that of all the expanding European empires, the British was often not the worst. The institutions its traditions made possible — rule of law, free speech, parliamentary democracy — have allowed plenty of room for robust criticism and analysis of the accompanying history of Indigenous dispossession.
Nation-building myths can be puffed-up exercises in self-congratulation but that’s not the understated Australian way. We also have to be careful not to go to the opposite extreme and indulge in repetitive and unproductive negativism. Australia is one of the very few countries in the world that remains a powerful magnet for would-be migrants, and their judgment has a good dose of realism in it.
This is not about telling Australians how they should mark their national day. That’s up to each person, of course. Some may not feel celebratory at all. But institutions and society at large ought to be confident enough to accentuate the positive on Australia Day. There is more than enough to celebrate, considering this country’s achievements and opportunities relative to other nations around the world today and in the past. And it is unwise, to say the least, for governments — even local councils — to parade the Invasion Day slogan because quite apart from its historical inaccuracy, it can be taken as an admission of a lack of legitimacy and authority. The vast majority of Australians are indifferent to this political theatre and symbolic anxiety. They are deeply patriotic, even if many feel disinclined to articulate what exactly that might mean. There is no grassroots push on any scale to change the date of Australia Day. This is probably based on the pragmatic view that giving in to activists would simply embolden them to up the rhetorical ante, and do nothing to improve poor Indigenous life outcomes. It was discouraging to see Australian activists last year seeking to co-opt the extreme politics of the BLM fringe in the US, which has a very different racial history. Identity politics and campus-derived “critical race theory” — which has captured some mainstream institutions — are counterproductive because unbalanced “anti-racist” invective only deepens social division and reinforces the category of race when we should aspire to get beyond it. There are traces of this overheated narrative in this year’s Australia Day diatribes. It’s profoundly counterproductive, and likely to make it more difficult to bring the mainstream along with necessary reforms, such as instituting an Indigenous Voice to parliament. There’s ample scope for good-faith debate about our history but we need to guide our ideas for improvement and reform towards a common future.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
COVID-19 debt mire set to bite	The Australian	Reducing payroll tax would stimulate employment growth Increasing numbers of Australians emerge from lockdown to return to their workplaces this week. They do so facing the daunting prospect that without economic reform, 20-year-olds will be pushing 40 by the time the federal budget returns to surplus and heading for 60 before the nation’s surging debt is repaid. The Morrison government’s COVID-19 emergency response has already sent federal government debt climbing to $430bn at the end of March, about $37bn higher than forecast before the pandemic. By the end of June, it will be billions of dollars higher again.
Economic policy, political culture and the structure of the federation are not among the abiding interests of most people born since 1980, much less those born in 2000 or later. But Generation Debt has a major stake in how political leaders, business and unions manage the economic transition out of the coronavirus crisis. Decision makers need to be clever and farsighted in adopting strategies that minimise the debt burden facing younger people and future generations, who might need to deal with challenges that are almost unimaginable now.
Tax policy needs attention. On Monday, PwC chief economist Jeremy Thorpe tells Adam Creighton the tax system “was not equipped to adequately support the growth required” as the nation makes its way back into the black. At the same time, PwC warned against any rush to reform, given the weak state of the economy as households and businesses deal with change on many fronts. In fostering job creation, Josh Frydenberg and his state counterparts have an excellent opportunity to minimise or abolish payroll tax through the newly reformed national cabinet system that will replace COAG. NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet has taken a lead in advocating that the states co-operate with Canberra to reform the system. Future budgets, federal and state, will need hard decisions on revenue raising. Government must also turn off the tap on largesse such as free childcare as soon as it is prudent. But growing the revenue base by growing the economic pie is the key to producing and earning our way out of debt. A competitive tax rate for large corporations, better tax breaks for investment, cost-efficient energy policy driven by pragmatism not ideology, better skills training, less onerous but smarter regulation and workplace relations that benefit employers, employees and encourage the hiring of more workers are vital. Scott Morrison has at least persuaded business and unions to “put down their weapons’’ to discuss moving past business as usual. But the hard part starts now. As they consider issues of “no disadvantage’’ and workers being “better off overall’’, they should remember that no one is better off if they cannot find work.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Seizing power of digital revolution for recovery	The Australian	Regulatory action will speed the innovation superhighway The evidence is in. The Big Tech revolution has enabled business to pivot online and limit losses during the pandemic. The results are on display at The Australian’s E-Commerce Summit this week, exploring how the digital revolution is transforming every aspect of daily life. Equally clear is the fact that regulators around the world are scrambling to catch up to ensure the benefits of the digital revolution are more widely shared. Done well, Australian Consumer & Competition Commission head Rod Sims says enacting consumer data rights to give individuals control over information collected about them will be a reform equal to the winding back of tariffs and the floating of the dollar.
Scott Morrison told the summit that COVID’s acceleration of e-commerce would be a cornerstone of the country’s recovery from the pandemic. A Deloitte report found that for goods-related businesses, e-commerce helped 61 per cent keep operating during the crisis by limiting revenue losses to 7 per cent — even though in-store revenues fell by 21 per cent. Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci says the chain is on track to have digital interactions with its customers at almost double the rate of customers walking into its stores in the next 18 months.
Alongside the positive news are warning shots that steps must be taken now to stop the major tech players from abusing their market dominance. The US Department of Justice has launched a long-anticipated antitrust action against Google that is a rerun of measures it took to break the market dominance of Microsoft in 1998. In a speech to the National Press Club, Australia’s top competition regulator, Mr Sims, outlined how Australia was engaged in the global effort to bring the tech giants to heel. The US government’s complaint against Google parent company Alphabet is that Google acted unlawfully to maintain its position in search and search advertising on the internet. The lawsuit says that ultimately, it is consumers and advertisers who suffer from less choice, less innovation and less competitive advertising prices.
The DoJ is asking the US courts to break Google’s grip on search distribution so competition and innovation can take hold. Google has called the lawsuit “deeply flawed”, claiming people use Google because they choose to, not because they are forced to or because they can’t find alternatives. Mr Sims called Google out on its defence. An ACCC Digital Platform report in July last year found that Google was paying Apple $US9bn ($12.7bn) a year to make Google the default web browser on its products. “I heard Google on the radio this morning saying that it doesn’t matter, we are just so popular people would be there anyway,” he said. “Well if that is the case why are you (Google) paying $US9bn a year to Apple.” In Australia, the ACCC is driving reform to force the big tech companies to reach agreement with media groups to pay for content. Mr Sims says the “take it or leave it” attitude of Big Tech when dealing with publishers has damaged journalism, which is “of course essential to a well-functioning society”. On media generally, he says the digital revolution has led to more competition, not less.
It is naive to believe, he says, that business will only and always act in the interest of customers. He cited economists Adam Smith, Joseph Schumpeter and Michael Porter as providing the foundation for his thinking. Smith identified the invisible hand of self-interest and competition, Schumpeter the theory of creative destruction and Porter put the view that the surest way to gain profits is to gain market power. The role of regulators is to prevent the natural instinct for self-interest to abuse creative destruction to gain unreasonable market power. Mr Sims says Facebook and Google achieved their dominant positions in search and social media through excellent and beneficial innovation. The issue is how much stronger they have become by acquiring other companies, stifling competition and further innovation. The DoJ has a long history of breaking monopolies for the good of consumers. As John Durie has written, the tech giants will ultimately be forced to reach a commercial agreement to open the market to others and changes will flow through to the rest of the world. Mr Sims has given a glimpse of the potential that will be unleashed when this happens. A taste of where that might lead is on display at The Australian’s E-Commerce Summit.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Learning harsh economic lessons during pandemic	The Australian	Reopening schools will limit long-term damage to students
Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan indulged an immense frustration on Sunday when he accused Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews of showing a “failure of leadership” by not having a plan to reopen schools in term two. Mr Tehan’s language may have been sharp, but it was not as severe as the damage he risked to the national consensus on restarting learning in the classroom. Scott Morrison quickly pulled his loose minister into line. Mr Tehan apologised for overstepping the mark. The next day, Mr Andrews said the comments were “ancient history”. Move along, please. Spats between consenting egos aside, Canberra has a point: children should be back at school. It’s essential for their progress and wellbeing. New studies show students living in poverty and those with a learning disability are most vulnerable in the shutdown. The danger is growing inequality, misery and lifelong damage.
Reopening schools is critical for the broader community, too. New Treasury analysis presented to national cabinet shows classroom closures have led to more than 300,000 job losses and ripped 3 per cent off our gross domestic product. The Prime Minister says those hard numbers put “enormous pressure” on the timetable to move us back to a COVID-safe economy. Getting kids to school frees up their parents, especially mothers. It will boost productivity and GDP. Although it does not run schools, Canberra is waving a $3.3bn carrot to non-government schools to reopen campuses and return to at least 50 per cent classroom teaching before the end of the month. Mr Morrison has been steadfast, rather than stubborn, on schools. Yet it is up to premiers and chief ministers, who take responsibility for schools, to make the tough calls.
Around the nation, authorities are reopening schools in a sequenced way. From Monday, NSW students will be back in the classroom, starting with a day or two of school-based tuition each week. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the flexible approach means authorities can respond quickly to new spikes in the spread of COVID-19. Queensland students will also be back on Monday, with prep, Year 1 and Years 11 and 12 to return first; if that goes well, all students would return to classrooms from May 25. In South Australia and Western Australia, students returned to class last week, although about a third continued to learn from home. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein urged parents to keep their children at home if they could. All Northern Territory schools are open.
But in Victoria and the ACT, there is no return date for government schools, although many private schools are back. In Victoria, parents have been told that all students who can learn from home must continue to do so. Those who cannot should attend their normal school. Still, there is some light at the end of the Zoom call: Mr Andrews is open to the idea of a return this term if the medical evidence supports the move. On this score, however, the advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee has not changed. On Wednesday, Mr Morrison noted that COVID-19 had a very low rate of transmission and movement between children, particularly when it came to severe cases. “Children can safely go to school, schools have always been safe to fully open,” he said. “You’ve got to make sure that workplace for those who work in it, for the teachers, others, is safe.” Of course that applies to any workplace as restrictions are eased. Nev Power’s COVID-19 Commission is working with employers and unions to develop tools for businesses to be able to open, keeping patrons and workers safe. Yet schools are different to, say, supermarkets or public transport. Teachers are exposed to kids in the confines of a classroom for extended periods; a classroom is an up close and personal environment; kids often don’t respect personal space. Protecting teachers from infection will require new protocols. In France, for instance, class sizes will be limited to 15; masks are obligatory for high school students; and teachers are encouraged to wear masks. School cleaning must be extended and improved. Older teachers, or those with health issues, should be rostered to minimise risks to them. The broader, faster, asymptomatic testing regime must be extended to all teachers, and possibly to their families.Federal, state and territory leaders have pledged to having a “sustainable COVID-19-safe economy by July”, subject to adequate testing, tracing and local surge health response capacity. On Friday, national cabinet is set to issue a three-step framework to remove baseline restrictions. That will give people a sense of what life will be like over the next few months. The longer school restrictions remain in place, the more it will hurt students; those in early childhood and elementary levels could be most affected, as well as the already disadvantaged. We know over the five weeks to April 18, almost one million jobs were lost; unemployment is rising fast. Each week of shutdown is costing us $4bn in lost productivity, workforce participation and consumption. Sadly, as Mr Morrison says, those are the facts. Our nation is being homeschooled in the harsh lessons of a pandemic.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Watershed week in US politics	The Australian	Republican senators in the US who joined Democrats in a rare New Year’s Day session of congress to reject Donald Trump’s efforts to veto bipartisan defence legislation delivered him a timely reality check. While Mr Trump persists with his uphill and almost certainly doomed battle to stay in the White House, Joe Biden’s victory is set to be formally certified by both Houses on Thursday AEST. The unprecedented 83-13 vote against the President showed how his influence is fading among Republicans.
Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate. In a telling departure from the deference normally shown to Mr Trump, in the vote on the $US741bn defence bill, just seven backed his attempt to scupper the legislation. They were joined in defeat by five Democrats and Senator Bernie Sanders, though for different reasons.
Mr Trump’s opposition was based largely on the mandate it gives the Pentagon to change the names of military installations commemorating Confederate leaders in the American Civil War. He also opposed the restriction it places on how much of the US military’s construction budget can be diverted into building his border wall with Mexico, and the President’s ability to draw down US troops in Afghanistan, South Korea and Germany. One of Mr Trump’s strongest supporters, Senator Tom Cotton, denounced the bill as “stiff-arming” the President. But that did not stop even the powerful Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, rejecting Mr Trump’s veto.
At any time, the Senate’s overwhelming rebuke of a president would be of major importance. Ahead of congress’ formal certification of Mr Biden’s victory and crucial run-off elections on Wednesday AEST in Georgia for two Senate seats that will decide which party controls the Senate, the vote was highly significant. A hard core of diehard Trump supporters in the House and Senate, taking their cue from his embittered refusal to accept that he lost the election and unmoved by the rejection by court after court of his claims of fraud, will try to use the certification process in a last-ditch effort to overturn Mr Biden’s victory. With Democrats holding a solid majority in the House, and Republican Senate leaders acknowledging Mr Biden won, the chances of them succeeding are remote. Even Vice-President Mike Pence has rejected attempts to inveigle him into the process. Mr Trump’s embittered response to his defeat is doing his legacy no good and could, polls suggest, help Democrats win the Georgia run-offs. That would be a major boost for Mr Biden.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Four fragile bubs were let down	The Australian	Restoring infants’ cardiac surgery in SA must be a priority Decent Australians recoiled at the tragic death of a tiny twin whose mother was unable to readily access Queensland from Ballina in NSW for medical treatment, under Queensland’s hard border closure in August. Forced to wait 16 hours for an emergency air transfer to Sydney, the unborn child died. Now David Penberthy has revealed the details of the deaths of four South Australian infants, unable to access appropriate medical treatment in Adelaide. This is a travesty. Adelaide is alone among the mainland state capitals in not having the capacity to provide dedicated ­paediatric cardiac surgery. The infants’ deaths have caused widespread consternation among specialist medical practitioners in the city’s medical community.
As Penberthy wrote on Wednesday, the paediatric cardiac surgery service was axed in 2003 by the then Labor government. The Marshall government, however, is justifiably under fire for failing to reinstate it. Nor can it plead ignorance. It was on notice to address this gaping hole in the state’s medical infrastructure and it took a conscious decision not to fund the restoration of such vital care. That wrong call has left four families devastated this year alone.
In a July 2019 submission, senior clinicians at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital presented a formal case to SA Health strongly urging the service’s reinstatement. That proposal was not confined to SA infants with heart problems, but also applied to babies in the Northern Territory who currently have to be flown to Melbourne. The submission listed “avoidable mortality” as the key reason for reintroducing cardiac surgery at the WCH. “SA and NT children and their families face multiple risks attributable to the current model of care,” it said. The submission fell on deaf ears, with the government citing unnamed senior clinicians who rejected it. Nor can Daniel Andrews be blamed for this tragedy. His borders remained open. Neither entry to Victoria nor treatment of the vulnerable infants was refused by his government or officials.
COVID-19 has stress-tested our social cohesion and medical systems. In particular, the alarming spread of the virus through aged-care facilities has led to the death of far too many older Australians. Every life is of value. Every human being possesses dignity. But there is something especially poignant about the deaths of newborn babies. Not only are their parents, siblings and extended families left bereft, but our nation is also much poorer. Could one have been another Bradman? Or another Cate Blanchett? Such speculation is not mawkish. Even if these little ones never made history, they deserved the best chance at full and fulfilling lives, contributing to their families and communities.
This nation has a superb health system. It is a source of pride and, in this challenging time, reassurance. But the absence of state-of-the-art cardiac treatment for infants in any Australian capital city is not good enough. Once seen as a miracle, such surgery is not uncommon these days. When governments rapidly expanded ICU and ventilator capacity in the face of the pandemic our nation took pride in not callously placing dollar values on life. Provision of the care required in SA is not overly expensive or complex. The shortcoming must be rectified now; a sad but important legacy of four much-loved babies who did not make it.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Blue Christmas as Covid threatens summer harvest	The Australian	Restrictions on workers, borders and trade will bite hard After years of drought and poor yields, farmers should be looking forward to bumper crops this season. The reality, however, is for more uncertainty, with doubts about how the bounty will make it from paddock to plate because of COVID-19 restrictions on workers, borders and trade. It is a problem that promises long-term consequences and is compounded as it flows through the supply chain from the farm to the supermarket shelf.
Warnings have been clearly signalled that border closures and other restrictions will affect the summer harvest. This has led some producers to restrict plantings for next year rather than waste money on crops that will have to be turned back into the soil. Restricted plantings mean today’s pandemic-inspired problems for agriculture will stretch further into the future than necessary.
Supermarkets have warned of food shortages for Christmas unless restrictions placed on warehouses are lifted soon. Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and independent supermarkets have told Victorian Jobs Minister Martin Pakula that supply chains that feed the state and the rest of the country will soon hit capacity constraints, making it impossible to catch up for the holiday rush. Retailers say restrictions on shift sizes at distribution points make it unlikely that supermarkets will meet the usual targets of having 15 per cent of their Christmas stock in stores by the end of September and 40 per cent by the end of October.
Coupled with the lack of capacity to harvest the nation’s food production, the outlook is that government-imposed conditions will make it harder to dig the economy out of recession. National Farmers Federation president Tony Mahar has cautioned that Australians face the prospect of higher food prices because of a shortage of workers. Primary producers traditionally have relied on backpackers, students and special visa workers from the Pacific Islands to harvest crops. Federal cabinet says it will consider incentives to get students and the unemployed into the regions to pick crops. This is welcome but may look better on paper than it will work in practice. Western Australia’s Work and Wander Out Yonder advertising campaign, which promotes the hard manual work of harvest as being an opportunity for city dwellers to take a welcome coastal retreat, underscores a disconnect that exists between the perception and reality of life in bush.
Crucial to keeping food producers in business and avoiding the threat of food price inflation down the track is open movement between states and a continued influx of workers from the Pacific Islands. The federal government has linked the two issues, with Agriculture Minister David Littleproud warning that farmers in Queensland, Tasmania and WA could miss out on foreign workers if their states do not sign up to the agriculture workers code. The code was adopted by other states and territories at the last national cabinet meeting and is designed to allow free movement across borders. Mr Littleproud says all Australians should be given the first chance to fill fruit- and vegetable-picking jobs. He says it will be challenging for the federal government to give states access to workers under the Pacific and seasonal workers program if they haven’t signed up to the code. Opening borders and lifting curfews and other restrictions must be a priority on all fronts.
Food writer John Lethlean has outlined the desperate future facing the once vibrant Melbourne restaurant scene. Lethlean says it is difficult to see how many will survive into next winter when the subsidies, presumably, are gone and the recession is biting harder. A similar fate is shared by thousands of small-business operators in the private sector, whether it be tourism, hospitality or other areas of service delivery that have been unable to trade because of government restrictions. Food harvest provides a useful illustration of the urgency to get things back on track. Once spoiled, produce that has been left on the tree or in the paddock to rot cannot be recovered. Food shortages for Christmas are a prospect too bleak to contemplate. The answer does not lie in continuing to stifle economic activity, which leads to higher prices or, goodness forbid, government-sanctioned war-era rationing. Allowing people to get back to work and to move freely between jobs around the nation is the only sensible option.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Budget steers a difficult course	The Australian	Reversing decades of overspending in Queensland will be a challenge
Cameron Dick came to his first budget on Tuesday with a few handicaps. First, like his federal and state counterparts, the Queensland Treasurer is working within fiscal parameters turned a deep shade of red as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Second, China’s aggressive trade war against Australia could potentially be devastating for Queensland’s coal exports. And third, the state’s debt problems already were deeply entrenched long before Mr Dick, a former barrister who completed part of his education at Cambridge, replaced Jackie Trad as Treasurer in May. Queensland lost its AAA credit rating on Labor’s watch in 2009. And in June last year, when COVID-19 was yet to appear, debt and spending were ballooning in Queensland to the extent that the first question in the budget lockup press conference was: “Have you given up on debt?” Last year, it went unanswered.
Judging by his efforts with this budget, Mr Dick is willing and able to tackle the issue. On Tuesday he admitted frankly that Queensland could be put on a “negative outlook” by ratings agencies. He will be heartened, then, by the news reported by Adam Creighton that S&P Global Ratings, after assessing the budget, says Queensland is “on a solid path to fiscal recovery” and has reaffirmed the state’s AA+ rating as “stable”. “For the first time in many years, Queensland’s debt levels will not be the highest in Australia,” it said in a statement.
In line with other states and the commonwealth, the price of COVID recovery in Queensland will be soaring borrowings, albeit at a bargain basement interest rate. Queensland’s total debt is forecast to reach a record $130bn by 2023-24 — a forecast hike of $28bn in three years. A $12.3bn collapse in revenue will be a major factor. In borrowing to rebuild, Mr Dick, like Josh Frydenberg, NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet and Victoria’s Tim Pallas, is following the Reserve Bank of Australia’s advice. “To do anything other than borrow to rebuild would condemn our economy to years of austerity and a far slower and more painful recovery,” Mr Dick said. He was at pains to point out that while NSW and Victoria will be carrying total debt levels exceeding 190 per cent of revenue by 2024, Queensland’s figure will be 174 per cent. The fact our largest states are in the same debt boat as Queensland has taken some of the political sting out of the issue for the Palaszczuk government. At the outset of its third term, Mr Dick has four years to lay the groundwork for a much-needed resurgence in private investment and job creation. He acknowledged as much in his speech, pointing to the need for regulatory reform to fast-track productivity gains.
Public sector wages growth has been a significant contributor to Queensland’s financial problems. During the five years of the Palaszczuk government, the public service has grown by 33,133 full-time equivalent employees — a 16.6 per cent rise while the state’s population has grown by only 8.2 per cent. At least the government seems prepared to slow down the runaway train. An additional 6168 full-time public service roles will be added this financial year, raising the employee expenses bill by 3.2 per cent. If achieved, this will compare favourably with an increase in employee expenses last financial year of 5.4 per cent. The relative reduction, as Sarah Elks and Charlie Peel report, is being driven by a wage freeze for public sector employees designed to offset the impact of COVID-19 measures.
One of its most important challenges is to encourage private sector growth. The budget addresses that issue up to a point, with a mix of temporary measures including payroll tax refunds, land tax and electricity bill relief for small businesses. Mr Dick should have taken payroll tax relief further for all businesses — it is a jobs killer, especially in hard times. Pruning it back should be a priority in future years. The infrastructure spending outlined is well targeted, especially upgrades to the busy Gold Coast-Brisbane M1 highway, parts of the Bruce Highway and extending Gold Coast light rail south to Burleigh Heads. While the pandemic has crippled international and domestic migration rates, Queensland, the federal Treasury predicts, will be the beneficiary of domestic migration, with 86,000 people from other states expected to move north in the next four years. The OECD has sharply upgraded its growth forecasts for Australia. And as the nation roars out of recession, Queensland is well placed to capitalise on the impetus for growth. Better late than never, its newly opened borders are already helping tourism. Mr Dick has delivered a carefully calibrated budget for the times.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Biden’s pitch for unity to end America’s ‘uncivil war’	The Australian	Revitalising the economy post-Covid will be one of his biggest tests Just 14 days after the US Capitol was ransacked by a rampaging mob, Americans have good reason to feel proud of the peaceful transfer of power in Washington that saw Joe Biden and Kamala Harris sworn in on the steps of the building. The dignity and gravitas of the inauguration showed the doomsayers how wrong they were when they misinterpreted the January 6 assault on the citadel of US democracy as a portent about the future of the nation’s institutions and its leadership of the free world. The ceremony underlined President Biden’s main message in his inaugural address, when he called on Americans to “end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal”. They must do so. And Donald Trump, however embittered about his defeat, should follow the example of previous presidents who, on leaving office, allowed their successors the clear air they needed after being sworn in. From his home in Florida, Mr Trump will further tarnish his legacy if he fails to behave in the national interest and tries to undermine the new administration. His “very generous” letter to Mr Biden, as the new President termed it, was a good sign.
With Ms Harris — the first woman to hold the vice-presidency — at his side, Mr Biden’s inaugural address, as Cameron Stewart reported, was “the speech most of America wanted to hear and the rest of America needed to hear”. It was, “pitch perfect” as “an antidote to the divisive rhetoric of the Trump era”. Its embracing tone was in stark contrast to the petulant style of Mr Trump’s departure from Joint Base Andrews on Air Force One, to the tune of Frank Sinatra’s My Way. It was all about him, to the end.
The second Catholic in history to hold the office of president after John F Kennedy, Mr Biden’s language was that of president and priest, as Paul Kelly writes. “He invoked Washington, Lincoln, Martin Luther King and Saint Augustine in defining the common elements of love shared by all Americans — opportunity, liberty, security, respect and truth.’’ His quoting Augustine prompted The Wall Street Journal to note that the new President is “refreshingly unwoke”. We hope he remains so.
Mr Biden made it clear it was his priority to heal the US: “My whole soul is in this, bringing America together.’’ He spoke of the turbulence besetting the country as it struggles with the toll of the pandemic; the battered economy in need of revival and the deepest racial divisions since the civil rights era. His overriding call for unity was aimed at both sides of the US’s fractious political landscape. Americans would do well to respond to his appeal to “stand in the other people’s shoes” and “lower the temperature” of their political discourse.
It is what is needed after the rancour stirred by Mr Trump’s false claims about election fraud, which have led a third of Americans to believe Mr Biden’s election win was illegitimate. But Mr Biden must make good on his pledge that he will govern for all Americans, including the 74 million who voted for Mr Trump, and that he will work for them no less than for the record 82 million who voted for him. Mr Trump left the White House under a dark cloud because of his graceless conduct and his unwillingness to accept defeat. But polls show the outgoing president retains the support of 90 per cent of Republican voters. Mr Biden cannot ignore that reality.
At 78 he is the oldest US president ever starting his first term. But after decades as a senator and vice-president, he brings vast legislative experience to the White House that few of his predecessors had. He must use his reputation as a leader willing to work across party lines to help heal the nation’s wounds and achieve the support needed for dealing with his major challenges, the COVID -19 pandemic and the economy.
He has got off to a rapid start. The first of a series of executive orders he signed after entering the White House fulfilled his promise to mandate mask-wearing in all government offices, something Mr Trump refused to do despite the pleas of the US medical fraternity. He has also honoured his promises to reverse Mr Trump’s decision to pull out of the World Health Organisation, flawed as it is, and announced that the US is returning to the Paris climate change accord. Despite Mr Trump’s withdrawal, the accord has continued to be supported by most US allies, including Australia. True to his word, Mr Biden has also terminated support for Mr Trump’s border wall with Mexico and lifted his ban on immigrants from countries with majority Muslim populations. Economic recovery and containing COVID-19, assisted by vaccines, will be major litmus tests.
While Australia’s alliance with the US remained strong under Mr Trump, Mr Biden’s pledge to “repair” America’s alliances and “engage in the world again” as “a strong and trusted partner” is a welcome message for all allies, including Australia, after Mr Trump’s isolationist, “America First” approach to foreign policy. After Mr Trump’s frequently abrasive relationship with some US allies, the challenge facing Mr Biden as the new leader of the free world is to rally a fractured West to join in a multilateral approach to confronting an increasingly aggressive China and a more menacing Russia in defence of a rules-based international order. But Mr Biden recognises, crucially, that America is at its most powerful when it works with and through allies. While more sophisticated in his approach than Mr Trump, Mr Biden is clear about the threat posed by China. He branded China’s treatment of its Uighur minority as “genocide’’ long before the Trump administration did just before it left office. At Senate hearings to consider Mr Biden’s nomination of Antony Blinken as Secretary of State, it emerged that the new administration will maintain Mr Trump’s strong support for Israel and retain the US embassy’s controversial relocation to Jerusalem. That is a good decision. Given the deep divisions in US society, Mr Biden must govern from the centre and resist the “progressive” domination sought by those on the woke left of the Democratic Party who were part of the coalition that helped win him office. To date, almost all his cabinet appointments, including Mr Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, are highly experienced pragmatists who recognise the policy limits needed to achieve the bipartisan support the administration needs. Mr Biden’s inaugural address showed he grasps the inflection point of history that he occupies. The test of his quest for unity will be in how he governs.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
The pitfalls of gesture politics	The Australian	Richard Di Natale leaves the Greens no closer to success
Richard Di Natale, who was talked up as the pragmatist to make the Greens a mainstream party, is escaping federal politics. His young sons and wife have more claim on him now than the party, which he leaves in tip-top form — or so he said on Monday when explaining his resignation as leader. In 2015, when this ambitious GP took over from Christine Milne, he irritated Labor by declaring the Greens to be “the natural home of progressive, mainstream Australian voters”. He reckoned his mob’s primary vote could be doubled to 20 per cent in a decade. On Monday he was still in hopeful mode: the major parties’ vote was doomed to keep declining and the Greens as a third force would rise to the opportunity of power-sharing.
Political reality may not be so obliging. Since the election in May last year, the primary vote of the Greens has ticked up, but some of this support may well return to Labor come the next federal poll and it’s distinctly possible that the Greens will settle back to their plateau level of around 10 per cent. Dr Di Natale inherited a party with 11 members and leaves with 10. Hope that last year’s election would boost the numbers came to nothing, and in 2018 a lot of Greens hype failed to deliver the Batman by-election in Melbourne.
Part of the story has been ugly internal conflict and complaints of a toxic culture, not only in Victoria but also a long history of futile intriguing by the hard-left NSW faction of Lee Rhiannon. The Greens’ grey eminence, Bob Brown, inspired environmental campaigns — over Tasmania’s Franklin River, for example — that galvanised support but were co-opted by the major parties. Across time this has had the perverse effect of making irrelevant paleo-left positions more influential within the Greens, hence the epithet “watermelons”. Ms Rhiannon has gone but obstacles to a constructive centrist role remain. Perhaps because of his idea of the Greens as a major party-in-waiting, Dr Di Natale too often struck a posture of self-righteous moral absolutism rather than seeking to engage and influence the party in power. (Gonski education funding was an exception where his divided party was to blame.) Refugee policy was a case in point; those who didn’t accept the Greens’ position were treated as hateful and to be denounced, not in error and to be persuaded.The risk for the Greens is that they become ever less patient with the messy but vital business of parliamentary compromise. In the new age of low-effort gestural politics — think GetUp — the Greens spend too much time making personal political attacks and too little crafting policy coalitions. These tendencies, damaging to a workable democratic system, are reinforced by the malign influence of social media. It creates an addictive mirage of vigorous activism but brings no real-world solutions and is deeply alienating to the sensible mainstream. The Greens are confronted with a dilemma. The workings of the party are opaque, at odds with their lofty rhetoric. But if the superficially appealing reform of more power to the membership were adopted, the likely result would be a further Corbynite alienation of the party from the difficult issues that really matter to ordinary voters.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Plunge in standards drives distrust in our universities	The Australian	Rigour and free expression must be lifeblood of education Australian National University vice-chancellor and astronomer Brian Schmidt, who is the only university leader in the world to win a Nobel prize (for physics), made a telling point in his annual Foundation Day address this week. Australia needs universities more than ever amid the COVID-19 crisis, he said. But they have possibly never been more distrusted. In an interview with Tim Dodd earlier this year, Professor Schmidt identified what families want universities to be. That is, a place where “Australian students can get an education as good as any place in the world but distinctively Australian”. That aspiration should serve as a model for our universities, which, since the days of the Colombo Plan in the 1950s, have attracted students from around the world for their quality and for the experience most students enjoy. For decades the sector built on that reputation to the point where last year education had grown into the nation’s fourth-largest export, worth $40bn to the economy. For now, at least, the coronavirus has smashed the business model centred on international students. But that is only one of a range of problems facing the sector, as serious revelations reported in recent weeks have shown. Most of these come down to the issue of standards, which university leaders must improve and defend if their institutions are to serve the nation and retain (or recover) their international reputations. Contentious cultural issues of academic freedom and censorship also loom large.
Suspicions that some institutions have “gone soft” in marking the work of foreign students have been rife for years. Alarm bells should be ringing among university leaders after confirmation that lecturers are being cowed into lowering academic standards by organised networks of overseas students. Academics admit they have “dumbed down” courses to ensure foreign students can complete degrees. Lecturers who refuse risk being targeted by official complaints signed by up to 100 students, as reported on Wednesday. It is even more alarming that such complaints are taken seriously by university executives and have the potential to derail academic careers. Language barriers are a major part of the problem, as local students know from experience. In defending standards, universities must insist on proficiency in English.
Recent scandals also show how far universities have strayed from what should be central to their raison d’etre — free speech and academic freedom. As Australian Catholic University vice-chancellor Greg Craven wrote recently, universities have two types of problems with freedom of academic expression. One is corporate, “where an academic writes something that could rile a major stakeholder: a sponsoring corporation, a government partner or — frankly — China”. Vice-chancellors understandably, but not heroically, Professor Craven noted, “feel for their institutional wallet”. The second assault on academic freedom is more insidious because it is internal. “An academic strikes trouble because he or she writes something counter to the accepted wisdom of their faculty or university as a whole.” Despite an admirable policy on free speech, the University of NSW resorted to censorship when it withdrew a tweet quoting adjunct law lecturer and Australian director of Human Rights Watch Elaine Pearson criticising China’s miserable human rights record in Hong Kong. UNSW vice-chancellor Ian Jacobs, to his credit, has apologised for the decision to delete the tweet.
The suspension of pro-Hong Kong democracy student activist Drew Pavlou by the University of Queensland also smacked of repressive censorship. Both universities’ approaches were anathema to Western ideals of free speech. But Chinese Communist Party propagandist media, unsurprisingly, were deeply critical of both Ms Pearson and Mr Pavlou. Such erosion of intellectual integrity has compromised universities’ credibility.
The treatment of James Cook University physicist Peter Ridd by his employers also was indicative of an increasing hostility to debate on campus. The cardinal sin that brought about Dr Ridd’s demise was his questioning of the rigour of university-linked research on the health of the Great Barrier Reef under climate change. Last year’s campus free speech report by former High Court chief justice Robert French made the point that university codes of conduct could be hostile to the freedoms they purported to uphold. That is particularly the case in relation to opinions that challenge progressive norms among academics. But when it suits them, some faculties prefer to turn a blind eye to empirical evidence. For instance, too many education faculties fail to prepare trainee teachers to use phonics in teaching children to read, despite impressive evidence about the method’s effectiveness compared with trendier “whole-word recognition” systems. Nor should promoting “cancel culture” be academics’ focus. Regardless of such problems, universities remain our prime drivers of ideas and scientific breakthroughs. As Professor Schmidt said, few people realise how large and direct a part the ANU and other universities are playing in the fight against coronavirus. During the enforced interruption in their operations because of the pandemic, vice-chancellors and other leaders have a chance to raise academic standards, reinforce the value of free speech and improve accountability to taxpayers and to the Australian students who primarily fund universities. Doing so would rebuild trust and enhance their international standing.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Big task striking balance on residents FROM THE EDITOR	Bay of Plenty Times	Roads were busy and many of our towns’ restaurants were booked out on the Coromandel last weekend again, the second weekend since Auckland’s move out of the lockdown.
Our current MP Scott Simpson noted the number of people in towns like Whangamata was noticeably lower during Auckland’s second lockdown.
Winter months are always quiet for local businesses but this winter has been exceptionally testing for many of our retailers in particular.
The year 2020 has highlighted just how important our relationship is with our bach-owning community.
The Coromandel has the highest percentage of non-resident ratepayers of anywhere in New Zealand, and this also brings its challenges.
Recently I interviewed south eastern ward councillor Terry Walker, who’s working alongside other councillors and Thames-Coromandel District Council staff on a spatial plan for Whangamata.
One of the goals is to create affordable housing and encourage more rental properties for our permanent population, including the service industry workers who, like volunteers, are essential to keeping a town functioning.
Encouraging a community that has a balance of more residents than non-residents is going to be a huge challenge for our council.
The experience of Queenstown, where a lack of international tourism due to this pandemic has created a severe economic downturn, shows the importance of a diverse economy where housing is affordable and rentals are available.
I know the Coromandel attracts brilliant minds.

Gabba decider promises thrills	The Australian	Roll on Friday’s toss. The best Test cricket series are those that come down to the final Test. After a win apiece and a draw in Sydney, where India fought intrepidly after all looked lost for the visitors on day four, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is up for grabs in Brisbane. Australia must win to claim it; India needs a win or a draw to retain it.
Without the Sydney to Hobart yacht race and the usual tennis tournaments, cricket, even with smaller crowds, has been the salvation of sports fans over summer. Both teams have had soaring highs, struggled in despair, and coped with injuries. The Test debuts of opener Will Pucovski, 22, and all-rounder Cameron Green, 21, added zest. So did the cracking batting of Steve Smith and Rishabh Pant in Sydney. Sledging happens when Test tensions run high. It shouldn’t, but it does. At least Australia skipper Tim Paine, who has led his side well since 2018, was big enough to apologise to Indian all-rounder Ravi Ashwin for his barbs on day five at the SCG. What is never acceptable, as Australian coach Justin Langer says, is racist abuse from crowds. It should not be tolerated. No touring side has won a Test on the Gabba’s hard, speedy wicket for 33 years. But this series has produced surprises and “incredible cricket, brilliant to watch on the field, really good spirits between both teams’’, as Langer says. In backing the home side, we look forward to a great tussle.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Rabbitohs failed in duty of care	The Australian	Rugby league’s future depends on the strength of its clubs
There is one word that sums up the National Rugby League’s inability to reform the code’s dreadful image as a hotbed of scandal and sin. That word is clubs. In clubland, players’ personal dramas — public misbehaviour, mental ill-health, drugs, allegations from women about mistreatment and domestic violence — are reputational risks, not serious welfare concerns.
Time and again, the top brass of the NRL says all the right things about being a force for good in communities. And time and again a disappointed public watches rugby league clubs cover up and try to “manage” episodes where players are caught engaging in serious misbehaviour. And it’s the clubs that seem incapable, or unwilling, to grasp that rugby league stars are in essence children’s entertainers — that if the game doesn’t attract families to purchase tickets, buy memberships, watch games on television and enrol their kids in junior comps, rugby league doesn’t have a future at all.
It was the NRL itself — not the clubs — that finally implemented a “no-fault stand down” policy for players charged with offences against women after a string of examples where clubs defied public expectations that men who were subject to a police charge or an apprehended violence order should not be allowed to run on to the field. And it’s the clubs that continue to allow men to go on playing even after allegations of domestic violence have been raised.
On Friday, The Australian reveals concerning evidence that the South Sydney Rabbitohs knew of allegations about star player (and now star development coach) Sam Burgess but did not act on them. There was no one bigger or more valuable to Souths than Burgess: the man who won them the 2014 grand final with a broken face; who brought his three brilliant brothers to the NRL; who dazzled kids and grown-ups alike with his snaggle-toothed smile and spectacular skill. But behind the scenes, the club knew of allegations that Burgess’s life was out of control: including claims of recreational and prescription drugs, women raising allegations about infidelity and inappropriate conduct, serious medical episodes and a deeply distressed wife asking for help.
Burgess, via his lawyers, has denied all the allegations. He is currently the subject of an intimidation (domestic violence) charge relating to his father-in-law, for whom police also obtained an apprehended violence order. Burgess is pleading not guilty and has strongly denied any wrongdoing. The NRL’s rules clearly state clubs are required to report any allegation of a registered player engaging in behaviour that could bring the code into disrepute to the governing body — the NRL. That way, its integrity unit can investigate. On Thursday night, Souths boss Blake Solly said he had referred one complaint — by a Melbourne woman — to the integrity unit. But the NRL strongly denied any referral was made. The focus of this investigation is not one man’s alleged misdeeds. It is South Sydney: a club that has failed in its duty to its player, his family and all those who believed in the Rabbitohs and rugby league.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Going home — and into the cold	The Australian	Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny knew the dangers he faced when he returned home to Moscow on Sunday, five months after being flown to Germany in a coma following his poisoning by Soviet-era military nerve agent novichok. The consequences of his immediate arrest — on what are widely regarded as trumped-up allegations that he and the European Court of Human Rights say are “political prosecutions” — have yet to emerge. What is clear is that Mr Navalny’s treatment shows yet again the brutal oppression meted out to its democratic opponents by Vladimir Putin’s ruthless regime. The incoming Biden administration was right to be quick off the mark, with national security adviser designate Jake Sullivan saying: “The Kremlin’s attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard.” He was joined by other Western nations — including Germany, whose Chancellor, Angela Merkel, provided refuge for Mr Navalny — but more needs to be done by the global community to leave Mr Putin in no doubt that mistreatment of democratic activists such as Mr Navalny puts his regime beyond the pale of the international community. Mr Biden must put a definitive end to Donald Trump’s perplexing attempts to bring his “friend” Mr Putin back into major international groupings like the G7, from which Russia was barred following its unlawful 2014 invasion of Crimea. Mr Navalny’s imprisonment shows how wrong Mr Trump was when in May last year he put Russia’s proposed return to G7 membership in the context of also bringing in democratic nations, including Australia. As president, Mr Biden must not make the same mistake.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Biden is right to call out a tyrant	The Australian	Russia’s Vladimir Putin remains a threat to Western democracies
It is no surprise that Joe Biden’s branding of Vladimir Putin as “a killer with no soul” has provoked ire in the Kremlin. But the US President had good reason to make it clear that his view of the Russian despot is substantially different to that of Donald Trump, who, inexplicably, never missed an opportunity to praise Mr Putin and expound on their friendship.
Once again, as in 2016, Russia stands accused in a major report by the US intelligence community of trying to interfere in an American election. The report claims Moscow sought to influence last November’s presidential race in favour of Mr Trump by “denigrating” Mr Biden and his family over alleged business dealings in Ukraine by his son, Hunter.
The report by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines was sent to Mr Trump before he left office in January and declassified on Wednesday. Asked about it in an interview, Mr Biden pledged that Mr Putin would “pay a price” for the Russian interference. He agreed when asked whether he thought Mr Putin, a former KGB colonel, was a “killer”. He also confirmed that in 2014, as vice-president, he told Mr Putin in a meeting that “I don’t think you have a soul”.
Such plain speaking from world leaders is rare. Mr Biden deserves praise for calling out the Russian ruler’s repeated acts of brazen subversion, not just in the US but across the world. As Simon Benson and Geoff Chambers reported on Thursday, ASIO’s announcement that it had cracked “a major foreign espionage network operating in Australia” did not involve China; rather, “speculation in the intelligence community centred on Russia, which has traditionally regarded Australia as a backdoor to US intelligence”.
With his vast foreign policy experience, Mr Biden appears determined to confront Mr Putin in the way Mr Trump was unwilling to do. Doing so is in the interests of the Western alliance. The former president’s invariably gushing praise for the Russian leader was always misplaced and perplexing at a time when Mr Putin’s opponents were suffering unexplained deaths and he was using the deadly Soviet-era agent, Novichok, to launch an attack against adversaries in Britain.
Even in his final months in office, Mr Trump could see no wrong in his “friend Vladimir”. He tried to get him back into the G7, from which Russia was suspended following its outrageous 2014 invasion of Crimea, using an invitation to Scott Morrison to attend the 2020 summit as cover to bring in his friend. Angela Merkel and other G7 leaders soon saw through the ploy. Strong and consistent Western leadership is essential in dealing with tyrants. Mr Biden’s clear-eyed assessment of the threat posed by the Russian despot deserves support.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Leave the politics aside, get serious about fixing things	The Australian	Safeguarding of young ministerial staff calls for bipartisanship By Monday, former ministerial staff member Brittany Higgins had been joined by three other women in making allegations against a former male colleague; three of sexual assault and one of sexual harassment. Ms Higgins has decided to take a formal complaint to the police about the alleged rape in March 2019. There is also a slew of official inquiries, notably into the workplace culture in our political capital and the question of who in the Prime Minister’s office knew what and when.
Much media coverage frames this as a political scandal, and in some ways it is inescapably political. The alleged rape of Ms Higgins took place in the office of the defence industry minister at the time, Linda Reynolds, and complainant and accused were political operatives. The way in which this was handled when Senator Reynolds was informed — and how the aftermath is dealt with now — may well have political implications. But the paramount concern should be for Ms Higgins and the other complainants as individuals entitled to every consideration and justice according to law, while the accused has a right to due process.
At the same time there are public interest questions. Might the alleged incident in 2020 involving a separate Liberal staff member have been preventable had there been different decisions in the case of Ms Higgins? Might other similar complaints not have arisen if there had been different rules, procedures and norms in the parliamentary workplace and influencing social life, especially in relation to safeguarding of young female ministerial staff? It’s totally legitimate for parliament and the media to scrutinise the structure and independence of the reviews initiated by Scott Morrison to maximise the likelihood that they will achieve the right results.
But these causes — of justice for individuals, of a parliamentary workplace that is truly collegial and respectful — are only set back by reckless politicisation of these allegations. Opposition Senate leader Penny Wong’s glibly crafted line that Mr Morrison has approached a rape claim as a “political problem”, not a criminal matter, is rather rich in light of the overheated courtroom rhetoric with which she probes the political process in the hope of implicating the Prime Minister’s office. On Monday in the Senate she gave her spiel an added partisan edge by name-checking November’s politically selective ABC Four Corners program, Inside the Canberra Bubble. Throwing stones in glass houses?
Nor did Senator Wong do the complainants any favours by using their stories to gee up a flighty political generalisation, asserting: “We know that at best Mr Morrison runs a government where the culture is ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ when it comes to serious criminal allegations. And at worst Mr Morrison himself is part of the cover-up.” In Guardian Australia on Monday, Labor frontbencher Clare O’Neil indulged in a lazy, hashtag-level rant, telling readers “male entitlement” was so entrenched in parliament that men “strut the hallways, loll on couches, talk loudly and laugh raucously at the cafe, and take up more space in every part of the building”. This trivialises serious, potentially criminal, matters and is not the way to enlist most decent men in helping to address a problem of behaviour, standards and example.
The opposition quickly seized on the time-honoured cliches of a political cover-up, protesting it “beggars belief” the Prime Minister didn’t know of the Higgins allegations earlier, that the government must “come clean”, and so on. It’s certainly worth going back and reflecting on how the Reynolds office responded to Ms Higgins in distress, whether her allegations became more widely known within the government, and what decisions might have been made but were not. Let the chips fall where they may.
But the transparently partisan politics of the opposition and the social media outrage this feeds on are a monumental distraction. Official reviews into workplace culture should be sharply focused on what specific, practical changes are likely to make a difference, not a vague and rambling exercise in diversity consultant platitudes. The problem is difficult and demands a pragmatic and realistic approach. Junior ministerial staff and volunteers, especially young women, are potentially vulnerable. Some arrive as bedazzled idealists and get drawn into a pressured, artificially intimate work environment that blurs into alcohol-fuelled socialising. This may place older, more senior male staff in a position where the vast majority will be naturally protective but some will abuse this trust to turn predator. Alcohol can cloud issues of consent and memory, pressing a complaint of sexual assault is never easy, and an ambitious young political staff member may well fear being seen as a liability in a world where upside and winning are everything. There must be sensible ways to reduce the risks, but the best way to find them is to get past the big emotive gestures and start to dig into the detail of workplace rules, procedures and norms. Ms Higgins put it well in her statement on Friday: “How ministerial and parliamentary staff are treated is a bipartisan issue that impacts staff from across the political spectrum and must be treated as such.”	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Taliban’s posturing is absurd	The Australian	Sanctimonious response to alleged war crimes is irrelevant Given its appalling record of human rights abuses and savagery for many years, the Taliban’s sanctimonious finger pointing at Australia over alleged war crimes is irrelevant. Claims on the Taliban’s “Voice of Jihad” website that the Brereton inquiry’s findings are “only a small sample size of the greater indelible evil and criminal activity — a tip in the mountain of crimes committed” is patently false. So is the Taliban’s absurd efforts to label Australia “a savage, degenerate invader protected from all accountability”. The Afghan government has defended Australia’s legacy in Afghanistan as “overwhelmingly positive”, as Amanda Hodge reports.
Barbaric terrorist outfits have no claim to any moral high ground, even if they are about to do a “peace” deal brokered by the outgoing Trump administration. The rantings of insurgent thugs who have never come close to following the Geneva Conventions on war do, however, underline the importance of Scott Morrison’s insistence that “we deal with this matter under our justice system, our rules, our laws in a proper process with the presumption of innocence, obviously”.
Striking the right note, on Saturday the Prime Minister said: “We need to ensure the seriousness of the contents of this report are dealt with under the Australian justice system by Australians in accordance with our laws. That is why we are moving quickly to set up the Office of the Special Investigator and ensure that this is put in place and can take carriage of those issues forward.” The inquiry, led by Major General Paul Brereton, has recommended the investigation of 19 defence personnel over 39 unlawful killings of innocent Afghans.
Defence Force chief General Angus Campbell was also reassuring on Sunday when he pledged again that all aspects of the report’s findings would be fully considered and acted upon. He acknowledged that the special forces in Afghanistan may have been given too much responsibility. While some Afghan operations could only have been undertaken by SAS troops, other parts of the army could have played a bigger role, he said.
Earlier this year, the UN reported more than 100,000 civilians had been killed or injured in Afghanistan in the previous 10 years. All were victims of a brutal war caused by the Taliban’s relentless insurgency in the name of jihad. In an earlier report, the UN condemned the insurgents for “systematic massacres against civilians”. Under their ruthless oppression, Taliban commanders running human trafficking networks have sold women into sex slavery, forbidden women from being educated, and launched attacks against Christian aid workers, some of whom were working to vaccinate against polio.
The Taliban has denied involvement in last week’s rocket attack on Kabul, which caused eight deaths. Such atrocities, these days, are also being perpetrated by the growing Islamic State presence in the country.
The Taliban’s attempts to make capital out of the Brereton report should also be seen in the context of the terrorists’ efforts to secure release of one of their own who killed three Australian soldiers in cold blood. Hekmatullah was ostensibly a soldier in the Afghan army. In August 2012 he ambushed the Australians — Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic, Sapper James Martin and Private Robert Poate — in a so-called “green on blue” attack as they relaxed playing cards at their base in Tarin Kowt.
He was sentenced to jail by an Afghan court. But he was a hero to the Taliban, which has made his freedom a condition of the peace deal being brokered by the Trump administration to get US troops out of Afghanistan. No action better sums up the Taliban’s contempt for human rights and justice. The Trump administration has ignored Australian pleas to ensure Hekmatullah is not released. As both Mr Morrison and General Campbell have emphasised, the vast majority of the 27,000 Australians who have served in Afghanistan did so with integrity and professionalism. They have done much to liberate the country from the Taliban and establish a degree of stability. As Mr Morrison says, those who served should “in no way feel reflected upon by the actions alleged of a number, a small number’’.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Iran’s voters go cold on regime	The Australian	Sanctions are biting hard and Tehran’s lies are backfiring
After days blatantly lying about last month’s shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger airliner over Tehran, Iran’s ayatollahs want the world to believe coronavirus was to blame for the lowest voter turnout in an election since the 1979 revolution overthrew the Shah. They’re kidding no one, even though their anxiety to finagle the truth is no surprise. In the weekend vote for a new, 290-member Majlis (parliament), according to government figures (viewed with considerable suspicion for gilding the lily), there was a turnout of 42 per cent of the 58 million eligible voters under a non-compulsory system. That compares with 64 per cent in 2014 and 62 per cent in 2016. The previous lowest turnout was 51 per cent in 2004.
The outcome in Tehran, a hotbed of anti-regime sentiment, was even worse with an abysmal 25 per cent casting ballots despite repeated exhortations from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei for voters to exercise their “religious and patriotic duty”, and polling stations staying open late. Ayatollah Khamenei and other officials issued defensive statements blaming everything from alleged Western propaganda about coronavirus which, they claimed, scared voters away, to bad weather. The truth is that after months of seriously deepening economic hardship due to Donald Trump’s reimposition of crippling sanctions, and undiminished anger over the regime’s lies about the “own goal” shooting down of the Ukrainian aircraft, in which 82 mostly young Iranians died, voters set out to embarrass the regime by staying away. Their rage is understandable: the World Bank estimates sanctions shrunk the Iranian economy by 9 per cent last year. Inflation and unemployment have soared. Iranians are hurting. Hundreds of street protesters were killed by regime forces last November when nationwide demonstrations about their plight were ruthlessly suppressed.
Yet the regime remains defiant. It has refused Mr Trump’s repeated offers of dialogue about a revised nuclear deal that could lead to sanctions relief. Instead, it has continued its brazen terrorist activities across the Middle East aimed at the ultimate destruction of Israel. Protesters’ demands that the regime use billions of dollars Barack Obama made available to Tehran when the nuclear deal was signed (Mr Trump claims it was $US150bn) to help the economy have been ignored. To the fury of the embattled protesters, it has gone into Iranian military involvement in Syria and Yemen and supporting terrorist groups such as Hezbollah.After 6850 of almost 14,000 would-be candidates (many reform-minded) were arbitrarily debarred by the unelected Ayatollah Khamenei’s Guardian Council, it is no surprise hand-picked, hardline regime loyalists won the election in a landslide. Many are said to be extremists in the mould of fanatical former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was hellbent on the destruction of Israel. “Reformists” ended up with a paltry 17 seats. They got not one of the 30 in Tehran, a centre of dissent. In Iran’s authoritarian system, parliament’s powers are limited. But as an indication of the deepening disaffection of Iranians for their oppressive rulers, the election could hardly have been more significant. The message writ large is that Iranians are increasingly fed up with the profound economic hardship being caused by sanctions and the obdurate regime’s refusal to change. The ayatollahs would be unwise to ignore the anger of the millions who stayed away.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Every day at school a good day	The Australian	Savvy parents are gearing up for children to learn at home
The situation may change any day. As of Thursday, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy and health officials advising governments believe that keeping schools open is the best option to protect the community amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The situation is being monitored day by day. Reports of coronavirus transmission in schools remain low, but the concerns of parents, teachers and principals about the risk of infection are understandable. At this stage, as Scott Morrison warned on Wednesday, the consequences of closing schools would be severe. Forcing parents to stay home with younger children would deplete the medical workforce. Closures would exacerbate unemployment among school support staff. There is also the issue of youngsters visiting and being cared for by grandparents, potentially infecting them. Families can only make up their own minds, with many older Australians preferring to face the risks, albeit with hygiene precautions, than pine in loneliness, which also undermines immune systems. The Easter school holidays, starting on March 28 in Victoria and a week or two later in other states, will be a dry run for what to expect in the event of longer-term closures. Like the Prime Minister, who says children should only be away from school if they are unwell, many Australians are keeping a sensible perspective. Of respondents to a poll on The Australian’s Facebook page, 55 per cent supported schools remaining open.
At school, life has changed. Large assemblies and excursions are out, lunch breaks have been staggered and there is a strong emphasis on hygiene. For as long as medical experts judge it prudent, every day that schools remain open is a good day. That is especially the case for disadvantaged children and those whose home lives are not conducive to learning away from classrooms and the support of teachers and school resources, especially books. School closures, if they eventuate, will be an enormous wrench for many students, especially when activities, such as movie-going, sport and teenagers’ part-time jobs will be limited. For students with problematic, even abusive, family backgrounds, prolonged school closures would be traumatic. Senior staff and officials in state education departments and the Catholic and independent sector should be laying the groundwork for supporting the most vulnerable students. In Britain, where schools close on Friday, provision is being made for the children of key workers and vulnerable children to be minded at school. That option is worth exploring. Schools must also pave the way, of course, for students to learn as much as possible independently, through school intranets, online interaction, reading lists and text books. Many of the expensive independent schools that have already closed, contrary to government and public health advice, are well equipped for online learning. It is especially important that state education authorities are proactive to ensure students from disadvantaged schools are not left to waste large chunks of lengthy downtime on computer games. As always, parental responsibility will be paramount.
It is reasonable to suspect that 2020 could be a write-off in terms of major exams and university entrance. Much would depend on how long school closures would be deemed necessary. Mr Morrison took Australians into his confidence, noting that any measures put in place could remain for six months or longer. In announcing its school closures, Britain scrapped this year’s major public exams, which are held mid-year, before the northern hemisphere summer. Australia can only judge on local circumstances. This year’s transition to a new system of Year 12 assessment and university entrance in Queensland, for example, will be a consideration.Teachers, unions and some principals are outspoken about what they see as the health risks of leaving schools open, as Rebecca Urban wrote on Thursday. They are entitled to speak up. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, which ­includes chief health officers from the states and territories, however, is best placed to judge. Its current advice, that schools stay open, today, is worth following.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
COMMENT Pain of uniform rort bites parents	Wanganui Chronicle	School’s back this week for most ... and many parents will be exhaling a sigh of relief after a long break.
I don’t mind the holidays, I like having the kids at home and not having that morning rush for breakfast, uniforms, bags, packed lunches it’s nice for them to sleep in and for parents to get a break from the daily grind of extra curriculars, homework supervision, etc.
But it’s tough when we’re back at work and they’re still at home. It makes the struggle to juggle more complex.
Parents are less relaxed and more stressed, kids are getting bored, even they want to get back to routine and their mates.
But the costs at this time of year are huge. I was not surprised to read over the weekend that many parents are irate at uniform costs.
I’m glad parents are speaking up about it. The costs are excessive, and it doesn’t seem to matter what decile school you go to, the costs are too high.
And of course it comes at a terrible time of year budget-wise for many, right on the back of Christmas — it’s tough.
The advice I read was that parents should agitate their boards of trustees about uniform costs, and I hope more parents do.
In a recent survey, 50 per cent of parents said they felt worried or overwhelmed about organising kids for back to school.
Because it’s not just uniforms is it? It’s also books, stationery, calculators, sports gear, the extra curricular stuff. It all adds up.
Sixty-four per cent of parents said they’d made sacrifices to be able to afford school uniform items. Fifty-nine per cent said their kids would have to wear their old uniform for another year.
I don’t know why schools don’t offer more variety in suppliers to purchase uniforms.
It seems a rort that uniform shops can dictate their own prices because it’s literally the only place you can buy it.
That exclusivity means no competition which means higher prices.
Often the quality is questionable. I know one of the schools our kids attended had a run of bad shirts with buttons endlessly popping off and it wasn’t until enough parents complained that they did something about it.
But also the second hand market — I can see why uniforms are so hard to get second hand. It’s lack of availability. And you can see why. If the prices for new ones are so excessive, parents are keeping their kids in older uniforms for longer.
I don’t have much confidence the Education Ministry is looking to do anything about it any time soon either. It says it’s “investigating.. but not looking to subsidise uniform costs“.
So the only solution for parents it would seem, is to keep up the pressure on school boards of trustees to do something about it.

Staying on political course while managing the crises	The Australian	Scott Morrison promises to keep Australia safe and strong
In a quieter age, Paul Keating mused the summer break was a chance for Australians to get back in touch with the country. “Mercifully free from work and politics, we have time to reflect,” he said 26 years ago on our national day. For some, that down time has led to the conclusion that the world has changed. This summer has provided no respite from politics or tragedy, as drought, bushfires and the spread of coronavirus have quickened the news tempo. Scott Morrison, too, has been on deck for weeks, dealing with natural disasters and the messy sports rorts affair. He has lost some political skin. At the National Press Club on Wednesday, the Prime Minister’s task was to reset the story for the coming year in Canberra, with hopeful messages for voters and rhetorical pushback to reporter-critics of the Coalition’s approach to climate change. All up, Mr Morrison remained constant to the themes that won the election last May, pitching directly to mainstream voters. He’s not changing course; the man is not for turning.
After the tumult of the Rudd-Gillard and Abbott-Turnbull years, the Prime Minister is trying to build a narrative of security, strength and resilience. One of the keys to his win was a narrow but deliverable agenda. Mr Morrison did not unduly raise expectations or promise bold reforms. Nor did he offer disruption to our way of life. Bill Shorten had vowed to remake the economy and society. To our mind, Mr Morrison’s limited policy ambition was a pity, given the challenges we face. But considering the dysfunction in politics of the past decade, internal dynamics in the Coalition and the dodgem-car ride through the Senate for any sensible reform, there is some justification. Political trust is in free fall. To operate with success in this climate, it’s prudent to rein in promises and spare people surprises — think new taxes, big cuts to programs or one-off levies.
Mr Morrison stressed that a growing economy underpinned a sound fiscal position, allowing the government to pay for services such as aged care, disability insurance scheme, health and education. A balanced budget means Canberra can quickly respond to emergencies such as the bushfires and recovery operations. A sustainable budget, he said, meant the nation could invest in climate change adaptation and resilience. In an analogy aimed at the people who decide elections in this country — not the ageing keyboard worriers and fresh-faced insta-pundits of the press gallery clamouring for higher emissions targets and the end of coal — Mr Morrison said he was “taking out insurance for the climate in which we are living in”. He argued it was akin to defence spending, “a wise investment because it keeps Australia’s strategic interests safe and secure”.
So Mr Morrison is holding his ground on climate policy, amid a local and international media campaign that is fanning a crisis narrative. The Prime Minister picked apart the flaws in the Paris Agreement; we can do only so much. He argues developing nations, such as China and India, can continue to increase emissions while Australia is held to higher standards. He noted workers were worried about their jobs being exported overseas for little environmental benefit. A solution had to be global in scope; the rest was noise.
Mr Morrison insists the way forward is to “meet and beat” our international obligations, invest in new technology and use gas as a transition fuel. He lauded the building of new capacity in renewables and rejected out of hand claims the nation had been fudging the numbers on emissions reduction. This is the sensible centre of policy, where most Australians live. This is not climate denialism. In the government’s judgment, this strategy will carry the day. Yet the challenge is to deliver an energy policy business can bank on and invest in. Climate and energy policy are joined at the hip, inform each other, often fight each other. But they are not the same thing. The sweet spot for lower emissions at least cost, reduced prices for business and consumers, and power reliability remains elusive.
At a broader level, Mr Morrison’s instinct is to not panic. After all, the economic foundations are solid. In the face of Brexit, market volatility, US-China trade war, coronavirus and weak growth, the Coalition is holding its nerve on fresh stimulus measures. Tax relief, interest-rate cuts and expedited infrastructure spending are washing through the economy; but consumers are wary and investment is in a hole. At sub-2 per cent GDP growth the economy is drifting and underdone. Josh Frydenberg’s task is more than talk therapy, although that has its place.The coming budget is likely to stay the course: fiscal balance, tax cuts, regulatory moves, skills programs and big capital works. A tax break for new investment is expected, but it’s unlikely there will be game-changing reforms. Again, we fear a missed opportunity for raising our GDP speed limit. What worked last year may not be right for this year. We wonder what the Prime Minister’s plan B will be if our export markets tank, property markets stall, commodity prices dive and the jobless rate begins to tick up. Right now, Mr Morrison is betting the temper of the times and voter tolerance demand his safe, steady and incremental approach.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Protecting consumers online	The Australian	Scrutiny must keep pace with progress in digital technology
After last year’s completion of the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission inquiry into digital platforms, it makes sense that Josh Frydenberg has now asked the ACCC to dig deeper.
On Saturday, we reported that Facebook, Google, Apple and other digital giants will be forced to explain how they use the data of consumers for highly personalised, targeted advertising. The competition watchdog will report on the matter by August next year, with an interim report by the end of this year.
In its report into digital platforms in June last year, the ACCC posed pertinent questions about the tech giants’ collection of user data, which is central to their opaque business model. “Do consumers make informed choices in relation to how their user data is collected and used by digital platforms?’’ the report asked. “Can the collected data be used in ways that harm society?” Consumer privacy was a major concern, the ACCC found. Few Australians would disagree with the report’s recommendation that reforms were needed to ensure consumers were “adequately informed, empowered and protected, as to how their data is being used and collected”. Transparency and protection, the ACCC said, would increase trust in the digital economy and spur competition between businesses on the basis of privacy.The Treasurer also has directed the ACCC to shine a light on how internet information is shared with advertisers, and whether internet ads are providing value for money for businesses. That inquiry is a response to the ACCC’s warning in last year’s report that the tech giants were distorting the ability of businesses to compete on their merits in ­advertising, media and a range of other markets.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Guard national sovereignty from foreign interference	The Australian	Security agencies must pursue such investigations hard In light of warnings by security agencies of “unprecedented’’ foreign interference in Australia, ASIO’s investigation into NSW upper house Labor MP Shaoquett Moselmane and his part-time staffer, businessman John Zhang, is vital to national security. The offices of both men have been raided in the past few days. Neither has been charged with any offence — the matters are being considered. But even former Labor senator Sam Dastyari — who quit federal politics in 2017 after revelations about his own links to Chinese Communist Party-aligned interests in Australia — acknowledges the seriousness of the issue. The investigation comes hard on the heels of revelations of increasing cyber attacks on government and business in Australia from a foreign player. It is a test of espionage and foreign interference laws passed by the Turnbull government in late 2017.
Security experts believe the ASIO raids were driven by deep concerns Mr Moselmane could be “taking instructions” as a “tasked individual” of the Chinese Communist Party, acting in hostile opposition to Australia’s interests. NSW voters are entitled to question Mr Moselmane’s values and loyalties. In June 2018 the MP claimed the only way for China to reach its potential was for it “to force a change to the rules and create a new world order’’. In March this year, his bizarre fawning over “phenomenal’’ and “breathtaking’’ efforts of Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Chinese people to combat COVID-19 defied logic and reason.
The Labor Party had no alternative but to suspend Mr Moselmane on Friday. On August 4, when the NSW parliament resumes, the party will move to suspend him from his position in the state’s upper house. It was the least it could do: the NSW government does not have the numbers in the upper house to suspend Mr Moselmane without Labor or crossbench support. In an incredible new twist, Rachel Baxendale reports on Monday that Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews’s staffer, Nancy Yang, completed CCP propaganda training in 2007 at the same Chinese institution where Mr Zhang trained in 2013. Both staffers have links to China’s United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, the CCP’s overseas influence and interference arm. Earlier this month, Baxendale reported that in March this year, Ms Yang, who had worked as a visa officer for the Chinese consulate in Melbourne, posted an article on her Facebook page about COVID-19 under the heading “Chinese official suggests US Army to blame for outbreak”. Mr Andrews, whose government is a signatory to China’s controversial Belt and Road Initiative, cannot insult Australians’ intelligence by dismissing such connections as “conspiracy theories’’. All sides of politics, and other organisations with close ties to China, such as universities, should be careful of China extending its largesse. The warnings are clear. In November last year, ASIO’s Director-General of Security, Mike Burgess, issued a statement noting that hostile foreign intelligence activity “continues to pose a real threat to our nation and its security’’. ASIO, Mr Burgess said, would “continue to confront and counter foreign interference and espionage in Australia’’. Politicians and staffers have been warned. Protecting national sovereignty is paramount.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Public on Premier’s side but big questions remain	The Australian	Self-serving MPs like Mr Maguire give politics a bad name Standards of propriety matter in public life. And although Daryl Maguire, the former Liberal member for Wagga Wagga in the NSW parliament, has not yet concluded his evidence to the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption, it is clear he egregiously abused his position, failed his constituents and pursued personal gain over the public good for many years. On his own admission, Mr Maguire treated his electoral and Parliament House offices as private business premises from which he peddled influence and solicited cash from an odious cluster of grifters and opportunists. He brazenly conducted a lobbying business, G8way, to arrange access to the highest levels of the NSW government. He presided over a cash-for-visa scheme that was essentially a scam. That little earner entailed the physical delivery of bags of cash to his Parliament House office in return for his arranging visas for Chinese nationals. It defies belief that many of his colleagues did not know of such blatant corruption being conducted in the parliamentary precinct. On one occasion he paraded his access to power before a property developer, inviting him to an impromptu visit to NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian in her office.
On Monday the prim and proper Ms Berejiklian, whose prodigious work ethic, attention to detail and dedication to NSW are well known, dropped a bombshell, telling ICAC about her clandestine, five-year close personal relationship with Mr Maguire. It has been clear that her former close friend’s unethical conduct has the potential to seriously undermine her position, perhaps irreparably. That is up to her, or up to her parliamentary colleagues. It says much about Ms Berejiklian’s performance that public sentiment, at this stage, is definitively on the side of giving her a leave pass. Or as Malcolm Turnbull told the ABC on Tuesday: “Gladys is one of the most diligent leaders in Australia today, she is diligent, she is honest. She’s not Robinson Crusoe — she’s human. She fell in love with the wrong guy.” She has Scott Morrison and many others in her corner. At a critical point in containing COVID-19 and generating economic recovery, few relish the prospect of a leadership change in NSW.
That said, standards matter. Our largest and most important state could not sustain a lame-duck leader indefinitely. On Thursday, Ms Berejiklian came out fighting. In a feisty exchange in parliament, Opposition Leader Jodi McKay accused her of being a “sounding board for corruption”. Ms Berejiklian hit back: “I ask (Ms McKay) to withdraw it or say it out there. Either withdraw it or say it outside.” The Premier insisted she had done “nothing wrong”. She’d “worked my guts out for the people of this great state” and would continue to do so. If she is determined to push on, the public deserves to hear a lot more from her about her thinking through the years she was close to Mr Maguire.
Decent people feel natural empathy for anyone whose private life is exposed against their will in such a fashion. But Ms Berejiklian is accountable for her professional rather than her personal judgment. While principle must prevail over pragmatism and expediency, the key question is to what extent did Ms Berejiklian know of the brazen debasement of elected office to which her close personal friend stooped. That is especially important if the steady decline in the esteem for our liberal democratic institutions is to be arrested. For this reason, it is imperative that the ICAC inquiry unravel the complex web of influence surrounding Mr Maguire. Did any ministers make decisions that enriched him? Which bureaucrats, if any, were receptive to his overtures? Did they allocate priority to matters raised by Mr Maguire because they knew he had the ear of the Premier?
There is no suggestion, of course, that she sought any personal gain from Mr Maguire’s ventures. And, as she made clear on Monday, she presumed he had declared his interests. At one point she pointedly made clear that she did not wish to hear details of Mr Maguire’s windfall from a sale of land in the Badgerys Creek area. What does seem clear is that Ms Berejiklian was well aware that Mr Maguire was on the lookout for opportunities to make money to defray large personal debts. Of more concern is her maintenance of a clandestine relationship with Mr Maguire after he was forced to resign from the Liberal Party in July 2018, and three weeks later from parliament. On what is known of Mr Maguire’s conduct and the Premier’s connections to him, she has made grievous errors of judgment. On that measure alone, her colleagues are weighing up what is best for the government and the state. ICAC has previously claimed the political scalps of two decent Liberal premiers — Nick Greiner and Barry O’Farrell — for blemishes that are inconsequential, compared with the naked avarice and abuse of office of Mr Maguire. We will not pre-empt ICAC’s findings and the extent to which Ms Berejiklian has been tainted by the dealings of her trusted friend, who conformed to the stereotype of a venal, self-interested shyster. The final cards are yet to fall.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Wyatt advances recognition	The Australian	Separating the issue from a voice to government is wise
After more than 20 years of false starts, setbacks and debate under both sides of politics, Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt is proceeding steadily and competently towards giving Australians the opportunity to vote on constitutional recognition of Aborigines by June next year. The planned referendum keeps faith with the Coalition’s commitment at last year’s election to work towards “recognition of First Australians in our nation’s founding document” to “acknowledge our shared history and the value we place on our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage”.
Mr Wyatt, the first indigenous minister to hold the portfolio, is proving a wise leader. He favours pragmatism and common sense over ideology. Shrewdly, he is endeavouring to ensure a referendum on recognition does not become confused with the proposed indigenous voice to government. Recognition, as Mr Wyatt says, “needs its own oxygen and its own space”. This approach will improve the chances of recognition being passed not only by a majority of voters in a majority of states but also by a thumping majority — creating a unifying outcome.
The bill to alter the Constitution deserves bipartisan support when the Morrison government puts it to both houses of parliament this year. Once passed, a referendum would need to be held not less than two and no more than six months later.
On Friday Pat Anderson, an Alyawarre woman who helped oversee the Referendum Council report on how best to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution, said she was disappointed with Mr Wyatt’s decision. Indigenous people had expressly rejected symbolic constitutional recognition at the Uluru convention in 2017, she told Paige Taylor. The Uluru statement from the heart called for “a First Nations voice enshrined in the Constitution”. Both the Turnbull and Morrison governments have rejected that call, however. Nor is there much doubt that a referendum about such a proposal would draw strong opposition and would be unlikely to pass, setting back the process of reconciliation for years.
Mr Wyatt is determined to make progress on the voice, however. To that end, indigenous leaders Marcia Langton and Tom Calma are co-chairing a senior advisory group that is due to propose models for the voice at national, regional and local levels by June. After consultation on the models, Mr Wyatt plans to legislate that voice ahead of the referendum on constitutional recognition.
He intends, wisely, to have both issues resolved well ahead of the next federal election due by September 2022, a timetable that will reduce the chances of political pointscoring. Whatever the obstacles, his methodical, low-key approach offers the best chance of progress on an issue where many others, often aiming for too much too soon, have failed. Not unreasonably, Mr Wyatt hopes Uluru backers and the indigenous community in general will get behind the Yes campaign on constitutional recognition. That is their decision. But unity is important, as he argues, “because if there is a division among indigenous Australians then an opportunity will be lost … we are going to have some strong opponents (to constitutional recognition)”.
Mr Wyatt has now intervened in a controversy over the Aboriginal identity of author Bruce Pascoe sparked by indigenous lawyer and entrepreneur Josephine Cashman. Last month, Ms Cashman asked Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton for an investigation into Professor Pascoe for alleged “dishonesty offences”. An Australian Federal Police assessment found Professor Pascoe had committed no commonwealth offence but it did not consider his identity. Mr Wyatt sacked Ms Cashman from the advisory group, saying her actions were “not conducive to the constructive and collaborative approach required to progress the co-design process for an indigenous voice”.The dispute shows how fraught the politics of the portfolio can be and the challenging road ahead towards achieving indigenous recognition.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
14 July 2020 EDITORIAL Coronavirus impact can last long beyond a patient’s ‘recovery’	The Northern Advocate	Seven months on, medical experts and researchers are still learning about the damage Covid-19 can do to people, short of killing them.
The initial emphasis by authorities on the dangers of the coronavirus focused on the fact that it was new and deadly.
It was a respiratory virus not the flu, there was no vaccine, and it was particularly a threat to older people and those with health vulnerabilities.
Perhaps that messaging contributed to the idea that younger people were somewhat invulnerable. They were less likely to die from it or show serious symptoms or any at all.
But we know more about it now and more attention needs to be paid to the many people who get the coronavirus and have to live with its effects. In many cases, Covid-19 has serious symptoms and health impacts that may be ongoing.
Worldwide there have been 565,000 deaths from Covid-19 but 12.6 million confirmed cases.
People do not know which card they will be dealt. They may survive but be left with a permanent medical disability. Previous viruses have done that to many.
And, as the pandemic has unfolded, plenty of people aged under 40 have died or had serious brushes with the virus. ABC reports that the final words of a 30-year-old Texas patient who had attended a "Covid party" hosted by an infected person were: "I think I made a mistake. I thought this was a hoax, but it’s not".
It has also become clear that the coronavirus is a Hydra that can attack multiple organs in the body. They include the lungs, brain, heart, and kidneys. Some patients are still showing chronic symptoms weeks after "recovery".
A University College London study last week was the latest to report that Covid-19 patients could suffer neurological harm including strokes, brain inflammation and nerve damage. These could occur even in cases where respiratory symptoms were not severe. Brain fog and hallucinations have been reported.
The virus is known to cause incidents of blood clotting in large blood vessels. New York University Langone autopsy director Dr Amy Rapkiewicz told CNN that dead patients had clotting in small vessels as well. "This was dramatic because although we might have just expected it in the lungs, we found it in almost every organ that we looked at in our autopsy study."
An outpatient study in Rome, Italy, found that even two months after becoming infected, 87 per cent of people still had symptoms, with 55 per cent having more than three. Many still had fatigue, shortness of breath, joint pain, and chest pain.
The top US government expert on infectious diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci, said last week that there may be a "post-viral syndrome" in which fatigue "can incapacitate them for weeks and weeks following so-called recovery and clearing of the virus" and people "really do not get back to normal".
Such issues need to be kept in mind as we go about life in our protective cocoon.
The risk of dying or getting infected with Covid-19 seem remote at the moment. But should the risk increase at some stage, the coronavirus is something no one would want to live with.

EDITORIAL The shape of things to come	The Northern Advocate	Shapes have become significant analogies for explaining what is going on with the Covid-19 pandemic. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern brandished a graph showing how we could “flatten the curve” of the rate of infections to allow our hospitals time to prepare for outbreaks.
In many respects, the shapes of alert level 4 and level 3 are very similar – work from home if you can, social distance, maintain small spheres of contact, wash hands with soap and cough into elbows, and if sick, stay home and contact a GP.
However, the potential level 3 allows for businesses and schools is shaping as a lifeline for many New Zealanders at breaking point. From next Tuesday, all businesses deemed to be capable of operating safely will be permitted to do so.
The Government had been clear from the start that the strictest level of lockdown was for a minimum of four weeks.
Small Business Minister Stuart Nash has reiterated that level 3 is not an opening up of the economy to a pre-Covid-19 level, it’s a “waiting room” to see whether the Government has got the health measures right. Substantively, the slight easing of restrictions isn’t about economic recovery so much as testing whether we really have flattened the curve. Recovery measures will come, the Government has broadly hinted, as the country moves further down alert levels.
Globally, markets have been responding to such assistance – enacted or indicated – with positivity as more countries tentatively ease business shutdowns and restrictions.
Analysts believe a significant part of the optimism is due to the expectation among investors that the economy will rebound sharply once quarantines are lifted. Once again, shapes are a handy metaphor. They’re essentially predicting that a line chart of the economy will resemble the letter “V”, with a wild ride down but then a quick pivot to a vigorous recovery. That may be too optimistic.
Strategists at Barclays warned in a recent report: “We caution that a U-shaped recovery is also quite likely”, where the economy bottoms out and stays at a low level before gradual recovery.
Health experts warn the pandemic is far from over and new flare-ups could ignite if governments rush to allow “normal” life to return prematurely. This is also the case in New Zealand.
Only after we have been at level 3 for more than two weeks will we know what shape, healthwise, we really are in. — NZ Herald	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
A regional statesman bows out	The Australian	Shinzo Abe’s successor has big shoes to fill in leading Japan Scott Morrison spoke for the nation on Friday when he praised the “leadership, generosity and vision” of outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, describing him as a “true friend” of Australia. As Mr Morrison said, the unprecedented closeness of the vital strategic and economic relationship that now exists between Tokyo and Canberra owes much to the initiative and tireless work of Mr Abe, who, at 65 and after eight years in office, is leaving to deal with worsening health challenges from ulcerative colitis.
Mr Abe has been Japan’s most consequential political leader since World War II. The importance of having Japan accepted as a “normal country” entitled to assume responsibility for its defence would be hard to exaggerate. A law allowing its military forces, constitutionally restricted to self-defence, to operate beyond national borders has permitted it to shift from unsustainable post-war pacifism. Under Mr Abe, Japan has assumed a more muscular posture as a Western ally in defence of freedom and democracy in the Indo-Pacific.
His departure will be a significant loss for Japan, and for the US and the entire Western alliance in confronting escalating Chinese bullying and the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons. As former US national security adviser John Bolton wrote on Saturday, Mr Abe “is the real progenitor” of the “free and open Indo-Pacific mantra”, now the bedrock of US strategy and of allies such as Australia. He has been crucial in helping confront China’s drive to achieve hegemony, and a major influence in building closer strategic co-operation among Japan, India, Australia and the US. He has also led the way in taking a hard line against Kim Jong-un’s aggressive North Korean regime, demanding the elimination of the threat posed by its nuclear and chemical weapons. Mr Bolton praised Mr Abe’s “disciplined diplomacy”, saying it “was like a heavy metal chain tethering the President (Trump) somewhere proximate to reality, rather than getting lost in the Trump/Kim Jong-un rapture”.
As Mr Morrison said, Japan is one of Australia’s closest partners — an achievement driven by successive Australian PMs and Mr Abe’s “personal leadership and vision, including elevating the relationship to new heights under our Special Strategic Partnership. Today, Australia and Japan share a vision for an open, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, strengthened by co-operation between our like-minded countries”. The 2014 free-trade deal Mr Abe concluded with Australia, as former PM Tony Abbott said, “epitomised his commitment to liberal values as well as to Australia”. It is imperative whoever succeeds him is similarly committed to the relationship with Australia and the broader Western alliance. Finding such a successor may not be easy. Before Mr Abe, Japan had seven PMs in seven years. Possible successors include Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, a former economy minister who executed Mr Abe’s “Abenomics” program and negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership alongside Australia; Yoshihide Suga, 71, the chief cabinet secretary close to Mr Abe; Taro Aso, 79, Finance Minister and Mr Abe’s deputy; and Shigeru Ishiba, 63, an abrasive former defence minister who twice ran against Mr Abe for leadership of the LDP. Mr Abe leaves a remarkable legacy and Australians wish him well.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Activist High Court takes nation into tricky territory	The Australian	Shock decision raises prospect of revolt on indigenous voice
In his address to federal parliament on Monday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo warned “identity politics is a threat to democracy” because it leads to hatred, fear and conflict. The next day the High Court rolled in with a landmark decision that up-ends the meaning of “aliens” in the Constitution and spreads a judicial vibe from the historic Mabo decision into migration cases and who knows where else. The court, albeit split 4-3, has taken an adventure ride with identity politics and the shocks will spread across our land. The Morrison government said the decision created “a new category of persons”, neither an alien nor citizen. Legal expert Anne Twomey, writing in our pages on Wednesday, argued it could create special rights or privileges for Aboriginal people, even a race-based constitutional distinction.
The court was asked to decide questions arising from section 51 (xix) of the Constitution, which provides the parliament has power to make laws with respect to “naturalisation and aliens”. The plaintiffs are men born in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, not Australian citizens, who were facing deportation after failing migration character tests as a result of committing violent assaults here. Their lawyers argued the power should be read so as not to apply to a person who is not a citizen of Australia, who is a citizen of a foreign country and is not naturalised as an Australian citizen, but who is an Aboriginal person. The majority judges may as well have said the Constitution’s framers had this limitation or exception in mind but did not write it down.
All seven judges accepted the “tripartite” definition of Aboriginality that had been set out in the Mabo case. This requires that a person be the biological descendant of Aboriginal people who lived in Australia before British settlement, identify as an Aboriginal person and be recognised as an Aboriginal person by the elders or other persons who have traditional authority to do so. Fair enough, but the majority justices have taken the law for a walk. Justice Michelle Gordon pointed out that Australian law already recognises the connection between Aboriginal Australians and Australia’s land and waters, and therefore they cannot be classified as “aliens”. For her, native title was but one legal consequence of the common law’s recognition of the connection; exclusion of Aboriginal Australians from the term “alien” was another. As Professor Twomey observes, this logic leaves open the question of whether a host of other legal consequences will be identified in the future. Wait and see.
Chief Justice Susan Kiefel said it was wrong to apply the connection to land required in native title cases to an “entirely different area of the law”. She said a mechanism by which Aboriginal communities would have the power to determine when normal migration laws will apply “would be to attribute to the group the kind of sovereignty which was implicitly rejected by (the Mabo decision)”. Justice Patrick Keane argued this confused rights of property with citizenship. Aliens can own land in Australia but still need a visa to visit.
The third dissenter, Justice Stephen Gageler, raised practical issues about Australia’s immigration program. He was concerned about relegating people to a “constitutional netherworld” of non-citizens who are non-aliens. It’s illogical and applies only to indigenous people who are citizens of another land. Cutting through in her dissent, however, Chief Justice Kiefel pointed out that it is settled law and up to parliament to create and define the concept of citizenship and determine who is an alien. Otherwise the court is usurping the role of parliament.Invariably the decision brings us to constitutional recognition of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the proposed voice to parliament. Justice Gageler expressed concern no such voice had informed the court in the case at hand given the potential ramifications of this decision. If there is to be “constitutionally mandated differential treatment of some or all, then the Constitution should be amended to produce that result by referendum”, he wrote. Does the court’s judgment create “special rights or privileges” for Aboriginal people and a race-based constitutional distinction? This will be hotly debated and will undeniably inform the fraught politics on the road to a referendum. We support an indigenous voice to parliament and the process by which the Morrison government is refining the question to be put to the people this term. But the dissenting judges have highlighted the possible pitfalls, where the personal values and philosophies of judges, or “creativity” from the bench, hold constitutional sway. Will the Australian public trust a court that is prone to such frolics and the vibe?	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
McGowan decimates WA Libs, adding to federal woe	The Australian	Short of imploding, Labor will dominate state politics in the west
It is usual, after heavy state election losses, for federal politicians from the losing party to distance themselves from the results on the grounds that voters distinguish between the different arenas. They do, as Scott Morrison noted on Sunday. But he and the Liberal Party face a massive challenge after Mark McGowan’s historic victory in Western Australia, and Labor took the state Liberal Party to the edge of extinction, as Paul Kelly described it.
Behind closed doors, the Prime Minister and his team have much to repair. For years, Liberal support at federal level in WA has been as steady as a rock, often clinching victory for the party late into counting on federal election nights. But the Labor Party’s monumental win in the state on Saturday will weaken the Liberals federally in the west, not least in terms of campaign funding from the public purse. The WA division will have little in the kitty to fight the federal election, later this year or early next year.
The Morrison government recently farewelled its strongest performer from the west, Mathias Cormann; and before him, Julie Bishop in 2019. Attorney-General Christian Porter and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds are fighting the battles of their lives. In part because of the rape scandals enveloping them, the government trails the opposition 48-52 per cent in the two-party-preferred vote in the latest Newspoll. Mr Morrison retains his strong lead over Anthony Albanese. But his margin as preferred prime minister has narrowed from 35 points to 26.
Mr McGowan, who won an extraordinary 82 per cent of the primary vote in his seat of Rockingham southwest of Perth, is on track to win 52 out of 59 lower house seats. Political analysts predict Labor will take control of the upper house. If so, Mr McGowan and his team will have near-unfettered power — and with it an enormous responsibility. He has offered up some sensible advice, which other Labor leaders, especially, could learn from. He had oriented the party, he said, to appeal to a wide cross-section of the community, including workers, small business people and subcontractors. His team was “very centrist, we are very middle-of-the-road”, he says. That balanced, shrewd outlook should help Mr McGowan avoid the fate of former Queensland premier Campbell Newman, who won government in a landslide in 2012 and lost it in an even bigger landslide in 2015.
For Mr McGowan, the strength of the WA economy was a powerful factor at the ballot box. As we reported recently, WA recorded the best budget performance in the world through the COVID-19 pandemic, boosted by surging iron ore royalties. Mr McGowan’s move, early in the pandemic, to allow mining companies to continue to fly in workers set the budget up for success. And like it or loathe it — and there are good reasons to loathe it — Mr McGowan’s rigid border controls appealed to voters.
The Liberal Party in WA did Opposition Leader Zak Kirkup, 34, its fourth leader in four years, no favours. He lost his seat on Saturday, after his first term. Nor did Mr Kirkup, who was pushed into a hard job too early, do his team any favours. Conceding three weeks ago that the Liberals had already lost was a bad mistake. So, in a resources state, was the party’s ambitious green energy plan. Outpolled by the Liberals, the Nationals are expected to be the official opposition. The non-Labor parties need a massive repair job. At state level, they have four years to put their houses in order. For the federal Coalition, however, it is a matter of urgency.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Reassert constitutional norms	The Australian	Silence of ‘rights’ activists is testimony to their irrelevance As well as economic damage, COVID-19 has left our personal liberties and democratic institutions in a critical condition. The damage has been inflicted mainly by the arrogant authoritarianism of premiers. Yet, as Adam Creighton wrote on Tuesday, barely a squeak of indignation has been raised by the expensive human rights lobby. Victoria is home to a veritable human rights industry, with numerous law schools hosting so-called human rights centres. But their record reveals an obsession with identity politics rather than protection of fundamental rights to free speech and association.
Quick to denounce hard borders against illegal entry, activists remained quiescent as states trampled all over Section 92 of the Constitution, which guarantees that intercourse among states shall be “absolutely free”. No section of our Constitution was more rigorously debated leading up to Federation in 1901 than Section 92. Entry by clients of people-smuggling racketeers in Southeast Asia is of more concern, evidently, to the commissars of compassion than the effective house arrest of Melburnians by executive diktat. The Victorian Human Rights Commission remarked, with comic understatement, that the pandemic “exposed some weaknesses in the way the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities protects Victorians from violations of their rights”.
Our Westminster system and formal Constitution have served the nation well. We do not need a Bill of Rights, which would empower unelected judges at the expense of the people and become the lever for assaults on alleged “hate speech” by well-funded activists. As the leaking and media manipulation of various state corruption watchdogs has revealed, we need more accountability from our executive to the people through the established norms of responsible government. Federal and state leaders have been culpable in the resort to government-by-decree. One step the Morrison government could take is to appoint serious constitutional lawyers with a demonstrated commitment to strict legalism to the High Court when it considers the matter this week.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
EDITORIAL Nats leader too hasty ruling out deal with Winston	The Northern Advocate	Simon Bridges has taken the biggest punt of his career – and his attempt to kneecap NZ First by refusing to work with them could easily turn him into a political cripple.
Bridges insists it was his call to refuse to work with Winston Peters and claims his party is, to a person, happy and relieved by his decision not to work with NZ First.
The National leader has jumped the gun, declaring his hand way too soon.
His decision is quite different to the same decision made by John Key before the 2008 election. Key had options; namely the Maori Party, United Future and Act.
That move saw NZ First out of Parliament, mainly because of a donations saga, and even though Key rejected them again in 2014, they were back with a vengeance with eight MPs.
Currently, Bridges has just one option, with just one MP, thanks to an ongoing soft deal with Act in the Epsom seat.
And that’s what MMP is all about, whether we like it or not: It’s cutting deals.
It’s as though Bridges has rejected MMP, believing National will be first past the post with 51per cent of the vote at the coming election, not done since MMP came into being in 1996.
So Labour has now been given plenty of time to sharpen it’s electoral pencil, doing the sums in Northland, a seat Peters lost at the last election.
The sums will tell them he, or possibly Shane Jones, could pull it off if they do an Epsom deal there, sacrificing the electorate vote in a seat they’re unlikely to win anyway.
It also gives NZ First time to strategise about how they pitch themselves to the electorate.
National failed before the last election to wipe out NZ First, even though Bill English pleaded with voters to cut out the middle man.
Bridges is telling voters if they want a National government they’ll have to vote for it.
He insists Peters can’t be trusted but, when asked why, came up with a curious argument, which cuts to the heart of what MMP is all about, again whether we like it or not, saying the public is sick of the charade of Peters holding the country to ransom for weeks while he makes up his mind on who to anoint as Prime Minister.
Bridges may have removed the choice from Peters, but he’s just increased the odds against him getting the job he so wants.

Lessons fighting a lethal enemy	The Australian	Singapore was quick to take decisive action on COVID-19
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was right to be cautious about his country’s achievements in battling coronavirus. “It is not that the tide has turned, it is that we put the dykes up,” he told our newspaper on Monday. But with good news about the global fight against the contagion in short supply and an alarming 800 people having died on a single day in Italy (more than on any one day at its peak in China), there is no doubt Singapore’s relative success and that of other states in our region carry lessons for all desperately seeking ways to turn back the tide. As an Asian business and transit hub with close links to China, Singapore, with 5.6 million people, might have been expected to provide fertile ground for the virus’s rapid spread. Singapore is one of the world’s most densely populated cities. Yet by being quick off the mark and launching aggressive action to contain the outbreak, it has had only 455 cases, with two deaths.
Singapore is not alone in being what Mr Lee terms “reasonably successful”. Taiwan, its population at 24 million similar to Australia’s, has Beijing breathing down its neck. It is only 180km from the Chinese mainland. There is intense traffic across the Strait of Taiwan. Yet it has had only 169 cases with two deaths. Hong Kong’s population of 7.4 million, living cheek by jowl alongside China, has had 317 cases with four deaths. South Korea, too, offers a positive perspective amid the gloom: with a population of 52 million and almost 9000 cases, it has had remarkable success in keeping deaths down to just over 100. Mr Lee attributed Singapore’s success to the unrelenting “checking out all people any infected person may have unwittingly infected”. Technology including CCTV has been used to “contact-trace” several thousand potential carriers, while aggressive action from the start, with clear public messaging and extensive testing, has been highly effective in ensuring early detection and isolation of carriers. Hong Kong has followed Singapore’s strategy, while Taiwan and South Korea have pursued a course of mass testing (as of March 19, South Korea had conducted more than 307,000 tests, the highest in the world), followed by rigorous “contact tracing” and the immediate quarantining of the carrier’s contacts. In all four jurisdictions, strict rules imposing social distancing have been unrelentingly applied.Governments confront different circumstances. But the contrast between the relative success of the Asian states and the catastrophe in Italy, where so far there have been 5476 deaths out of 59,138 cases, could not be greater. Italian writer Mattia Ferrarasi puts his country’s tragic plight down to delays and inaction; it took weeks after the virus first appeared before there was the realisation severe measures were unavoidable. Countries are paying a terrible price for that failure to act early to get ahead of COVID-19’s trajectory and strictly enforce measures to meet the greatest challenge of our times.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
A not-so-ordinary memoir	The Australian	Sir Peter’s life exemplifies what makes us special as a nation
The term “living national treasure” has been devalued by overuse. But if there is one Australian to whom it can be applied, that is Sir Peter Cosgrove, who launched his memoir, You Shouldn’t Have Joined … , in Sydney on Tuesday. Sir Peter has lived a rich life. He rose to be the Chief of the Australian Defence Force and, ultimately, governor-general. The thread running through Sir Peter’s life has been unselfish service to the nation. He served as a young infantry officer in the Vietnam War, being awarded the Military Cross for bravery in combat. He also served the nation alongside our US ally in Iraq and Afghanistan. No one is better qualified to make judgments about the intricate moral calculus facing soldiers fighting implacable foes far from home.
He alluded to this in remarks about the extreme demands placed on our Special Forces in Afghanistan. Sir Peter did not condone war crimes but put in context the pressures entailed in multiple deployments, and warned against throwing the baby out with the bathwater by diluting the warrior ethos of elite troops. Our Special Forces, as he said, needed to “co-operate right up to the edge of ferocity, confidence, courage, diligence, all that sort of thing. But never to step over the line”.
Sir Peter rose to national prominence as commander of INTERFET, which restored order to East Timor after pro-Indonesian militia embarked upon a bloody rampage against pro-independence forces. At the time, he was nearing retirement after a successful but almost anonymous army career. But in 1999, the East Timor crisis transformed then Major General Cosgrove’s place in the esteem of Australians. His presence reassured a nation that had been at peace for many years and found itself in conflict with our largest neighbour. The hour and the man came together, with Australians seeing their best selves reflected in a soldier who was without affectation or artifice, brave and calm in a crisis, and leading a mission to help the underdog. Few in public life could match his raw, engaging authenticity. For a man whose professional life was steeped in the application of violence, Major General Cosgrove, paradoxically, always seemed to rise above the fray. After his exemplary leadership in Timor, his rise continued as a much admired, unifying figure as Chief of the Army, Chief of Defence and governor-general. To every role, he brought the same distinct qualities of leadership, authenticity and manifest decency. As Australian of the Year and as governor-general he met huge numbers of citizens, who invariably recalled encounters with him as memories to cherish. His demeanour was the same whether at Buckingham Palace or a regional show. As Paul Kelly said in launching the memoir, it is that of a man who says he’s always been a “very ordinary bloke … who’s led an extraordinary life”. In this he was ably supported by his wife, Lady Lynne Cosgrove. They are an example for all who aspire to leadership.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
State of disaster resorts to desperate Covid measures	The Australian	Slowing transmission as fast as possible is what matters Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is right: this cannot go on for another six months. The state’s new restrictions to curtail coronavirus — especially the 8pm-5am curfew that began Sunday night after a few hours’ notice — are reminiscent of living under martial law in authoritarian regimes. Through world wars and the 1930s Depression, no Australian city has seen anything like it. The measures, to apply for six weeks, and new restrictions on workplaces and industries being announced on Monday, will cost workers, their families, businesses and the national economy billions of dollars and intense stress. Taxpayers will suffer the fallout for years, if not decades.
That said, the central objective of Victoria’s state of disaster declared on Sunday is worthwhile — provided it works. Rather than limping along until Christmas or the new year with hundreds of new COVID-19 cases every day and ongoing lockdowns, the aim is to radically contain the virus in a limited time, reducing transmission to as close to zero cases a day as possible. In an interconnected world powered by trade, containment and not elimination, must remain the goal.
Victoria’s caseload increased by 671 on Sunday, with seven more deaths, bringing the national toll to 208. The latest victims were in their 70s, 80s and 90s. Case numbers have risen in triple digits since early July and spiralled during Melbourne’s stage three restrictions. On Sunday, Victoria’s seven-day average daily increase rose to a record 518. But the rest of the nation is in a strong position, with NSW fighting hard, through effective tracing, to hold the line. But COVID is inclined to “get away’’, as Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Sunday. Across the world, another million cases have been diagnosed in the past four days.
While asking a lot of Victorians, Mr Andrews’s government also needs to ask a lot more of itself. It has gone for broke in imposing six weeks of unprecedented restrictions. If its gamble is to succeed, it needs to use that hiatus to remedy some of the shortcomings that have brought the state to this point. The restrictions will demand heavy sacrifices from all age groups, with more to come on Monday. But Mr Andrews has said little about how his government plans to improve its performance in dealing with the virus. There can be no room in the coming six weeks for the kinds of mistakes to date. These include poor messaging to non-English-speaking groups and the shambles over lapses by private protection firms engaged to oversee hotel quarantining. The priorities, however, must be remedying delays in providing COVID-19 test results and delays and gaps in contact tracing. Of 6322 active cases in Victoria, 760 are what Mr Andrews described as “mystery cases’’, yet to be traced to an original source. The number shows the work facing health authorities.
The 8pm curfew, limiting essential shopping and exercise to within 5km of Melburnians’ homes, confining students to home learning and other restrictions are designed to “limit the amount of movement, therefore limiting the amount of transmission’’ of the virus, Mr Andrews says. Anything less would see the pandemic drag on “for months and months and months’’. The stage four measures will be backed by $1652 fines for those violating them, or thousands more if cases are taken to court. Doorknocks to check if patients who have the virus are at home will be stepped up. This is sensible. As Scott Morrison says, the measures are needed, regrettably, to save lives. But Melburnians in good health who are unable to visit a friend for coffee or leave their homes after 8pm, even while adhering to hygiene rules and maintaining a safe distance, are entitled to ask if doing so would be more dangerous to public health than patients waiting days for test results or, in some cases, up to a fortnight before contact tracing begins. For good reason, doctors have complained about health bureaucrats’ discouraging them from testing the family members or work colleagues of people with COVID-19 unless they showed symptoms or had a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services confirming them as a close contact of an infected person. Such letters can take time, with delays creating manifold opportunities for contagion. Ugly as its numbers were, the Morrison government’s July 23 economic statement, a harbinger of chronic budget weakness for years, was not predicated on a six-week stage four lockdown of the economy of the nation’s second-largest city. The cost of the pandemic to taxpayers will now, obviously, be far higher, with Victorians to be given expanded access to welfare benefits. The ultimate cost of the new lockdown will also depend, in part, on effectiveness. The speed and trajectory of the national economic recovery, will be “dependent on our progress on the health front”, as Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Sunday. At one of the darkest moments in our peacetime history, it is reasonable to weigh up the merits of responses to the crisis and whether restrictions are proportionate and likely to work. The consequences of failure would be catastrophic, in terms of health and for our economic future and quality of life. The Prime Minister told Victorians: “Australians all around the country are backing you in, because we all know for Australia to succeed, we need for Victoria to get through this.” Desperate times demand desperate measures. The next six weeks will show how well the Andrews government can make this desperate strategy work.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
In defence of motherhood	The Australian	Slowly but surely the thought and speech police are pushing the bounds of equality further into the realm of misogyny. The politics of offence has become offensive to what has been a bedrock of civilised society, the nurturing, protection and celebration of motherhood. If culture lives in language, the full-frontal assault now being waged against the natural order of childbirth and motherly affection posits a bleak future for Western civilisation. The latest example of censure, which would be inconceivable to most citizens, comes from the UK parliament, where legislation on paid maternity leave for MPs has become entangled in the culture war on women. As Jacquelin Magnay wrote on Wednesday, there are no pregnant women in the bill, only pregnant persons. Women in Britain also have lost their right to breastfeed, they must now chest-feed, lest they offend transgender parents who no longer want to be considered female despite having given birth. Acceptance of difference has become a tyranny of conformity.
The co-opting of maternity leave legislation by politically correct language police has outraged members of the House of Lords. The push is part of a bigger movement to delegitimise the status of women generally. Self-identification is sufficient for anyone, regardless of gender, to be admitted to women’s hospital wards and single-sex jails. Conservative politician Baroness Sheila Noakes said she was not prepared to be erased as a woman regardless of any abuse she might receive on social media. Billionaire author JK Rowling has been the high-profile target for virtue-signalling shamers. She was accused of hate speech for ridiculing a World Health Organisation definition of women as “people who menstruate”, despite only half of the female population being of menstrual age at any one time. Rowling’s name has since been removed from school buildings in Britain, despite her Harry Potter novels being the catalyst for a generation of children to discover the joy of reading. LGBT+ campaigners blame her for Britain’s slide down the ranking of Europe’s equality index from first to 10th. For inclusion on some lists there is a price that is too high. Confusing biological sex with gender identity and thereby devaluing the status of women is a folly. We agree with Lady Noakes that there is no malice in wishing to maintain the biological facts of womanhood and the lived experience of women, which includes menstruation, childbirth and menopause. It is a view that can happily coexist with respect and concern for transgender people.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Health failings mean minister should go	The New Zealand Herald	So much for “a week is a long time in politics”; it only took a day to wipe the smile off New Zealand’s collective Covid-free face.
Monday marked the Ministry of Health’s “elimination day” — the magic number of 28 days (two full cycles of the virus’ transmission) of no new cases since the last community transmission case came out of isolation.
It was “official” confirmation the Government’s “go hard and go early” strategy and all the hard work and sacrifice by the “whānau of five million” had paid off. Official vindication of our past week basking in our Covid-free glory, our newfound alert level 1 freedoms, the world’s accolades for crushing the virus, and the Prime Minister’s “little dance”.
Yet a day later we had two new cases: Two women who flew to Auckland from Britain, had been in managed isolation, got a compassionate exemption to visit a dying parent, and who travelled to Wellington where they tested positive for Covid.
New Zealanders have been told the harsh lockdown measures, the economic pain were for a reason. We’ve been told about the work to get our lab testing and our contact tracing up to speed, told of the necessity for our strict border restrictions and funeral rules, told we could be confident in our quarantine and exemption measures.
How could it go so wrong, and who is to blame?
It appears one of the women was symptomatic but had put it down to an underlying condition, and the health checks in managed isolation were not performed adequately so did not catch that.
There are no winners here.
The Government had previously been criticised for its lack of compassion and exceptions around funerals and tangi, and allowed for special exemptions. It has now revoked them. An obviously frustrated Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern yesterday backed Health Minister David Clark, saying they had been let down; that the checks and balances they had been assured were in place had not been adhered to. She has appointed assistant chief of defence Air Commodore Darren Digby Webb to oversee all quarantine and isolation facilities.
Director general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield has taken responsibility for the failings and “ensuring this does not happen again”.
That is essential to fix the clear flaws in the system. But is it enough? So many people have been let down: The women themselves, other individuals hoping for similar exemptions, staff and guests at the Novotel Auckland, and all New Zealanders, who must now be wondering who to trust, fearful about the re-emergence of the virus and a return to higher alert levels. And what now for our transtasman or other travel bubbles?
Clark has surely reached the end of the line. He should offer his resignation or be fired by the PM. He is ultimately responsible for this significant breach, which comes after revelations two teens breached the same rules and went AWOL after attending a funeral, and his own personal travel-rule breaches during lockdown.
There must be meaningful accountability here; the whānau of five million deserves better.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Our vital role	Herald on Sunday	So, you’ve picked up your copy of the Herald on Sunday, or you’re reading this editorial online. You are clearly someone who not only values the role of the fourth estate — but is prepared to pay for it too. Thank you.
One of the cruellest ironies of the coronavirus pandemic is the number of New Zealanders accessing vital news and information from traditional and trusted media outlets has skyrocketed at a time when the major enabler of that content provision — advertising revenue — has virtually dried up overnight as businesses go into enforced hibernation and worse courtesy of the alert level 4 lockdown.
Media outlets are by no means the only businesses feeling the pinch, but the sector is facing an existential crisis exacerbated by Covid-19.
On Wednesday, Parliament’s Epidemic Response Committee, heard from several media companies — including NZME, publisher of the Herald on Sunday — about issues and possible solutions.
As well as immediate lockdown-related matters around printing and distribution, they include more far-reaching problems: asking the Government to rethink ownership models, tax policies, content charges and public advertising spend on the likes of Facebook and Google, who have soaked up much of the advertising dollar despite sometimes being used as platforms for fostering misinformation.
It is clear New Zealanders have never valued the media more. Yet that value is not always reflected in revenue.
This masthead, our associated titles, websites and radio stations all take our role and responsibilities seriously. We are fighting for our survival but remain committed to our purpose. We provide a vital role as a watchdog in a functioning democracy; will continue to strive to provide a variety of voices that reflect and challenge New Zealanders; will continue to provide avenues of quality news, support, information and entertainment for New Zealanders in these unsettling times. In doing so, we remain ever thankful for those who support us.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Time to treat people like adults	The Australian	Social distancing need not mean anti-social policing
It was comforting to hear from Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton on Tuesday that his officers weren’t issuing social-distancing fines just “for the fun of it”, because recent interpretation of government policy has made the Tower of Babel look coherent. We are told the medical experts agree that maintaining a separation of 1.5m from another person is sufficient to prevent any virus-laden droplets that escape their mouth from infecting us. (The World Health Organisation says 1m, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says 2m, so let’s split the difference.) On the face of it, that doesn’t seem a concept of enormous complexity. Stay out of range and you should be fine. But our lawmakers have created guidelines to help us understand what it means to stay 1.5m away from someone, and they are being applied with a breathtaking lack of rigour and logic.
One of this newspaper’s subscribers reported on Tuesday that he was advised by police that a 10-minute car journey with his wife to visit their son was acceptable under the “care” provisions but a slightly longer journey to visit their daughter was not. There is no definition of how many kilometres you are allowed to travel; it is at the police officer’s discretion. Hence the Victorian teenager fined for being too far from home on a driving lesson, the old ladies in NSW fined for sitting at a beauty spot “without reasonable excuse”, the Queenslander fined for using a council tip that was open, and a hundred other stories of overzealous policing.
These fines were overturned, of course, as they should have been, but the resentment they stir is not so easily undone. As police patrol above us in their helicopters and pilot their drones, lights flashing and sirens blaring, they do themselves no favours. Officers marching down beaches ordering people off the sand, or ushering people out of parks for not exercising vigorously enough: yes, it’s ludicrous.
But when the absurdity is stripped away, a patronising, infantilising undercurrent is revealed. It’s probably safe to assume that nobody actually wants to contract COVID-19, even if they are not afraid of doing so. So the 1.5m rule should be sufficient. We are grown-ups; we get it. All the situations where closer contact was inevitable have been closed down.
People can now conclude that if they detect no risk of infection, it is probably not there; they will certainly conclude that there is no possible reason a young police constable is better equipped to assess that risk than any other citizen. When that officer’s arbitrary judgment is backed up with fines and threats of imprisonment, you invite contempt for the law. Criminalise law-abiding citizens for offences that Blind Freddie could see make no sense and you diminish the legitimate authority of, and respect for, the police. Travel may not be essential, nor some of the items in our shopping baskets, but what is essential is a consistent, clear message from those who make the laws.As Mr Patton points out, it’s no laughing matter. Politicians and law enforcement agencies govern and police by consent; if that trust is damaged it may take longer to rebuild than our crumbling economy. Our governments should perhaps be planning how to begin relaxing these restrictions. If in fact they are in no hurry to do so, they might at least have the courtesy to treat us like adults.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
COMMENT The dangers of social media outrage	Bay of Plenty Times	Social media interactions have become akin to prison violence.
There are no rules, disputes escalate rapidly and strangers shank each other in the comment sections.
There is plenty to be outraged by in the modern era; black lives absolutely do matter and there are glaring disparities in equality that need to be recognised, discussed and righted.
That being said, on Wednesday we saw an example of what can happen when the social media masses jump too quickly and thoughtlessly on an issue.
Rotorua’s Gavin Eggleton received death threats and abuse on Facebook after commenting that tā moko is a “bar code” for Work and Income.
Rightfully, in my opinion, the 65-year-old was called out for his comment.
It was screenshotted and shared hundreds of times. I have no issue with that.
Unfortunately, an innocent party was caught in the crossfire.
Eggleton was wrongly linked by people sharing his comment as the manager or owner of a Rotorua motel, Emerald Spa Resort on Fenton St, which prompted calls for people to protest outside the motel and boycott it.
It has been more than 10 years since he owned the motel.
The motel had its reputation dragged through the mud all over Facebook on Wednesday afternoon because people believed something they read online.
None of the people who posted saying Eggleton was still the owner questioned that information. None thought to check that information.
This is one of the dangers of social media. It’s a lawless place where anything can be stated as fact and backed up by others who are equally wrong.
This is also why we have media organisations such as newspapers and their websites.
As journalists, we are held to high standards, we fact check, seek balance and are held accountable by legislation.
So, by all means, fight for what you believe in. Call out comments that are unacceptable.
But try to see through the initial red mist before going on the attack, check your facts and rely only on trustworthy sources.

Australia’s Pacific step-up must help counter poverty	The Australian	Solomon Islands’ leaders are deeply vulnerable to China
Australia has good reason to be deeply concerned about the vulnerability of Solomon Islands to Chinese influence. The archipelago, site of the decisive Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942 and 1943 won by the US and allies including Australia against Japan, is strategically located. It also has deepwater harbours ideal for naval bases. Despite receiving hundreds of millions of dollars a year in foreign aid from Australia, the Pacific Islands nation of 650,000 people has been unable to prevent a handful of its children living in the rubbish tip of Honiara, the nation’s capital. That incompetence also is reflected in the willingness of Solomon Islands Treasurer Harry Kuma to consider a $US100bn loan, with a $US11bn fee, late last year from “unspecified donors”. The windfall, which is yet to eventuate, was offered through a purported Beijing-based financier who signed himself “Terry Wong”. Mr Kuma’s department advised “the rewards far outweigh the risk”. But the mysterious offer would have left Solomon Islands with a world-leading debt of 77 times GDP, as Ben Packham reported on Monday.
The timing was interesting. The bonanza was offered weeks after Solomon Islands severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan in September last year. At the time, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare declared Taiwan was “completely useless to us”. China, he said, would be a better partner “because it could stand up to Australia”. A report by his government on the benefits of switching allegiance from Taiwan to China exposed Solomon Islands’ mendicant mentality. The nation “stands to benefit a lot”, the report said, by normalising diplomatic relations with China. At the same time, the Solomon Islands government chose to ignore a scathing assessment by the Central Bank of Solomon Islands. The bank warned Chinese largesse would result in soaring debt levels. It also noted that Pacific countries allied with Taiwan had higher growth rates than those allied to China.
Graham Lloyd, who visited Solomon Islands as part of The Australian’s China Diaspora series, reported on Monday that Honiara residents said desperate living conditions were a reason many local people were prepared to turn to China in search of greater infrastructure spending. In 2006, a major Australian-led campaign to relocate families from the rubbish tip failed within months. Some families moved out of the tip in 2006 returned shortly after to make money from scavenging metal.Much of Australia’s aid to the Solomons, which will be $174.4m this year, down almost $14m from last year, will be used for road funding, governance, law and order, gender equity and empowering women. The latter is a peculiar priority when children are camped out on the rubbish tip and Guadalcanal’s garbage and sanitation problems are deteriorating. The Morrison government, under its Pacific step-up, needs to ensure Australia’s aid is carefully targeted. There is no doubt that Solomon Islands and other Pacific nations would benefit from prudent support from Australia. Mr Kuma’s letter to the mysterious “Terry Wong”, warmly welcoming his $US100bn finance offer, suggests Solomon Islands officials are naive at best and willing to throw in their lot with China.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Another step in a long campaign for equality	The Australian	Some are willing to exploit the issue to prosecute a broader agenda
A combination of events has propelled the rights of women to safety at work and out in public to the top of the agenda, with uncertain consequences for both sides of politics. The fact that thousands of women and men attended protest demonstrations at Parliament House and in capital cities and regional centres on Monday makes it clear this is an issue with deep emotional and political traction. These concerns will not be dealt with simply by acknowledging legal frameworks for workplace behaviour, anti-discrimination and sexual relations already exist. It is true there are genuine cases of predatory behaviour against women both in the workplace and in public that must be constantly addressed. It is equally true that, as with Black Lives Matter, climate change and other popular causes, there are forces willing to exploit the issue to prosecute a broader political and social agenda.
The worrying sign is that many people now calling for redress are quite prepared to bypass the foundation principles of justice, including the presumption of innocence and right to a fair trial, and thereby compromise the rule of law. The fallout from allegations of rape made by former staffer Brittany Higgins against a co-worker in Parliament House and claims made against Attorney-General Christian Porter from when he was a teenager are just the beginning. Protesters are not only complaining about how Ms Higgins was treated when her allegations were made, or even how the rape allegations against Mr Porter have been dealt with. They are also saying the cases are symptomatic of how all women are treated in the workplace when they are not heard and when the system seeks to suppress complaints or not deal with them seriously. Hence the slogan, Enough.
Newspoll results taken when the Higgins and Porter allegations were high in the public mind show support for the Morrison government falling sharply despite the Prime Minister’s approval remaining high. On primary votes, the Coalition and Labor are on 39 per cent each. On a two-party-preferred measure, Labor has moved to an election-winning lead of 52-48 per cent, a four-point turnaround. But the fallout for Labor may be just beginning. A list of grievances is circulating that details allegations against ALP members. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has encouraged complainants to come forward, just as Scott Morrison supported the rights of demonstrators to make their voices heard.
Mr Porter has launched defamation proceedings against the ABC for publishing accusations against him, which Chris Merritt says will help restore the rule of law and provide a dose of reality for the lynch mob in parts of the media. For Parliament House, Janet Albrechtsen argues on Tuesday that Mr Morrison should take the initiative and reform working conditions in Canberra by reducing working hours, banning alcohol and introducing drug and alcohol testing for workers, including MPs and staff. Ms Higgins, the woman at the centre of rape allegations in the office of then defence industry minister Linda Reynolds, told Monday’s protests she had come forward in the hope of protecting other women. “I don’t believe people should be isolated, intimidated and ignored after traumatic incidents inside the workplace,” she said. The forces unleashed go beyond Ms Higgins’ personal experience, which already is the subject of workplace investigations.
For many, public airing of allegations of sexual abuses in the workplace continues a reformation of workplace culture that began only last century. Former federal sex discrimination commissioner Pru Goward gave context to the workplace transformation in her speech to commemorate International Women’s Day in 2002. She said the 1907 Harvester Judgment, which established a living wage, made clear the mark of a prosperous nation like Australia was that it could afford to keep its women at home. Disparity in pay between men and women was justified on the basis that the basic wage was one that allowed a man to support himself, his wife and three children. World War II saw women enter the workforce in large numbers. After the war, rather than being locked out of work, women began to invest in their careers by identifying themselves with their work, and by investing time and money in training and education.
Reforms now taken for granted did not appear until relatively recently. From 1966, women were no longer forced to relinquish paid work when they got married. Equal pay was granted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in 1972. The first Reclaim the Night marches held to protest violence and sexual assault against women took place in 1978.
The right to safety at work and in public is a legitimate community expectation and, as Caroline Overington wrote on Monday, an issue for men as well as women. Ultimately, it is a matter of public education, personal responsibility, good example and making sure the rule of law is fairly applied. This includes giving Mr Porter the right to a fair hearing in court against the ABC for defamation, and by supporting those who need help by building a community culture in which complaints are heard and systems are in place to get to the truth and offer protection.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Public secto r staff bonanzas	The Australian	Some of the bonuses make luxury watches seem modest
Many taxpayers, especially those fed up with “snail mail” that increasingly lived up to its nickname, would agree with Scott Morrison that four Australia Post staff receiving Cartier watches worth $20,000 in total as a reward in 2018 was “disgraceful” and “not on”. Australia Post’s former chief executive, Christine Holgate, resigned on Monday following the revelation, which emerged at a Senate committee hearing. The issue was always complex, however. And it has become much more so in light of Adam Creighton’s revelation that four of the federal government’s largest regulators and statutory authorities paid bonuses worth $13.2m last year to 1700 executives and other senior staff members. Those bodies were the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.
On Monday, Nick Tabakoff reported that three ABC staff members earning between $370,000 and $395,000 a year pocketed average bonuses of $18,133 each — almost enough to buy four of the controversial Cartier watches. Senior ABC staff members in other pay grades received bonuses ranging from an average of $5333 to $8750 each.
Bonuses are widely incorporated in salary packages in the private sector, especially in professional services firms — depending on outcomes — and in companies in which the bottom line depends on sales performance. Some experienced leaders in government bodies, however, doubt that bonuses are appropriate in the public sector.
Government agencies, especially those in highly skilled roles who could command top dollars in industry, should be well paid. Allan Fels, who was chairman of the ACCC for eight years to 2003, told Creighton that bonuses were rarely appropriate in the public sector, where it was “very hard to evaluate performance”. A former head of one of the four regulatory agencies paying generous bonuses said the problem was that bonuses had become “almost the expectation”. That defeats their purpose entirely. As the former executive said, bonuses should be paid only for performance that is “super beyond expectations”. How that should be determined, however, is not clear.
At a time of low wage rises, many taxpayers with busy jobs are finding themselves working harder than before, for the same salary, without bonuses. They will be annoyed to learn they footed the bill for corporate regulator ASIC, for example, to pay 1355 workers, or 70 per cent of its staff, average bonuses of $7130 last year.
For the Morrison government, the issue is one of consistency after it took such a strong stand against the watches given by Ms Holgate to the four staff members in what became a corporate entity in 1989, albeit government-owned. The cash bonuses handed out in other government entities also will rankle, both with the public and those they elect. In the post-COVID recovery phase, when demands on the public purse have never been greater and government debt is rising, accountability for remuneration across the public sector — including the ABC — is fundamental. Taxpayers deserve value for money. The matter of bonuses needs to be examined across government agencies, and consistent, transparent standards set out and followed.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Wrap up or dress up for some great local events EDITORIAL	Bay of Plenty Times	Some of us might be missing the ability to escape winter and fly to warmer climates this year.
I personally love the seasons — and the chance to wrap up or dress up at some fantastic local events.
It’s the Midwinter Mingle at the Whangamata Golf Club on Sunday, August 16, 2pm-5pm. For a bit of music, art and mingling — grab a $20 ticket and mooch the wonderful creativity we have in our community at Whangamata.
There’ll be an extensive exhibition of art, both 2D and 3D, and a line-up of talented musicians: Reuben Fleetwood, who has just signed a contract with Sony (previous Coastal News stories), two other vibrant and talented musicians Morgan Keating Marr and Joel Lester; and a group of wacky ukulele players.
Diary the date of August 29 and in the meantime maybe take a look in your wardrobe to see if you can donate good quality clothes for the Formal Wear Expo at Waihi Community Hall.
This great initiative sells dresses and suits for $30 and shoes for $10, with the intention of helping youngsters and others find something affordable and stylish for the school ball, formal events and interviews.
Donate your “gently used” clothing to Sassie Sadie, Audrey and Flora or Waihi Beach Primary by August 27. All money raised will go to a great local cause.
After a decade of no Waihi Festival, a dedicated group of enthusiastic volunteers are stepping up with the help of Go Waihi.
They’re promising a new and more vibrant event on January 30 and 31, 2021.
The emphasis is on a fun day for all the family.
There’ll be street entertainment, a local art and craft show in the Memorial Hall and something special at the museum and Goldfields Railway planned, and an art exhibition in the Wintec Building.
The festival will take place in the main thoroughfares and all businesses in the CBD are being asked if they’d be prepared to allow promotional items in their window space before the festival.
Please contact Thea Ph 863 8780 or 0274041934 or Jose Ph 863 3302 or 0274570242.

EDITORIAL A lot to play for in choice of venue for rugby test	The Northern Advocate	Some reports suggesting the newly-crowned world champion Springboks could play the All Blacks at Mbombela Stadium in the city formerly known as Nelspruit as part of the Rugby Championship in September have called it an “odd” choice of venue.
The stadium is not an obvious pick. It was built for the 2010 Fifa World Cup — it’s where the All Whites famously drew 1-1 with Italy — and it holds only 41,000 people. It’s not what South Africans would describe as a rugby fortress such as Johannesburg’s Ellis Park or Durban’s Kings Park.
But neither of those two venues hold much fear for the All Blacks, who have lost only one of their last five tests at Ellis Park (a 27-25 defeat in 2014). The All Blacks last played in Durban in 2016 and humbled the Boks 57-15.
The All Blacks’ impressive record in the republic is one of the reasons former coach Steve Hansen was keen to keep the South Africans involved in Super Rugby. In the All Blacks’ case, familiarity doesn’t breed contempt as much as a healthy self confidence. The more you visit a place, the fewer mysteries it holds.
Interestingly, the Boks’ most successful venue for All Blacks tests in recent times is the one now called Sky Sport Stadium in Wellington. They drew 16-16 in last year’s Rugby Championship and, a year before, beat Hansen’s men 36-34 in another cliffhanger. This year they will play their New Zealand test at Eden Park, where they haven’t won since 1937.
Should South African Rugby decide to play in Mbombela, where they have played only three times before (although none in a test of this significance), it would fit neatly into this modern team’s ethos of inclusivity and breaking new ground.
Thousands of fans welcomed the world champions home from Japan after their incredible performance in beating England 32-12 in Yokohama in October (after they lost to the All Blacks in their first pool game). Led superbly by captain Siya Kolisi, the nation’s first black rugby skipper, it is a team for all of the country.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Promoting maths, science is vital but it will take time	The Australian	Some ‘soft option’ courses do not foster jobs and prosperity
Despite bleak job prospects for many young people in the post-pandemic wash-up, the Australian economy faces serious skills shortages, especially in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) sphere. The Morrison government’s push to steer university applicants away from law, humanities, social science and commerce degrees and towards maths, science, agriculture, nursing and teaching courses, through the HECS system, makes sense. But it is hardly a surprise it has had no discernible effect on enrolments for 2021. That is despite the fact some students will face an extra $14,500 a year in costs — $58,000 over four years. That is an increase of up to 113 per cent on previous years.
Education Minister Dan Tehan announced the policy in June, as Years 11 and 12 students were deeply engaged in senior subjects, selected with a view to university education. As Centre for the Study of Higher Education professorial fellow Frank Larkins told Richard Ferguson, students make choices in Years 9 and 10, often with a prerequisite for future courses.
Labor education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek is correct when she says the rise in humanities applications by about 2000 in NSW, Queensland and the ACT will result in thousands of students carrying greater debt. That is a choice they are prepared to live with. As ANU economics professor Bruce Chapman, the architect of the HECS scheme, told The Australian there is no behavioural evidence that pricing shifts make much difference in student preferences. On the upside, the trend will boost university revenue.
Mr Tehan hopes his policy will shift enrolment patterns over time. Whether or not it does, it is reasonable that taxpayer largesse be applied to students undertaking courses in fields in which the nation lacks expertise. This is essential because skilled migration has been slowed to a trickle in the wake of COVID. The good news is that the pandemic appears to have lifted interest in health science courses. While some students’ talents will always make them suited to arts, law and humanities, the shortage of STEM professionals and the fall in the study of hard sciences in Years 11 and 12 suggests the education system has become unbalanced. If the government’s price signal encourages students, parents and teachers to prioritise STEM that will be a good development. Quality maths and science teaching, from primary school onwards, is vital to foster student interest in those subjects and the career opportunities they open up. More attention also needs to be paid to subject selection. In September, Chief Scientist Alan Finkel called on universities to give students clear and consistent advice to take core subjects such as maths, English and sciences in high school. Increasing numbers of students, he said, were entering university underprepared for courses. The signals around core subjects need to be strengthened to help students make informed choices.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Democracies back Hong Kong	The Australian	Speaking out en bloc might limit the chance of further trade reprisals
Through their joint statement, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne and her US, UK and Canadian counterparts have effectively drawn international attention to China’s Communist Party rulers’ suppression of pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong, with the mass arrest last week of 55 leading politicians. The 55 were arbitrarily incarcerated for their roles in a pro-democracy primary election last July. Some 600,000 Hong Kongers voted in the primary, which, though not a formal part of the political process, would have determined who challenged pro-Beijing candidates in the 2020 Legislative Council elections. Fearing humiliation, the CCP “postponed” the Legislative Council elections. The previous year, in November 2019, pro-democracy district council candidates won in a landslide.
The joint statement demonstrated that four of the Five Eyes allies felt compelled to unite to publicly condemn the CCP’s increasingly ruthless oppression in the territory. The statement censured the way “dissent and opposing views are being eliminated” in Hong Kong.
While the statement was signed by outgoing Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, it reflected the strong views of his incoming Biden successor, Antony Blinken. Mr Blinken, in his own statement, spoke of “the sweeping arrests of pro-democracy” leaders as “an assault on those bravely advocating for universal human rights”. He pledged that “the Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing’s crackdown on democracy”.
President-elect Biden, who has vast foreign policy experience after years as vice-president and decades as a senator, has made it clear he will be no less determined than the outgoing US administration in confronting China. His aim, he says, will be to align the policy of Western democracies so they can work together to bring maximum pressure on Beijing. This would be achieved, he wrote in Foreign Policy magazine, through a global “Summit for Democracy” aimed at renewing “the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the free world” and the goal of achieving a consistently multilateral and thereby a more effective approach towards China’s aggression. The joint declaration by Australia, the US, UK and Canada reflects that approach.
The hope must be that Mr Biden and Mr Blinken will be able to coax other democracies, such as India, Japan and Five Eyes partner New Zealand, to join in further efforts in response to Beijing’s rapidly escalating oppressions. New Zealand was not part of the statement made by the four. A NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokeswoman said the country “has serious concerns about the situation in Hong Kong” and on this occasion expressed them independently.
As Peter Jennings, of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said: “The only chance that the world has to shift Beijing’s behaviour is for Beijing to be (made to) see that its actions (are) widely condemned.” The mass arrests leave no doubt about the extent of the oppression being imposed on Hong Kong by the CCP. China must be disabused of any temptation to regard the egregious assault by deranged Trump supporters on the heart of US democracy last week as a sign of any lessening of the democratic world’s determination to oppose anti-democratic oppression. As the foreign ministers’ statement said, the 55 arrests in the former colony show Hong Kong’s National Security Law is being used against democratic dissenters. The statement called for Hong Kong and Chinese authorities “to respect the legally guaranteed rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong without fear of arrest and detention”. It was crucial, the ministers said, “that the postponed Legislative Council elections proceed in a fair way that includes candidates representing a range of political opinions”. That is precisely what China is determined to avoid.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Fire disaster too complex for piecemeal approach	The Australian	Speed and resources are essential to save lives and property
The national bushfire map is an alarming sight. From Western Australia to Queensland, and especially along the continent’s ravaged southeast coastline of NSW and Victoria, blazes are raging in every state. The selfless dedication and herculean work of professional fire crews, generous volunteers, police and other emergency service workers has been little short of miraculous. Without them, the loss of life, devastating as it is, would be far worse. The Australian Defence Force and reservists have been called in. At least 17 people, including three volunteer firefighters, have been killed since the start of this brutal fire season. More people are missing, feared dead.
Holiday-makers have begun to be evacuated from Mallacoota in Victoria after several days and nights on the beach. Fires have burnt through more than 766,000 hectares across Victoria. NSW, which entered an official seven-day state of emergency at 9am on Friday, has seen an area greater than the size of Belgium burned; more than 4 million hectares destroyed and 900 homes lost.
The National Security Committee of cabinet will meet on Monday to discuss the nation’s response. But with more “catastrophic ’’ conditions tipped for the weekend, is that urgent enough? NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons expects conditions on Saturday to be worse than on New Year’s Eve. In East Gippsland, temperatures are expected to climb back into the mid-40s, with emergency crews exhausted.
Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have pledged to do whatever is required to meet state requests for assistance. That is reassuring. Under our Federation, states are in charge of responding to natural disasters. But it means that even in the case of the most severe natural disasters, there is no one leader who is automatically in charge of co-ordinating resources and rescue efforts.
With fires burning across the nation, a brief meeting with the states, convened by the commonwealth, to establish how efforts could be better co-ordinated and whether resources could be shared would make sense. Looking ahead, Mr Morrison, wisely, has already flagged a major rewrite to rules covering hazard reduction, landclearing and where homes can be built. Nor does our system preclude the appointment of an experienced, respected leader with disaster management expertise to take charge and co-ordinate the response on a national basis, under the Australian Government Disaster Response Plan.
The task would require a leader of the calibre of former governor-general Sir Peter Cosgrove, who served as chief of the Defence Force from 2002-2005 after a long military career. In 2006, Sir Peter led the Queensland taskforce responsible for rebuilding communities in the Innisfail region in the state’s north following Cyclone Larry.
Such leadership is needed, and needed urgently. Not because political leaders, fire chiefs and others are falling short, but because the complex challenge needs hands-on co-ordination and a national perspective.
Not unreasonably, the public are wondering why, when holiday-makers were stranded on beaches on Tuesday, it took until Thursday for them to be rescued. Were HMAS Choules, which arrived off the coast of Mallacoota at dawn on Thursday morning, and a second vessel, MV Sycamore, dispatched as early as possible? Are sufficient numbers of waterbombing aircraft available, and are they deployed to maximum advantage? Should more be rushed in from overseas if they are available? A national chief, with the overview of every state, would be well placed to judge.And when the immediate threats have passed, such a leader would also be able to advise on how to best prepare for such catastrophes in future.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Melbourne opens up as new challenges emerge	The Australian	Staff management in Covid hotels remains a key safety issue After six months of near silence, Melbourne Airport is a hive of activity. Jets were to begin roaring along the runway at sunrise, the airport’s long corridors will be busy and departure and arrival boards turning over. Australia’s busiest air route, Sydney to Melbourne, is back in business, lifting Tullamarine from 1 per cent to about 33 per cent capacity. It will be busier again when flights to and from Tasmania resume on Friday. A few days later, hopefully, the Brisbane-Melbourne service will be back — Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk permitting. Melbourne travellers have an extra reason to be upbeat. Scott Morrison and Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews have struck a long-overdue agreement to fund an airport rail link to the CBD in under 30 minutes, leaving every 10 minutes. Work on the project, an ideal use of stimulus funding, will start in 2022 and take seven years. The return of 25 per cent of workers to Melbourne’s CBD and easing of rules for home gatherings, weddings and funerals, restaurants and cafes, pools, gyms, gaming venues and church services are welcome.
That’s the good news. It is testament to Australia’s management of COVID-19 and its fallout when much of the world is overwhelmed by second waves. On Friday, 187,833 Americans contracted the virus, 2015 died and authorities are turning chapels, cafeterias and corridors into makeshift treatment rooms. Europe, India and Brazil are also in dire situations. Britain recorded 22,936 new cases on Friday and 502 deaths. As Australia continues to open up, the problems besetting overseas nations are a reminder that the virus continues to pose a threat. Careful policy strategies will be vital if significant outbreaks are to be avoided.
At this stage, managing the quarantining of Australians arriving from overseas COVID hotspots is one of the main challenges. After Victoria’s quarantining disaster, which led to the deaths of 768 people, and last week’s alarm in South Australia, there is no room for error. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall did the right thing limiting the state’s draconian six-day lockdown early after it emerged it was based on a lie told to contact tracers by a part-time employee at a pizza bar. The man, a 36-year-old Spaniard on a graduate visa, also worked as a kitchen hand at a quarantine hotel. His lie about buying a pizza from the store but not working there created a baseless fear that he may have contracted the virus from a pizza box. Businesses in South Australia are furious, understandably, that the short, sharp lockdown was statewide when the problem was contained to Adelaide. But Mr Marshall was unapologetic in an interview with David Penberthy. The impact on jobs and the economy would have been “absolutely devastating” if a second wave had taken hold, he said. Mr Marshall also dismissed the idea that politicians had abrogated too much authority to unelected police and medical officials. The alternative, he said, was playing out in the US.
Short-lived as it was, the South Australian situation has underlined vulnerabilities that need to be addressed in relation to workers at quarantine hotels. Part-time work in hotels is common, which creates the problem of workers contracting and spreading the highly contagious virus through cross-employment. Close relationships are also a concern. In September, a security guard at a COVID hotel in Melbourne was linked to the spread of the virus to an aged-care centre. She reportedly shared a home with an aged-care worker. ACTU secretary Sally McManus wants security guards in COVID hotels paid more than the award minimum to negate the need for them to hold second jobs. Opposition employment spokesman Brendan O’Connor wants the Morrison government to help fund those workers. In the interests of public health, especially that of vulnerable and older Australians and the national interest, safeguards are needed to minimise the possibility of further outbreaks at COVID hotels being transmitted further afield. Mr Marshall will consider banning hotel quarantine workers from holding second jobs after requesting advice from health experts. Strict hygiene and testing processes are fundamental. Staff, ideally, should be able to work full-time, or sufficient hours to not need other jobs. They must not be allowed to work in aged care. Employers need flexibility in rostering staff. The issue will become more pertinent from December 7 as Victoria accepts 160 overseas arrivals a day. All will be quarantined, testing what has been learned in recent months.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Casual labour shortage a sign of problems to come	The Australian	Stagnant population growth is not in the national interest
The news that the horticulture industry faces a shortage of about 30,000 workers to pick and pack the nation’s fruit and vegetables during the next six months quantifies a serious economic downside of COVID-19 — looming labour shortages in areas of need. On the face of it, this seems like a paradox given the problem of unemployment. But in the first report to put a number on the horticulture industry’s labour shortfall during the pandemic, a study by Ernst & Young for Horticulture Innovation Australia, reported exclusively by Rosie Lewis on Wednesday, highlights the reality.
Farmers and other stakeholders identified international and state border closures and visa restrictions as the main impediments to the recruitment of the casual workers. Cairns and Wide Bay in Queensland, Shepparton and northwest Victoria, Coffs Harbour, Grafton and the Murray region in NSW, and the southeast of South Australia will be among the areas hardest hit. Victoria and Tasmania are facing some of the worst shortages due to their high levels of labour-intensive crops such as table grapes and berries. Farmers are warning of major price hikes and shortages if the problem is not solved.
The labour shortages, in turn, will impede farmers’ ability to invest and spend in their regions. “Australians haven’t shown themselves to be interested in harvest work in general,” one grower told the survey. “I think the economic situation will need to be quite dire before unemployed people in cities have the impetus to look for work in the regions and relocate as needed.” That is despite real unemployment believed to be around 13 per cent, including discouraged jobseekers not actively looking for work because their workplaces are on hold or closed down.
The shortage of pickers and packers is one facet of a wider challenge arising from the pandemic. The nation’s future population will be smaller and older than previously assumed because of the sharp drop under way in net overseas migration, Josh Frydenberg said in a pre-budget speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry last week. With borders closed to foreign tourists and students, and temporary residents leaving our shores, population growth will fall to its lowest level in a century.
It was expected to slow, the Treasurer said, from 154,000 in 2019-20 to 31,000 in 2020-21. Migration eventually would return to the levels the nation was accustomed to, he said. But lost migrants would not be replaced: “And given our migrant workers tend, on average, to be younger, this will lower labour force participation and average hours worked across the economy into the future.” The loss of such a vital growth driver, as Australian Industry Group chief Innes Willox warned after the speech, will pressure companies and governments to lift productivity.
The nub of the problem, as Tom Dusevic wrote last week, is that coronavirus has derailed the “Big Australia” express. In an extraordinary turnaround, more people will be leaving the nation permanently in the next few years than will be arriving from overseas. Given Australia’s ageing population and skills and casual labour shortages, our diminishing size will be problematic for productivity, consumer demand, housing construction and investment, home prices, the residential property rental market and the tax base. The latter is likely to be especially problematic across the long term when set against the need for increasing health and aged-care spending. In 2015, the Treasury’s most recent Intergenerational Report noted rapid growth in the number and proportion of Australians aged 85 and older. It also predicted fewer people of traditional working age, 15 to 64. As a result of the immigration slowdown, Dusevic wrote, Australia’s population growth is expected to drop to 0.6 per cent this financial year, putting us among a group of ageing nations such as Britain, The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Norway. Italy and Japan are shrinking. In the short term, as National Farmers Federation president Tony Mahar says, the EY report should act as a catalyst for state and federal governments to help farmers who need immediate solutions to harvest this year’s crop. Scott Morrison, sensibly, is considering expanding the seasonal worker and Pacific labour programs. Growers will be looking for action in Tuesday’s budget. And, despite the ravages of COVID, the government should resume our robust immigration program as soon as practical, with an emphasis on filling labour and skills shortages. Growing a bigger Australia has always served us well.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Border paranoia risks jobs revival and national unity	The Australian	State closures are killing tourism industry and confidence It’s often said Perth is the most isolated city in the world. But last year Western Australia’s tourism minister declared the perception was “outdated” and asked residents to brag about the state’s appeal. Yet, amid the coronavirus pandemic, Premier Mark McGowan keeps talking down WA’s prospects. “Isolation is Western Australia’s greatest strength. Isolation from the rest of the country, isolation from the rest of the world,” he said, vowing to defend the ramparts from Canberra or the NSW government. This is a fearful man’s perspective; it undersells WA’s virtues and puts citizens and employers in a defensive mindset. Such thinking will keep its economy in suspended animation, relegating WA to slower growth and tens of thousands of people to longer stints of unemployment.
As Australia winds back restrictions in a three-stage process, there will be differences of approach, guided by medical and other advice, balancing competing needs. But the aim is to have a COVID-safe operating environment in place by July, with state borders reopened and possibly a trans-Tasman travel zone. Scott Morrison has been first among equals in national cabinet, conveying consensus decisions and the relative harmony between jurisdictions. Shutting down the economy to flatten the curve of infections was relatively easy compared with the current phase of bespoke reanimation. WA and Queensland, and to a lesser extent South Australia and Tasmania, have become strident on border closures. The Prime Minister correctly called them out on Wednesday, warning that they were hurting the economy and tourism businesses, especially with the looming school holiday season.
As leaders know, closing internal borders was not the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the key medical adviser to national cabinet. That point has been made often by Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy and his deputies. But there are acute sensitivities to new outbreaks of COVID-19. A sheep ship carrying ill crew members was allowed to dock in Fremantle, leading to finger-pointing at Canberra from a riled Mr McGowan. The death of a Queensland man will again raise the political heat over borders — but it shouldn’t. As restrictions are lifted, and people return to school, work, sport and social life, it’s inevitable there will be spikes in case numbers. We are not going to eradicate the virus for some time, if ever.
Our strategy has been to suppress the spread of COVID-19, while building capability to deal with any outbreaks. We’ve succeeded in boosting intensive-care capacity, are broadening testing and have put in place a tracing regime that will help officials track the contacts of infected people. NSW, with Sydney as the gateway for visitors, has been the caseload epicentre. But progress in reducing community transmission is giving officials confidence, as long as there is not complacency on strict social distancing and good hygiene practices. Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant told NSW MPs the state was unlikely to face another major wave of COVID-19 infections this year, with the virus effectively contained and transmission rates reduced to nearly zero. This will underpin the easing of restrictions, allowing NSW to emerge faster from the economic calamity of shutdown.
There is a risk the nation could become a two-speed, even three-speed, economy in recovery. It may even be a matter of choice, due to border closures. WA is exposed to the resources cycle, but still attracts out-of-state tourists. Queensland relies heavily on tourism, especially in winter. As we report on Thursday, states could lose $45bn in revenue and see a 40 per cent spike in debt over the next two years, putting pressure on credit ratings. Queensland could lose $2bn in tourism spending from now to September; it is the most reliant on interstate visitors, accounting for almost half of its market. Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham demands states with closed borders must release their scientific advice and explain why. Senator Birmingham argues it is now clear the lifting of restrictions had not caused a spike in COVID-19 cases. Instead of engaging on the substance of his argument, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk reflexively took a cheap shot at the South Australian. Ms Palaszczuk runs a state with one of the highest rates of people employed in tourism, while South Australia has one of the lowest. “Queensland clearly has the most to lose from any delays to the reopening of domestic tourism,” the Tourism Minister said. We have a national economy, where movement of goods and people should be seamless. As we look for ways to revive and retool our economy out of hibernation, there’s nothing at all splendid about isolation.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Vaccines, not panic, on Covid	The Australian	States must break their addiction to lockdowns and build confidence Business owners and households have every right to feel betrayed by the decision on Monday to put Australia’s third most populous city into lockdown because of a small number of new COVID-19 cases. Hopes that, with the vaccine rollout under way, border closures and lockdowns could be avoided and people could plan their travel and business arrangements with confidence have been dashed. Coming immediately before the Easter holidays, the blow is doubly hard. Coinciding with the end of the federal government’s JobKeeper, the Brisbane lockdown will make business owners and their employees feel less confident and less secure about their future. A three-day lockdown of Greater Brisbane was imposed from 5pm Monday after four new cases were recorded from community transmission. Schools have been shut, masks are mandatory across the state and Brisbane people are able to leave home for only four essential reasons.
Snap lockdowns have been a fashionable strategy for states on the flimsiest excuses. They have been imposed in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland at short notice because of a handful of COVID-19 cases under the pretence of giving authorities time to properly understand new outbreaks. In hindsight, it is doubtful that any have had a meaningful impact on transmission of the virus, certainly not if any cost-benefit analysis had been taken into account. The evidence from Melbourne is that after enduring 111 days of lockdown last year it was a five-day lockdown from February 12 that broke the spirit of the city, from which it is yet to recover. Premiers have said lockdowns have been necessary because of new, more infectious variants of the virus. The lack of community spread of the new variants in Australia shows that this is not necessarily so. Nonetheless, premiers have been quick to trumpet success in keeping their citizens safe, and in Queensland and WA they have been well rewarded for it at the ballot box.
It is Canberra that has been called on to take responsibility for the economic cost of state decisions. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has argued forcefully for the federal government to extend subsidies to travel and hospitality workers affected by the pandemic. But with JobKeeper ended she has been prepared to pull the rug from under business on the eve of one of the busiest trading periods of the year. Ms Palaszczuk argues she is following the advice of her medical experts, but good leadership requires a big-picture view and an ability to make tough decisions. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has shown managing a small outbreak of COVID-19 is possible without resorting to widespread lockdowns. The Brisbane lockdown has already had a cascading affect that will hurt the airline and travel sectors. Other states have been quick to react, with hard borders imposed on Greater Brisbane by WA, Victoria, SA and Tasmania. Restrictions in NSW, logically, apply only to the venues to which COVID-19 cases have been linked. Australia has a lot to celebrate in how it has managed the pandemic. Compared with millions of deaths around the world, Australia has had 29,276 cases and 909 deaths. The last of six COVID-19 deaths in Queensland was in April last year. On Monday, Australia had 154 active cases, mostly acquired overseas. The carriers were well contained in hotel quarantine. Seventy-seven people are in hospital with two, both in Queensland, needing intensive care. Despite the state actions, the financial response from the federal government has kept the economy primed and business confidence is returning. These measures have had a high financial cost. Lockdowns and controls by premiers who have not been paying the bills must stop. With a vaccine available and in production domestically, the best response now is to make sure all vulnerable people are protected. The urgency is not to lock things down but to speed up vaccines so business can be confident it will not be hostage to stop-start decisions from government, and citizens can plan their lives.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Perrottet’s pathway to recovery	The Australian	States’ rising debts and job losses will be major challenges
As Canberra and the states increasingly turn their attention to laying the groundwork for post-pandemic economic recovery, Scott Morrison has made it clear that business, not big government, will be front and centre in the process. New policies, separate from last year’s election agenda, will be needed to maximise growth, as will a more efficient functioning of the federation. The importance of such an approach is evident from the magnitude of the problems confronting individual states, as well as the nation as a whole.
In an interview on Monday with Yoni Bashan, NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet reveals the economy of our largest state is expected to contract by up to 10 per cent over the remainder of this year, according to Treasury modelling. If current social restrictions remain in place until June 30, an additional 220,000 people are expected to be out of work in NSW alone. Dire as the projections are, they would have been far worse had the Morrison government not introduced its $130bn JobKeeper wage subsidy program.
Nationally, as many as 1.9 million to 3.4 million people could be out of work in coming weeks, the Grattan Institute predicts. As Ewin Hannan writes on Monday, the institute believes the JobKeeper wage subsidy will obscure much of the impact of the growing unemployment rate, which was likely to rise to between 10 and 15 per cent.
As in all states, revenue has been flattened in NSW during the pandemic crisis, with taxes, duties, fees, licences and other charges deferred or waived. The situation has been compounded by drought, the summer bushfire season and a property market that is likely to lurch over the next 18 months. In considering how to recoup lost income, Mr Perrottet is looking at the possibility of selling state assets, such as WestConnex, or borrowing money while interest rates remain low. NSW, which has practised fiscal restraint on recurrent spending while investing heavily in infrastructure in recent years, is better placed than most states to take on additional debt. NSW has a long-term growth average of 2.5 per cent a year. The willingness of successive Coalition governments for leasing or selling public assets and using the proceeds to fund growth infrastructure and repay debt is standing the state in good stead.
Queensland’s cash-strapped Palaszczuk government, in contrast, is ideologically opposed to privatisation in any form — an irrational position, unfortunately, that is shared by the LNP opposition. Queensland is also likely to be forced to increase its heavy debt burden to pay for its response to the COVID-19 crisis, as Sarah Elks reports on Monday. Total government debt in the state was already forecast to reach $91.8bn by 2022-23, before the pandemic hit. And Treasurer Jackie Trad has promised a $4bn economic stimulus package.
In Victoria, the Andrews government announced last week that it would borrow up to $24.5bn in emergency funding to help address the economic fallout of COVID-19. That would see Victoria’s debt increase to more than $70bn next financial year, up from less than $23bn in 2018-19.Mr Perrottet’s insights into how NSW is weathering the pandemic is an indication of the challenges facing all states. Unemployment in NSW, currently 4.8 per cent compared with a national rate of 5.2 per cent, is likely to rise to between 7 and 10 per cent. It is important, as Mr Perrottet said, to get as many businesses as possible up and running while maintaining social distancing by limiting customer numbers at any one time. In the longer term, his calls for tax reform and deregulation need to be taken on board and discussed by the state and federal governments, with the national cabinet providing a useful opportunity to work across political lines.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Gloom is infectious, so is hope	The Australian	Stay positive, while planning for mental health to take a hit Loneliness and anxiety about health figure prominently in a snapshot survey of these pandemic times reported in The Australian on Tuesday. Many readers will recognise themselves in those results. We also have been warned to expect an increase in suicides. The mental health impact is potentially serious and the national cabinet sensibly has endorsed a plan to try to minimise the harm. Christine Morgan, suicide prevention adviser to Scott Morrison, was asked on Friday about the risk of people ending their own lives and said this was “absolutely an issue”. But she also made the point that the way we talk about suicide risk “needs to be very carefully managed … to actually concentrate on what can we do to ensure it doesn’t happen”. She mentioned a crucial watchword: hope.
We have to get the balance right. Of course we should encourage people to safeguard their own mental health and look out for others. But the message must not spill over into creating the impression that the pandemic is so catastrophic that a loss of hope is logical, that there is only one way out.
The world is in the throes of a profound experience, with some shared elements and some that differ according to a host of factors from governance and culture to personal circumstances and temperament. It’s foolhardy to make black-and-white predictions about what the effects will be. There is no doubt that joblessness and social dislocation have the potential to blight many lives. But with tenacity and luck it’s possible for people to find new sources of productive work. And we should remember that happiness is not simply monetised. Above a certain level of income, gains in satisfaction fall away.
In the struggle against COVID-19, there is also the possibility of a London Blitz-like effect: a life-and-death challenge faced together can bring a sense of solidarity and purpose that enables people to put aside what only yesterday might have seemed overwhelming personal worries and troubles. There are plentiful stories of people being less preoccupied with themselves and instead reaching out to help others.
Japan has just witnessed the most dramatic year-on-year fall in suicides in five years — down almost 20 per cent last month compared with April last year. That culture is well known for a devotion to corporate life that can seem all-consuming, and not only to outsiders. Now, Japanese families have a rare opportunity to enjoy their own company away from office pressures or school bullying. At least that’s one possible explanation for less suicide floated in the Japanese media; another is the social solidarity stimulated in the face of disaster. True, it’s early days in the economic cost likely to be exacted by the pandemic, and solidarity may wilt in time. In Australia, Ms Morgan said there were figures from some states suggesting suicide rates had not risen, but she also warned we should not be complacent ahead of future risks. We simply do not know how many jobs are gone, never to return, or how many livelihoods are yet to be lost. The young seem especially vulnerable, and not just because they may be entering the workforce in bleak economic times, have less marketable skills or may be more dependent on vanishing hospitality jobs. Across the Anglosphere there are signs of heightened levels of mental distress and fragility among the young, notably since the rise of social media. They are surrounded by well-intentioned programs and rules to promote “wellbeing” and shield them from risks. Yet it may be that the “resilience” talked up by this same culture will remain elusive without serious challenges, even hardship. It’s no coincidence that great literature and myth have a healthy dose of suffering and ordeal. How the young respond to the world of COVID-19 — indeed, how we all respond — will depend partly on the meaning that can be fashioned from the experience. Policymakers will and should do everything possible to rebuild the economy. But it’s up to us to give purpose to reinvented livelihoods or reconfigured work and family relationships. A pandemic is a threat to what we value, but it is also a stimulus to a defence and reconstruction of what makes life worthwhile. With our help, hope can be stronger than despair.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Northern Australia white paper is worth revisiting	The Australian	Strategic issues are more pressing now than five years ago
In June 2015 the Abbott government released Our North, Our Future: White Paper on Developing Northern Australia. The ambitious 20-year plan envisaged millions more people living and working in northern Australia, seizing opportunities for greater integration with the booming economies of Asia, especially China. New and upgraded transport and water infrastructure would open up land for agriculture. Development, easier access for foreign workers and population growth would be key.
“We need to lay the foundations for rapid population growth and put the north on a trajectory to reach a population of four to five million by 2060,” the white paper said. Cities flagged for growth included Darwin, Townsville, Cairns, Rockhampton, Mackay, Broome and Karratha. We are still in the early stages of the plan, however progress towards these goals has been frustratingly slow. The centres identified have grown, but not at the rate predicted. And while 38 of the plan’s 51 recommendations have been implemented, the development of water infrastructure has also been too slow. The fertile north receives 60 per cent of the nation’s rainfall but only 2 per cent is captured. Because it is almost immune from drought, its potential to become an enormous food bowl, with proximity to Asian markets, needs to be better developed. Red and green tape, the main barriers to progress, must be dealt with.
What has changed since the 2015 report is the strategic outlook of the Asia-Pacific region, including Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. While China is Australia’s largest trading partner, our nation should not, as Northern Australia Minister Matt Canavan says, “hitch our star to one country”. Doing so elevates risk, from a political and economic perspective. In this light, the Morrison government’s drive to develop closer ties with India and other Asian and Pacific nations is a sensible priority.
Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and a former deputy secretary for strategy in the Defence Department, agrees. Writing on Monday, Mr Jennings argues: “It has been painfully obvious for years that our major ally, the US, major regional partner, Japan, and our major market, China, all see more strategic value in northern Australia than successive federal governments and much of our Defence establishment.’’ At a time when the US has been trying to reduce overseas military commitments — including in the Middle East — the rotational deployments of US Marine Corps troops to the Top End, now in its ninth year, affirms its judgment that northern Australia is increasingly important to Asia’s security, he writes.
Four months after the release of the white paper in 2015, the Northern Territory leased the port of Darwin to a Chinese company with alleged links to the communist government. In today’s environment, such a lease would not happen. The move prompted Canberra to swiftly tighten foreign investment rules on similar transactions. The lease angered the US, and Chinese media now brazenly describes the port as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. It is nothing of the sort.In light of developments since 2015, the northern Australia plan is even more important to Australia’s future. As the government works to refine it, strengthening the Australian Defence Force’s role in the region should be an issue on the table.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Meri Kirihimete from the Press team	Wanganui Chronicle	Stratford Press editor Ilona Hanne wishes all our readers a wonderful Christmas and happy new year.
As we reach the end of what has unquestionably been a year we will all remember long into the future, Alyssa and I have been taking a look back at what made the news this year in our paper.
While the world and national news have of course been dominated by words such as lockdown, pivot, Zoom, unprecedented and other Covid-19-related buzzwords, it is heartening to be able to flick through the pages of our papers over this past year and find other words stand out. Community, generosity, support, kindness, help, volunteers ... these are the words that define the stories of Stratford this year, and I think that’s because these words are at the heart of our community ethos here in the heart of Taranaki.
Despite all the many challenges 2020 has thrown at us, our community has stood strong and kept the good news flowing.
While we couldn’t resist making our front page a visual reminder of the year that face masks became the most popular accessory since Madonna made fingerless lace gloves a sell-out item in the 80s, we hope our look back over all the good news we have covered this year reminds all of us how lucky we are to be living here in Stratford this year.
I hope this edition of the Stratford Press reminds you of the positives we had this year, and the great people we have in our community who have ensured that 2020 and Covid-19 might have stopped many things, but they didn’t stop our community from supporting each other, helping those in need and achieving great things.
Alyssa and I wish you all the best of the season and we look forward to continuing to celebrate your stories and your news with you in the new year.

Expand strategic, trade alliances	The Australian	Stronger ties between democratic nations will promote stability Like Joe Biden in the US, Boris Johnson is demonstrating his commitment to multilateral strategic priorities. Post-Brexit, the British Prime Minister wants his nation to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, commonly known as the TPP-11, the 11-nation Pacific Rim free-trade bloc known originally as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Australia played a crucial role in establishing. He also has signalled his determination to expand the June summit of G7 nations in Cornwall into a “D10 of the world’s leading democracies” aimed at countering Chinese expansionism. Australia, India and South Korea would join the group alongside G7 members the US, the UK, Japan, France, Germany, Canada and Italy. With Britain sending its biggest flotilla of warships to Asia in a generation, Mr Johnson also has raised the prospect of joining the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the “Asian NATO”, that groups the US, Australia, India and Japan in an increasingly important regional security alliance focused on Chinese regional militarism.
At any time, Mr Johnson’s moves “to show UK global leadership post-Brexit” would be significant. At a time when the new US President has indicated his commitment to a similar strategy, their approaches indicate how quickly some things have changed since Donald Trump left the White House. Gone, thankfully, is Mr Trump’s recurring attempt to inveigle his anti-democratic friend, Vladimir Putin, back into the G7. And in one of his first acts as president, Mr Trump short-sightedly withdrew the US from the TPP. Like Mr Johnson in his search for post-Brexit trading partners, Mr Biden recognises the value of a vast trading bloc with 500 million consumers that is crucial to countering China’s growing regional economic muscle.
Mr Biden is strongly supportive, too, of Mr Johnson’s drive to remake the G7 as a coalition of democratic nations. The US President’s newly appointed “Asia tsar”, Assistant Secretary of State for Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell, has welcomed the D10 proposal and potential expansion of the Quad. Such moves, he said, would send a powerful message “that there are risks to China’s present course”.
Achieving those aims, Mr Campbell acknowledges, is likely to be “among the most challenging in the recent history of American statecraft”. That would require solid backing from the other nations involved. France and Italy, for example, are unhappy about Mr Johnson’s plan to use the Cornwall summit to place a reformed G7 in the vanguard of countering Chinese expansionism. They should not be. Mr Johnson has shown foresight about issues that should concern all democracies. Mr Trump showed strength in confronting China over trade. But what is needed now, as Mr Biden said, is a broadbased alliance of democracies capable of confronting and dealing with Chinese expansionism. That is especially the case amid rising tensions over Taiwan, with Beijing warning any attempt to declare its independence “will mean war”. Mr Johnson is right to see the advantages for Britain in a much closer trade relationship with our region. EU leaders should stop carping and recognise their own interests lie in following Mr Johnson’s strategic lead.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Branch stacks and hit jobs core business inside Labor	The Australian	Structural defects lead to crises of belief and competence
In this time of toppled monuments and liberal democracy under strain, it’s apt to revisit political icons for perspective. In Barton, in inner Canberra, there’s a sculpture of Labor’s John Curtin and Ben Chifley. It’s based on a 1945 photograph of the then prime minister and his treasurer strolling to work at the Old Parliament House. When the public art was unveiled in 2011, former prime minister Julia Gillard spoke of a “humane and humble tribute” to two great patriots, one a radical journalist from the west, the other a railway engine driver from Bathurst. In that era, budding MPs did the rounds of union halls and mass meetings to “credential” themselves to the rank and file in the hope of winning party preselection. Labor had 150,000 members in the 1930s, but dropped to half of that by the 50s split. As Troy Bramston revealed, ALP membership stood at 53,550 at the end of 2017. But who can really tell?
The cataclysm in the Victorian ALP is at once spectacular — explosive texts, secret cameras, national intervention — and painfully familiar and banal. Premier Daniel Andrews sacked right-wing factional powerbroker Adem Somyurek amid allegations he had engaged in systematic branch stacking and used abusive, sexist language and homophobic slurs. Two other ministers resigned over allegations that they, too, were involved in branch stacking. Mr Andrews now says the problem “is unacceptable to me, unacceptable to all decent, hardworking rank-and-file members of our party and affiliate trade unions”. The Premier appears to relish crisis mode. Yet the scandal has shored up his position in the Byzantine tangle of factions, deals and enmities that, aside from Australian rules football’s tribalism, is the state’s blood sport.
Parties have used so-called “ethnic branch stacking”, across the nation, to bolster branch numbers in quick time. It goes on ceaselessly, even though it is against party rules. Why? First and foremost, it’s relatively cheap and very effective. Second, it’s tolerated to an extent. The sting that ensnared Mr Somyurek has set off a dozen theories about who and why, and what the long game may be. Game is the operative word. ALP preferment and patronage rewards those who put time and effort into the dark arts. It must be said most senior Labor figures cut their teeth in these shenanigans. The career path through unions and political offices attracts those skilled in gathering hard numbers, by foul means or fair. Serially underemployed staffers, warehoused in MPs’ offices, spend most of their time in these off-the-books endeavours of factional warfare and mischief in party branches. The ultimate prize for these bit players is to vault into a safe seat in state or federal parliament.
Little wonder so many MPs are underprepared for the real world of policymaking and arguing their case. Sure it was a long time ago, but Curtin and Chifley were schooled in the rough and tumble of manifest differences of belief and core values around wealth creation, fairness and social progress. The professionalisation of Labor politics, if that is what we can call it, has not only neutered passion for lasting change, it has seen a post-materialist shift to identity politics and niche cultural issues. It’s not surprising that ALP membership has plummeted as it obsesses over ideological battles with the green left. Labor can’t win this war and aspire to be a party of government.
Deep organisational defects — of union influence, narrow membership, lack of talent, confused beliefs — were exposed by Labor renegade Mark Latham in his tell-all Diaries in 2005. But they were spectacularly brought to the fore two years later when Kevin Rudd came to power. Next week marks the 10th anniversary of the coup, engineered below deck, which saw Ms Gillard become prime minister. It was an erratic, bloody and bitter two terms for Labor. As chronicled by Paul Kelly in Triumph and Demise, Labor’s “institutional malaise” infected the policies of the Rudd-Gillard show, as it handed power back to unions at the workplace, ditched the successful Hawke-Keating economic model and looked to “reassert state power”. The end point of policy and values decay was Bill Shorten’s dismal offering last election of class-war economics, social engineering and climate dogma. That’s the real damage from branch stacking, factional hits and careerism; it also pervades conservative politics, a discussion for another day. This internal tunnel vision is a huge turn-off for voters, at the very least, and perverts the democratic process. Such flaws of belief and structure always come home to roost in government, as occurred during Labor’s last stint in Canberra. In Victoria, we see risky adventures in bespoke social causes, virtually from end to end. Not all of this agenda is woke prancing, as Mr Andrews’s dalliance with Beijing’s perilous Belt and Road Initiative confirms. ALP stalwarts Steve Bracks and Jenny Macklin might be able to steady the ship until the new year, perhaps get rid of some stinky bilge water. But the real problems are structural and intensely personal. Unlike “humane and humble” nation builders Curtin and Chifley, today’s standard bearers and engine drivers are simply masters of the backroom dark and sly, sharp cleaver.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Hard drug problems exposed	The Australian	Substance abuse is sending more people out of their minds
The health and justice systems, governments and families have good reason to step up the important fight against illicit drugs. New figures from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission reveal Australians’ soaring use of methyl­amphetamine (including ice or crystal meth), cocaine, MDMA and heroin. Spending on the substances has soared by $2bn a year to $11.3bn, David Murray reported on Tuesday. Such drugs are destructive, potentially deadly and closely tied to organised crime. The most alarming revelation in the ACIC report was the steep rise in the use of methyl­amphetamine, a potent central nervous system stimulant that is lethally addictive. It accounted for 76 per cent of the money spent. Addicts are prone to serious physical and mental health problems. It is also associated with violent criminal offending.
The report, based on expert analysis of wastewater, showed the problems are nationwide. Consumption of meth, which is injected, swallowed, smoked or snorted, has jumped by 92.5 per cent in Tasmania in three years. Over the same period, its use was up 75.9 per cent in Queensland, 53.2 per cent in Victoria, 48.7 per cent in the ACT and 29.5 per cent in the Northern Territory. Despite slight drops in consumption, Western Australia and South Australia remain the nation’s meth capitals. Victorians consumed almost half the nation’s heroin in 2018-19. NSW dominated the cocaine market, but usage soared in every state. Queenslanders’ use of MDMA, or ecstasy, a so-called party drug, soared by 132.1 per cent.
The billions of dollars squandered on illicit drugs generate profits for the sole benefit of organised crime groups, ACIC chief executive ­Michael Phelan wrote. The drugs had “a devastating impact on everyday Australians’’.
There are no easy answers. On the supply side, law-enforcement agencies seized almost a third of the heroin needed to meet national demand in 2017-18. They also seized about half the cocaine and meth to meet national demand and about double the MDMA, suggesting dealers stockpile supplies. The problem is international. A year ago, Murray reported that the success of Australian Federal Police in disrupting ice manufacturers and traffickers in China had meant a shift by suppliers to Myanmar. Outlawed motorcycle gangs with links to overseas drug syndicates also remain a serious threat, through amphetamine production and drug-trafficking.
On the demand side, illicit drugs linked to psychosis and mental health problems, especially among young people, must be discouraged. That includes cannabis, which the ACT foolishly legalised last year. The most harmful drugs, such as meth, are also major drivers of family violence, attacks on strangers and robberies.Users seeking help need more support. Last month, the NSW special commission of inquiry into crystal meth said that between 200,000 and 500,000 people nationwide sought treatment for alcohol and drug abuse each year, but most did not receive it. The commission, controversially, recommended the decriminalisation of illicit drugs. The Berejiklian government will respond later this year. But, wisely, it has ruled out contentious proposals such as expanding medically supervised injecting clinics and pill testing at music festivals. Leniency based on groupthink is no solution to an extensive and growing drug scourge.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Trump’s historic rapprochement	The Australian	Sudan and Israel have taken a major step towards peace
Win or lose next week, Donald Trump deserves credit for the historic rapprochement that has led to yet another Arab state abandoning decades of support for terrorism and normalising relations with Israel. Between 1991 and 1996, Sudan, an impoverished North African nation of 41 million people, was Osama bin Laden’s home and al-Qa’ida’s main global operational base. It was also used by Iran as its principal pipeline to channel deadly weapons to Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists attacking Israel.
Yet on Friday, under new rulers trying to lead the country to democracy, it became the third Arab nation in recent weeks, after the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, to formally renounce terrorism and agree to peace with the Jewish state. In doing so, it aligned itself with earlier peace deals concluded between Israel and Egypt in 1979 and with Jordan in 1994.
Mr Trump says another five formerly hostile Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, are about to conclude similar treaties. There may be even more in what is a massive strategic blow to the misguided presumption that there could never be any normalisation of relations with Israel before the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. “HUGE win today for the US and for peace in the world,” Mr Trump tweeted as he announced the Sudan deal while on the phone to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Given Sudan’s impoverishment and its eagerness to grab whatever incentives were offered by Israel, it may not be quite that.
The headway Mr Trump has made in the Arab world by brokering deals that have steadily increased the number of states to have concluded peace accords with Israel reflects the President’s foreign policy realism. He was prepared to disregard other policymakers’ longstanding notion that a deal over Palestinian statehood had to take precedence over bilateral peace arrangements. Such realism also gives lie to the Obama administration’s belief that a pro-Israel foreign policy would inflame the Arab world, and that progress towards peace depended on buttering up the oppressive, terrorist-supporting regime in Iran.
Arab states undoubtedly still care about the Palestinian cause. But, while enraged Palestinian leaders have denounced the moves towards rapprochement with Israel, even they admit that withholding recognition from the Jewish state has yielded little progress on Palestinian statehood. The sterility of obdurate Palestinian attitudes has been evident in recent days. In May, the PLO refused to accept tonnes of desperately needed medical equipment, including ventilators, sent to it by the UAE via Tel Aviv. Last week, PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat, 65, one of Israel’s most malevolent critics, was diagnosed with COVID-19. Without adequate medical facilities in the Palestinian territories, he was rushed from Jericho to Jerusalem’s Hadassah Medical Centre. There, he is on a ventilator, fighting for his life, and being treated by Israeli doctors. Mr Erekat’s battle shows the futility of old Palestinian preconceptions about the need for Arab states to isolate Israel. The process of realistic rapprochement brokered by Mr Trump has broken a logjam that has bedevilled Middle East peace hopes for too long. The US poll will not be decided on foreign policy. But the winner will be assisted by Mr Trump’s progress in the region.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
COMMENT Cases expose heartless ministry	Wanganui Chronicle	Surely one of the most compelling things we’ve seen this week is the court decision around Oliver Christiansen.
He travelled halfway around the world to see his dying father. He wasn’t allowed to, until a court overruled the cartel currently running this country. We have 24 cases, no exemptions.
The beauty of the court decision was it was able to do what so many of us haven’t: truly hold this lot to account. They were made to act, to change their minds, and made to review their procedures. It’ll be fascinating to see once they do that, just how much their approach will change. How many of those 24 originally turned down would have, or will have, the chance to do what they were initially denied?
It brings into sharp focus Winston Peters’ comments of last week, the advice from the Ministry of Health to lock New Zealanders out of New Zealand. It shows a blind obsession with health outcomes and literally nothing else. As we told you at the time, the advice, although free and fair and the sort of thing departments do all the time, was never, could never be acted upon because of immigration law and a United Nations Convention we’ve signed up to, making it illegal to leave people stateless.
This, of course, is of no concern to the ministry. But are we not in seeing this advice and witnessing their actions around the 24 cases, a department that has basically hijacked this whole mess, and turned it into their own experiment?
And it’s endorsed, tragically, by a prime minister short on real world experience. She’s so desperate for a safe harbour of perceived wisdom and experience, and as a result a convert to what is turning out to be an economic catastrophe, masquerading as a health victory.
Ashley Bloomfield, the man responsible for the approach as director general of health, is answerable to really no one, so has got away with it, given his calm demeanour and good general knowledge. But he’s been badly exposed by a court who has seen what most of us could see, but didn’t have the judicial authority to fix.
What makes this really ugly is we have a prime minister who has coated herself with the varnish of humanity. Being kind is what she is, and what she does. But having told us 18 of the 24 cases had been given exemptions, she was embarrassingly and yet again, let down by the ministry when it turned out the reality wasn’t 18, it was zero.
The woman who put teddies in windows and made the tooth fairy an essential worker, stands beside and behind a ministry that turns out to be heartless, cold and driven by little more than statistics.

A crime that makes us recoil	The Australian	Survivors of Tarrant’s massacre have been courageous
Australia’s most shameful and shameless expatriate, Grafton-born terrorist Brenton Tarrant, 29, has received the toughest punishment in the New Zealand justice system — life in prison without parole. A rampant exhibitionist who live-streamed his 17-minute rampage on his Facebook page, from where it was shared across the internet, he will die in obscurity. But the punishment pales alongside the suffering of those who will always love and grieve for the 51 worshippers — defenceless men, women and children — shot dead by Tarrant in a massacre at two Christchurch mosques during Friday prayers on March 15 last year. He also injured 49 people. Those left behind have shown “extraordinary resilience”, as Justice Cameron Mander said. Tarrant murdered some of his victims as they lay wounded, pleading for mercy. His actions, as the judge said, were “beyond callous”; they were “inhuman”.
Scott Morrison spoke for Australians on Thursday when he paid tribute to the Muslim communities on both sides of the Tasman Sea. They have supported each other since that fateful day, reflecting the goodness of faith. “You have been a light answering the darkness,” Mr Morrison said. And New Zealand is family. Our two nations are fierce but good-natured sporting rivals. Our deepest relationship was forged on a blood-soaked peninsula at Gallipoli in 1915. Since then, any atrocity inflicted on our Anzac cousins is a wound inflicted on Australia. That one of our citizens perpetrated this appalling act of terror makes us recoil in revulsion. So did Tarrant’s apparent lack of remorse.
While driven by primeval brutality and warped ideology, Tarrant’s killing spree was also a crime of the cyber age. It makes sense that wide-ranging cyber security measures announced by the Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton earlier this month will assist security services and law enforcement agencies in pursuing other fanatics, similar to Tarrant, who congregate in the recesses of the dark web, where rancid ideologies thrive and terrorist attacks are sometimes plotted. In Tarrant’s case, as crown prosecutor Mark Zarifeh said in court, the atrocity was motivated by an entrenched racist and xenophobic ideology. Investigations by The Australian after the massacre revealed a dark online world of vile ideas, in which extremists do not have to join an organisation, meet each other or sit at the feet of a leader. Like Tarrant, they trawl the internet, and mix and match their beliefs. Censoring the internet is a tricky area for liberal democracies that value free speech. But time and again regulators and policing authorities have discovered red flags that should help to prevent extremist acts. The trauma of March 15 last year is not easily healed, as New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says. But Tarrant’s sentencing marks the end of another difficult stage in the lives of those whose families he tore apart.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Vaccine for all, rich and poor	The Australian	Swift herd immunity is the best medicine for global economy Scott Morrison was right on Sunday to pledge strong Australian backing for Group of 20 efforts to ensure the fair and equitable rollout of COVID-19 vaccines across the world. The pandemic’s horrifying scourge, with global infections surging towards 59 million and deaths approaching 1.4 million, leaves no doubt about the importance of the World Health Organisation’s warning, echoed widely at the G20’s virtual summit hosted by Saudi Arabia, that “no one will be safe until we are all safe”. This is a crucial test for effective and co-ordinated international co-operation.
The urgent need, as Mr Morrison emphasised to the G20 summit and last Friday’s Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit, is to ensure no country, however poor, is left behind. Developed and developing nations, he insisted, must all be assured of early access to safe vaccines. Otherwise, the pandemic will be prolonged with ongoing dire consequences for the global economic recovery.
As the forum of the world’s biggest economies, the G20 has a crucial role to play in seeing that even small nations with weak health infrastructure and economies severely battered by the pandemic get adequate vaccine supplies. The summit’s pledge of an additional $4.5bn to plug a gap in funding for vaccine development should go some way towards ensuring the sort of equitable global rollout Mr Morrison envisions.
But there is a long way to go. Hopefully, the Prime Minister’s appeal to fellow G20 members to follow Australia and increase their contributions to COVAX, the global vaccine access facility, which estimates it will need to provide two billion doses by the end of next year, will not fall on deaf ears. COVAX has been hampered, however, by the failure of big economies such as the US and China to sign up and support it. It is no surprise, as outgoing US President Donald Trump has made clear, that some countries that have funded vaccine research want priority access to doses that pharmaceutical companies are now manufacturing. But they will be shortsighted if they fail to help ensure the global availability of a vaccine. At the G20 summit, Mr Trump conspicuously absented himself from the pandemic discussion. He played golf instead. It is a pity he did so, not only because of the way COVID-19 is raging through the US, one of the most badly affected countries in the world, but also because this is clearly no time for narrow-minded nationalism in dealing with the virus. An immediate issue for president-elect Joe Biden will be to decide whether to end Mr Trump’s boycott and get the US, with its vast resources, back into COVAX and the global battle. It is imperative Mr Biden does so. As Mr Morrison told the summit, there is a pathway out of the pandemic and it lies in the widest possible distribution of a safe and effective vaccine to rich and poor countries alike.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Letter from the editor	The New Zealand Herald	THE ENTERTAINMENT industry is among those hardest hit by Covid-19. Many gigs, shows and other events had been postponed or cancelled even before the Government announced mandatory self-isolation for arriving international travellers and a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people. Across the world, many big cinema releases have been pushed back; work on the Auckland-based Lord of the Rings TV series is on hold. We know there will be a significant number of New Zealand artists, businesses and other professionals doing it very tough right now. Although cinemas remain open, most of the entertainment we consume in the coming weeks will be at home — telly, music, podcasts, games and more. None of us know how long this will last but I reckon there’s rarely been a bigger need for things to distract us from the uncertain times. Today’s TimeOut reflects that. Gone are most of our regular features, replaced with our tips for home entertainment. None of it will solve this situation but it should provide some comfort as we get through it.

The view from America	The Australian	THE LIST - AUSTRALIA'S TOP 100 FINANCIAL ADVISERS At last, it’s clients to the fore in the US financial advice sector The Australian wealth management industry differs in many ways from that of the US, but the two countries hold in common a single, urgent mission: improving consumer access to informed, unconflicted financial guidance.
Barron’s magazine, which in partnership with The Australian created this fourth annual ranking of Australian financial advisers, has tracked and rated America’s best advisers for 17 years. For most of that time, American financial advice has exhibited a split personality, with one part of the industry compelled by law to put their clients’ needs first and another part required only to place clients in “suitable” investments.
This imperfect situation is well on its way to changing.
As in Australia, a strong regulatory push in the US is altering the way financial advice is delivered. Regulation BI, for “best interest”, is wending its way through legal challenges that could delay its implementation at the end of this month. Regardless of when it is formally enacted, the rule already has had the effect of snapping clients and advisers to attention on the matter of best interest.
In short, Americans are awakening to an incredulous and legitimate question: “You mean all financial advisers have NOT been required to act in my best interest?” With that genie out of the bottle, the industry has begun what many believe to be an inexorable march towards more client-centric service by advisers. The most obvious manifestation of this movement will be more advisers using investments that are not just suitable to a client’s risk appetite but that also exhibit the best combination of quality and price.
Even as the specifics of Reg BI’s future remain cloudy, other forces will compel change among financial advisers. Primary among them is a rising tide of educated consumers who require of their advisers a high level of service and integrity. Unsurprisingly, this same dynamic is also playing out in Australia.
“Financial services in the US and Australia have one primary similarity: advisers being challenged and regulated to act in the best interest of their clients,” says Ray Sclafani, founder and chief executive of ClientWise, a US consulting company that provides coaching services in the US and Australia. “New fiduciary standards are forcing every adviser to become more transparent and clear about their value proposition, their fees and the deliverables their clients expect to receive.” The characteristics of a good advisory practice are more or less universal, says Sclafani. Here are some of the most important ones to look for when establishing a new relationship with a financial adviser:
NO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Ask your adviser to disclose and describe any income streams that come from ­sources other than serving advisory clients. Ask for details about how any of those might affect fees charged to you or decisions made on your investments.
A STRUCTURE BUILT TO LAST The best advisers work in teams, and the best teams tend to be demographically and generationally diverse. The goal is to find an adviser “committed to building an enduring firm, designed to serve clients multi-generationally”, says Sclafani. Ask the adviser about a succession plan — who would take the reins if they could no longer run the business? Also ask about the roles various team members play and how decisions are made. Ideally team members have complementary skills that can bring alternative perspectives to the decisions affecting clients and their investments.
A CLEAR VALUE PROPOSITION A good adviser should be able to articulate what will be delivered in exchange for what fee and why the cost is justified. Ask for specifics about their compensation structure and about measures of success and the value you should expect to receive.
“Advisers committed to full transparency, comprehensive planning and serving clients for a lifetime are the ones acting in your very best interest,” says Sclafani.
The good news for consumers in the US and Australia is that financial advisers are under increasing pressure to serve clients better. It’s a trend that many regard as too long in the making in both countries, but now that it’s in full swing, consumers have more power than ever to find good financial guidance.

PM open to meeting Xi, but without conditions	The Australian	Talk, trade with China if possible; but sovereignty is non-negotiable It is eminently reasonable, as Scott Morrison says on Monday, that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping should meet, providing there are no conditions for restarting dialogue. The Prime Minister is willing to work through problems in the relationship, he said, in an excusive interview with Greg Brown. But Mr Morrison is correct to insist on standing by Australia’s sovereign interests. Beijing’s global outlook, as he said, has become “more inconsistent” with Australia’s interests.
The deterioration in our relationship with Beijing over the past year has seen Australian coal, barley, beef, lobster, wine and wood exports targeted with tariffs, bans and long delays at Chinese ports. And as China’s power supply struggles due to a shortage of quality coal during a cold winter, it is in the interests of both nations to reboot the relationship. The government is “always open’’ to meet the Chinese leadership, Mr Morrison made clear. But not if the meeting came with preconditions, including China’s dossier of its 14 perceived grievances about Australia that it released last year. These included negative media coverage of China, foreign investment decisions, foreign interference reforms and critical commentary on the Chinese Communist Party by Coalition MPs. China also voiced fury about Australia’s early call for a probe into the origins of coronavirus in Wuhan.
The advent of a new administration in Washington would make this a good time for a fresh start in Australia’s relationship with China. Writing on Monday, Foreign Minister Marise Payne says the US has entered a period of overt competition with China that will endure through changes in administration. But, she says, the fact two of President Joe Biden’s key appointments to the National Security Council — Jake Sullivan and Kurt Campbell — wrote a blueprint in late 2019 for what they called “competition without catastrophe”, portends “a constructive and intelligent approach’’. Australia, as Senator Payne says, will benefit in the long term if there is a network of nations, with the US as a leading participant, that consistently and with strategic sagacity makes clear what constitutes legitimate behaviour under a rules-based system, even one that is evolving to take account of the interests of rising powers: “We will support adherence to international rules and norms, promote transparency and stand against malicious behaviour such as economic coercion, human rights abuses or the use of disinformation.’’ Taiwan’s ties with the Biden administration are off to a good start after the island’s de facto ambassador to the US attended an inauguration for the first time with an official invitation.
In Australia, one major area of concern, as we reported last week, is the Chinese Communist Party’s recruitment of more than 300 scientists and scholars at Australian tertiary and government research institutions. In a submission to a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security inquiry, China ­expert Alex Joske warned that Beijing’s secretive recruitment programs could ­obtain backdoor access to sensitive technology and lucrative ­innovations. In August, The Australian revealed dozens of researchers had been recruited as part of Beijing’s Thousand Talents Plan, which ­offers them lucrative salaries and perks but insists their ­inventions be patented in China and obliges them to abide by Chinese law. But Mr Joske estimated the Thousand Talents Plan represented only about a third of the cases he has identified. Examples of talent recruitment were evident at all top universities, he said. Monash University had 35 participants, UQ 31 and UNSW 27. The inquiry will report to Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton by July. As Mr Morrison says, Australia’s relationship with China has been on a “slow turn’’ for years. It had not changed because of a single issue. Last year, Beijing refused to take phone calls from or meet Australian government ministers. At that time, business groups called on the government to repair the relationship with China. But Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox is correct in urging Australian companies to resist bullying from Beijing and focus on finding alternative export markets. “What would we give up to meet China’s so-called 14 grievances?’’ Mr Willox wrote last week. “Our press freedom? Our ability to drive our economic destiny? Our democracy? So what to do?’’ Industry will need all the help it can get from government to expand and diversify to new markets, he wrote. As Mr Willox advised: “Don’t cave on our core beliefs and principles; be strong, don’t be weak. But also try to keep diplomatically talking and keep trading where we can.’’	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Recovery needs more doing and less planning	The Australian	Tax and industrial reform should be the highest priorities Five-year plans don’t have a particularly encouraging history, from those in the old Soviet Union to modern-day China. They’ve often led to famine, civil unrest and, naturally, further encroachment of government. Bureaucracies, however well-meaning, struggle to allocate resources efficiently because they cannot know the needs and wants of households and businesses, let alone innovate with the same vigour. So perhaps promising a “five-year plan” to lift the economy out of the deep rut it has fallen into was an inauspicious choice for the Coalition government — a few quality reforms would suffice.
Whatever they call it, government will have to make changes. The second quarter national accounts revealed the scale of the economic damage caused by the pandemic and our response to it. In just three months almost $35bn of income evaporated, the total number of hours worked collapsed 10 per cent, and federal and state governments — on taxpayers’ behalf — burned through almost $83bn in savings. Those figures exclude the impact of Victoria’s even harsher second lockdown, which might be extended further. Many economists tip the economy will shrink in the third quarter, too.
The government’s first priority must be to reopen state borders, closure of which is crushing tourism and border communities, and riding roughshod over Australians’ right, perhaps constitutional, to travel freely within the country. Queensland and Western Australia fared relatively better in the national accounts because they didn’t shut down their economies as much as other states, not because they have closed their borders, as the WA and Queensland premiers have naively claimed. Six months into the pandemic and national cabinet still has not determined a definition for hotspots, clusters, and when and how they should trigger a response. That’s creating major uncertainty.
If the rest of the plan encompassed genuine tax and industrial relations reform, rather than platitudes and sound bites, we’d be doing well. The government must drop its trademark timidity. The modest tax cuts slated for 2024 — which reverse some of the bracket creep across the past decade — should be brought forward to begin early next year. It’s this so-called third tranche that packs the economic punch: lower marginal rates and a simplified tax schedule. The inevitable claim that bringing tax cuts forward is somehow “unfair” ignores the reality of what has occurred: perhaps the biggest transfer of wealth from top-rate taxpayers, who pay the bulk of income tax, to everyone else in the nation’s history. As the Australian Bureau of Statistics said this week, social security payments to households surged 42 per cent in the second quarter. It is higher-income earners, ultimately, who will have to service the surge in debt to fund JobKeeper, JobSeeker and the alphabet soup of other support payments.
Industrial relations reform, while politically more challenging, is equally if not more important given the surge in joblessness. When measured realistically, it is likely to exceed 10 per cent. However controversial the recommendations of the government’s five working groups tasked with simplifying the so-called modern award may be, it must prosecute them. The temptation to put off reforms and commission yet more reviews will be strong. The Grattan Institute’s outgoing director, John Daley, made a sobering finding this week, having trawled the OECD’s recommendations to Australia since 1972. Between 1984 and 2001, through the Hawke, Keating and early years of the Howard governments, these recommendations were broadly accepted. “But from roughly 2003 the record is a lot more patchy … policies that have run into the sand include reducing the gap between the company tax and top personal income tax rates, implementing a mining resource rent tax, reviewing negative gearing, creating competitive neutrality among Australian ports, and aligning the eligibility ages for super and the pension,” Mr Daley said. We may not agree with all those proposals but a culture of commissioning reports that gather dust cannot continue. Households and businesses are best positioned to plan and generate prosperity; the government should focus on simplifying tax and workplace laws to make it easier for them to do so. Victoria may have copied China’s response to the coronavirus pandemic; we don’t want to copy China’s hands-on planning strategy too.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Ditch policy complacency for fresh economic agenda	The Australian	Tax cuts are necessary but not sufficient in post-crisis world
Australians are becoming restless about an economy in an induced coma to suppress the spread of the coronavirus. Travel bans, industry shutdowns and social restrictions have anaesthetised enterprises, throwing millions on to the Morrison government’s subsidised payroll. More pain is on the way, with forecasts of a 10 per cent contraction in gross domestic product and 20 per cent reduction in hours worked. Future Fund chairman Peter Costello sees some companies emerging stronger from the worst crisis since the Depression, while some will disappear. We can already discern the vortex of calamity, with the tourism sector, a vast income earner and employer, facing devastation. Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham says it will take many years for the international aviation and cruise industries to recover.
It is possible Australians will learn to holiday at home, although not in their homes. A weak dollar will reinforce the trend. COVID-19’s toll on lives and incomes in the US, Britain, China and Italy, major sources of inbound tourism, will leave a long tail of woe. Perhaps a negotiated relaxation of restrictions with New Zealand will create a “trans-Tasman bubble”, beneficial to two countries that have had great success in containing the virus. But filling the void of tourists from the rest of the world, won’t be easy, no matter how clean, green and COVID-19-free we prove to be Down Under. Virgin Australia’s failure was multidimensional. In rebuffing the carrier’s pleas for a bailout Josh Frydenberg was resolute that one-off deals for companies were not on. Any new assistance must be sector-specific or available to all enterprises.
A broader and bolder reform plan would pay higher dividends for the nation in the long run. Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott argues we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remake the nation. “We must be an aspirational society that rewards hard work and puts money in the pockets of ordinary Australians, and an entrepreneurial society where we can keep and attract the best and brightest,” she wrote in our pages on Monday. She echoed calls for reform from her members, some of whom shared their thoughts with John Durie at the weekend. Yet, as we hurtle towards possible economic oblivion, observers such as Alan Kohler wonder if the reform crowd is quarantined on an elite opinion fantasy island. “We are in the midst of a global pandemic and an economic depression, with government deficits rising to telephone numbers, and vested interests are rolling up their sleeves to ensure this is a crisis that doesn’t go to waste,” he argues. But we can, and must, do better.
Our political and policy machinery had become sub-optimal, to say the least, before the world went bat-soup crazy. Business had lost its risk-taking zest. Investment was in a deep hole. Young people were not starting new enterprises or innovating. Workers were staying in jobs longer, content, perhaps aspiring to less. It meant our economy was not as dynamic, creative or flexible as it could be. We got used to rising living standards and wealth via higher export returns, soaring home prices, overvalued stocks and growth in population. But returns for our toil stagnated as we worked old capital, tools and infrastructure beyond use-by dates; our global competitiveness sagged because of workplace rigidities, ancient regulations and high taxes, among many other constraints.
As Minerals Council of Australia chairwoman Helen Coonan notes, our company tax rate is 3 per cent higher than the G20 average and the second highest in the developed world. “Higher taxes will discourage investment, impede growth and threaten jobs,” she writes of the post-pandemic policy agenda required to achieve faster business-led growth. A nation reliant on foreign capital needs a competitive tax regime that encourages investment. That’s a fundamental principle.As we argued two years ago when Malcolm Turnbull tried, but failed, to reduce the company tax rate to 25 per cent for all enterprises, we need a system that promotes aspiration and expansion; that is efficient and simple; that better balances federal and state financial responsibilities. It’s a huge agenda, as Ken Henry’s tax review showed a decade ago. Yet nothing bold has been done to improve a dilapidated, complicated system. It’s time. Almost immediately Labor has dismissed the push for lower taxes as an old right-wing ideological obsession or a cash grab by foreign shareholders. The saving grace, perhaps, is the nation’s aspirational class — from workers building assets for retirement to those trying to give their children a boost into home ownership — dodged a $387bn cluster bomb of taxes that would have obliterated our prosperity. The reforms Australia will need to navigate the post-corona world go way beyond tax relief and system repair, although returning fiscal drag to medium-income families should be a greater priority than it was a year ago. Amid the misery, there is goodwill and energy to drive a reform program. The nation will struggle to reduce unemployment and deficits, pay down debt and achieve financial security if it doesn’t ditch complacency. We need a fresh game plan for growth.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Crisis we cannot afford to waste	The Australian	Taxation reform would boost the post-COVID recovery As Australians struggle through our economy’s largest contraction since the 1930s, the case for tax reform — shifting away from incentive-killing income, company and payroll taxes, stamp duty and other “nuisance taxes” — is compelling. Adam Creighton has reported a new analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers showing that a revenue-neutral switch from less efficient taxes (mainly income taxes) to consumption taxes would increase gross domestic product. The national cabinet, unlike the sclerotic Council of Australian Governments it has replaced, affords governments on both sides a better chance to enact reform. Broadening the base of the GST to include fresh food, childcare, health, education, water and sewerage would raise about $21bn. Lifting the rate on the existing base from 10 to 12 per cent would raise $14.5bn. These would be worthwhile goals. The current rate, compared with the 19.3 average rate among OECD nations, is very modest.
Even ardent advocates of reform admit such change — which on paper would deliver a windfall to the states while the Morrison government wore most of the political flak — is highly unlikely in view of the realpolitik. But a willingness to put growth, jobs and the national interest first on the part of the major parties — in the states and at federal level in the Senate where any battle would be fought — could curtail the political fallout.
For all its manifest shortcomings, Anthony Albanese’s invitation to Scott Morrison to work co-operatively to achieve “bipartisan agreement” on climate change suggests COVID-19 appears to be changing the politics of that issue. Taxation reform demands a similar constructive mindset, informed by good economic policy — similar to the approach the Coalition, in opposition, took to many of Labor’s initiatives in the Hawke-Keating years.
But Labor, which does not govern but can veto, equates the GST with tax inequity, as Paul Kelly wrote last week. It does not accept the benefits of GST reform as argued by many economists. And opposition Treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers has made clear the party will not accept GST reform by lifting the rate or extending the base. For the Morrison government, the threat of a Labor campaign against any GST-led tax reform, even one that compensated losers, would be a critical disincentive.
Expanding the GST is not the be-all and end-all of tax reform, however. As Creighton wrote on Saturday, GST reform received only a few pages in NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet’s federation and tax review. That report, from the government of our largest state, demonstrates there is an appetite for reform, much of which should be supported by other states. The report canvassed replacing stamp duty with land tax and improving payroll tax — the ultimate jobs killer. It also discussed replacing petrol excise with road-user charging. Those measures, as Creighton wrote, “are all bigger and lower-hanging pieces of fruit on the tax reform tree’’. The national cabinet is the ideal forum in which they should be debated and refined, with a view to simplifying the tax system and encouraging economic activity and the creation of new jobs. In his statement on Tuesday, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe reported that while leading economic indicators have picked up, “the outlook remains uncertain and the recovery is expected to be bumpy and will depend upon containment of the coronavirus”. The six-week shutdown of Melbourne and the neighbouring Mitchell Shire announced by Daniel Andrews will compound the already difficult challenge of post-COVID-19 recovery. So will the closure of the Victorian-NSW border. Dire as it is, the crisis gives all governments and political parties an opportunity to take a long-term view. The farsighted reforms of the Hawke-Keating years, and John Howard’s GST, which almost cost him the 1998 election, set Australia up for several decades of growth. A mix of well-planned, sensible taxation reforms, to be implemented as recovery gathers pace and not in the middle of the crisis, would set the nation up well for the future.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
It ain’t ‘progressive’ if kids don’t make real progress	The Australian	Teaching isn’t easy, so parents and reformists need to help Kids are back at school and the family dog wonders where they’ve gone. It’s a chance for the adults to do some sharp thinking about education. The point has been well made that lost classroom time can be harmful, like theft from a child’s otherwise enriched future. We should turn our minds not only to lost hours of schooling but also to how successfully those hours are spent. For some time now international test results have shown an erosion of our basic numeracy and literacy. It’s a familiar complaint among parents, teachers and students that rigour and focus get lost amid a sprawling, something-for-everyone curriculum and so-so classroom management. The aim must be to challenge and motivate students so they get off to a good start with a love of learning and a sense of the links between application, knowledge and achievement.
This is easier said than done, and the task for teachers is made more difficult by poorly structured incentives and competing demands, especially if they have to do their job while parents are quick to complain but not especially engaged in their children’s education. Perhaps after losing the battle over screentime during isolation parents will have a keener appreciation for teachers’ efforts and get more involved in the busy life of their local schools. At least it may make the next spell of pandemic-driven home schooling less stressful and more successful.
But COVID-19 can’t banish the unfinished business of education reform. Teacher training in the universities has long been in need of an overhaul and it is rare for an education minister to attempt anything like systematic change. The education faculties need to attract students with a stronger academic record. Part of the problem is the university funding model in which it makes sense for vice-chancellors to enrol large numbers of poor-quality students and redirect revenue from their fees to other activities of the institution. But, to attract better-quality students, education faculties will have to earn a reputation for offering deep learning in core subjects, less social justice virtue signalling, more effective instruction in teaching methods and seriously useful experience in practice teaching, with a very close working arrangement between faculty and school. Some education faculties already do this, but it is not cheap or easy and it requires a fresh injection of academic talent. There is nothing progressive in turning out teacher graduates who, with the best intentions, see themselves as social change agents but are weak in their core subjects and struggle to engage students and control the class.
Teaching as a profession is caught in a catch-22: it needs higher-calibre graduates to lift its prestige and sense of self-worth, but without those social goods it will keep attracting too many students who would be better off outside a classroom. It needs effective politicians to champion genuine reform against resistance. Unfortunately, what passes for debate is often mere boasting about ever-increasing funding, a trend that has coincided with deteriorating standards, rather than discussion of the evidence on how to get the best academic and social outputs for a fiscal input. It’s not encouraging that in teaching how to read — a relatively simple field in which the evidence of what works is crystal clear — there are still state systems that refuse to modernise their practices. As Jennifer Buckingham and Rebecca Urban wrote in The Weekend Australian, from their respective policy and personal positions, systematic phonics as taught in NSW is superior to the misleadingly named “balanced” approach found in Victoria. The problem is a fixation on what works in “progressive” theory, not what works in reality. It sounds exciting to espouse child-led education that maximises the autonomy of young people who are constantly bossed around. But some cognitive skills require a methodical and structured approach. If this is ignored, children fall behind in literacy. Those from stable, educated backgrounds will get help in time and they begin with many other advantages. The disadvantage of the rest is only redoubled. This is truly regressive and testifies in miniature to a pervasive problem in our education system: an emotive preoccupation with abstract quasi-political objectives and a lack of intellectual seriousness about the education that children are entitled to as they make their way in the world.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Facebook’s unfriendly request	The Australian	Tech giant has warped views of fair pay and competition
In April the Morrison government ordered the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission to formulate a world-first mandatory code for Google and Facebook to pay media companies for their content, after talks failed on a voluntary code. We weren’t surprised. Monopoly tech giants treat the internet like private property, a playground to plunder, where might is always right. It became clear the platforms had not been bargaining in good faith; a deal with publishers was unlikely by the November deadline. So the ACCC was asked to come up with a draft code by the end of next month. Google and Facebook will be directed to share data, properly display news content and pay a fair price for it. Still, ACCC chairman Rod Sims fired a warning, telling the titans not to use dirty tricks, such as pulling news content from platforms in the interim, as had occurred overseas.
Imbalance of market power is one thing but outright theft of content that is expensive to produce — such as The Australian’s stories, images, audio and video — ruined the business model of news outlets. COVID-19 has ramped up pressure on publishers, including our parent, News Corp Australia, forcing newspaper closures, rationalisation of titles and job losses. In April, Josh Frydenberg said it was only fair search engines and social media giants pay for the original news content they use to drive traffic to their sites. “It is time the tech titans were held to account and we have genuine competition, we have a level playing field, we have more transparency, and we get payment for original journalistic content,” he said.
A landmark 18-month ACCC probe revealed the power of the privateers. More than 98 per cent of searches on mobile devices are with Google, while Facebook has about 17 million users who are connected to its platform for at least a half-hour a day. That level of market concentration and power was never envisaged by our regulatory system, the Treasurer said. For every $100 spent by advertisers in Australia on online advertising, excluding classifieds, $47 goes to Google, $24 to Facebook and $29 to other participants. This market is worth almost $9bn a year in Australia and has grown more than eightfold since 2005.
Major media companies Nine Entertainment and News Corp expect Facebook and Google to pay between $600m and $1bn a year for original news content. But Facebook now flatly rejects the notion of sharing advertising revenue and threatens to remove news from its platform if it is forced to. In a submission to the ACCC, it even argues the absence of news on its platform “would mean publishers miss out on the commercial benefits of reaching a wide and diverse audience, and social value would be diminished because news would be harder to access for millions of Australians”. That takes some front and ethical bankruptcy. Then Facebook doubles down, provocatively claiming online referrals from its News Feed for the first five months of the year were worth $195.8m to media companies. Working out a fair payment framework should not be impossible. Mr Frydenberg has suggested a “value option”, based on the number of eyeballs to digital platforms, or a “cost option”, meaning the tech giants would pay only a fraction of the vast cost of producing news. The ACCC found that between 8 and 14 per cent of searches contain news stories. “There is value on both sides here,” Mr Sims noted. But Facebook, even this late in the game, neither accepts the ACCC’s original analysis of market power nor the government’s moral argument that the laws of the physical world must apply in the digital realm. Shamefully, Facebook claims “the code needs to recognise that there is healthy, competitive rivalry in the relationship between digital platforms and news publishers, in that we compete for advertising revenue”. Having built obese, predatory trillion-dollar companies by plundering our content, the titans are not in the habit of sharing or abiding by the rules of fair play, nor the least bit concerned about the health of a dying news ecosystem.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Google short-changing searchers	The Australian	Tech giants must pay for the news content they use to attract ads For a company founded in 1998 purportedly “to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful’’, Google has a peculiar way of treating its customers, the general public — by denying them the service it was set up to provide.
At an important time for news, when Australians are focused on COVID-19, vaccines, borders, trade tensions with China, Test cricket and the US political upheavals, Google has buried links from traditional media outlets, including The Australian, in some of its search results. Google claims the move is a “short-term experiment … that will reach about 1 per cent of Google Search users in Australia to measure the impacts of news businesses and Google Search on each other’’. It is hard to interpret the so-called “experiment’’ as anything but an ­escalation of a long-running dispute between the tech giant and mainstream Australian publishers.
In December, the Morrison government introduced world-first reforming legislation that will force Google and Facebook to pay for news content they use and share data collection methods with media companies and public broadcasters. For years, tech giants have used valuable news content from local publishers, without recompense, to reap an advertising bonanza.
The legislation was formulated after an Australian Competition & Consumer Commission probe found that for every $100 of online advertising spent, $53 goes to Google, $28 to Facebook and $19 to other media ­companies. In the interests of a diverse, vibrant press capable of holding business and government to account, the profits generated by readers need to be distributed more fairly, so more of them can be reinvested in journalism. But if Google were able to hide commercial media outlets from its search results, doing so might allow it to dodge the looming legislation, as David Swan reports.
Media companies around the world are watching progress of the legislation, which is currently before a Senate committee, with keen interest. Once it is passed, overseas media will be following its implementation and assessing its effects. In December, David Chavern, chief executive of the US-based News Media Alliance, which represents 2000 news organisations, said Australia was at the leading edge of a worldwide movement to renegotiate the terms of trade for online news content. “Google and Facebook pay to license music because a system for compensating that content was created 100 years ago,’’ Mr Chavern told The Australian. “We are in another historic moment where we are creating new compensation systems for journalism.’’ Britain’s News Media Association, which represents local, regional and national news publi­shers in the UK, wants the Johnson government to impose similar legislation.
On Thursday, Josh Frydenberg hit out at Google for blocking news links for some Australian users. The tech giants should focus on paying for news, rather than burying it, the Treasurer said. The opposition is committed in principle to the legislation, which will benefit Australian consumers. Big Tech paying a fair price to use content produced by media organisations will help sustain strong and vibrant local journalism. If it becomes law, Google and Facebook would be forced to negotiate over the value of media companies’ original content and would face fines of up to $10m if they failed to comply with the laws. The arbitration framework must consider two-way value exchange between the parties, but payments can flow only from digital platforms to news media businesses. One Google search user who found himself unable to access news this week was The Australian’s Adam Creighton. As he wrote on Thursday, the “spectre of foreign tech giants permanently deleting news stories written by Australian journalists is a chilling demonstration of their immense market power and, more profoundly, their control of all digital information. It’s also unusual timing, given fellow tech giant Twitter has purged millions of users, including the US President, underscoring its collective power”. While Google argues it provides news sites with millions of dollars worth of “referral traffic”, it also benefits enormously, as Creighton said, from its users’ ability to find media content, produced at huge cost by the media. Like Creighton, many internet users could be driven by the “experiment’’ to seek alternative search engines such as Bing.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Google out to keep its free lunch	The Australian	Tech giants should operate under normal business rules
Faced with having to pay for news content, internet giant Google has put on a histrionic display that proves the company is well prepared to exploit its market power for corporate ends. Google is encouraging users of its products worldwide to join a social media pile-on against the Australian government and its competition regulator, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission. Recommendations from the ACCC that Google be forced to negotiate with publishers on what to pay for news has been a long time coming and could become law this year.
It is no doubt seen by Google as the continuation of a decades-long global effort by government to make internet companies operate under the same norms of business as everybody else. This applies to competition, market dominance and the laws of copyright. Google’s response is a re-run of tactics employed to head off earlier attempts at proper regulation in the US and in Europe. Congress in the US abandoned what had been bipartisan legislation to defend intellectual property rights when faced with Google-led public pressure a decade ago. In 2018-19 Google ran a similar campaign asking YouTube users to protest against proposed copyright laws in Europe.
The Times newspaper exposed in August 2018 that Google was helping to fund a website that encouraged people to spam politicians and newspapers with automated messages backing its policy goals. The company has yet to explain exactly why YouTube users around the world will be affected by Australian legislation that does not apply to YouTube. Or exactly what the peril to the platform might be or what the Silicon Valley-based behemoth intends to do about it. The evidence for Google, however, is that earlier attempts to pressure government in this fashion have worked.
Given the regulatory pressures being applied to the tech giants in the US, Europe and Australia, we can expect the online games to continue.
The proposed Australian rules differ from those dropped in Europe because they focus on competition rather than copyright. In Australia, the proposed new code applies to Google Search, Google News and Google Discover. It also will apply to Facebook products Newsfeed, Instagram and the proposed Facebook News Tab. Submissions close on public consultation on August 28 and legislation could be ready for parliament in October. Once it is passed, the tech companies and media companies will have three months to negotiate, at the end of which the process goes to final offer arbitration.
Google’s attempt to disrupt the process shows how high the stakes have become. Whatever happens in Australia will be watched keenly in the US, where the tech giants are facing an antitrust investigation into uncompetitive behaviour. The US has a long history of corporate giants of the day eventually being brought to heel for the public benefit. These include railroad barons, telecommunications giants and Microsoft. For corporate observers this is the point at which the rubber hits the road for tech companies that have been able to work outside traditional business norms by not having to pay for things supplied by other professionals. As John Durie observed on Tuesday, the lengths to which Google is prepared to go to defend its patch illustrate that there is an inherent value for it in repackaging the original news content produced by others. The company is merely highlighting why it should be prepared to pay news publishers fair compensation. The immediate challenge is for regulators and politicians on all sides to see through Google’s self-interest, act to preserve good business practice by supporting the ACCC recommendations and, in doing so, safeguard the future health and financial wellbeing of journalism.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Lessons from NT Covid-19 poll	The Australian	Territorians will benefit from having a stronger opposition
The nation’s first election of the COVID-19 pandemic, held in the Northern Territory on Saturday, holds important lessons for Queensland and Western Australia, whose governments face the polls next.
NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner is on track to be returned with or without a majority in the 25-seat unicameral Legislative Assembly. In contrast to 2016, when Labor won 18 seats and the opposition Country Liberals just two (it became one when former leader Gary Higgins retired), the new parliament is better balanced. As CLP leader Lia Finocchiaro said on election night: “The CLP is back.’’ She did well to bring her party back from near oblivion. It will have at least three seats, and possibly more.
The count is close, with some seats turning on a handful of votes. It is too soon to know if independents will play a supporting part in a new Labor government. Former chief minister Terry Mills’s new Territory Alliance flopped after he promised to end fracking, which the major parties support. It was a bad mistake.
Like Mr Gunner, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who goes to the polls on October 31, and WA Premier Mark McGowan, who faces voters in March, are playing parochial politics hard during COVID pandemic. But they will need to campaign on more than their coronavirus records. The NT has had no deaths from the virus and no recorded cases of community transmission. Keeping Territorians safe was the focus of Mr Gunner’s campaign. Border lockdowns are seen as popular among voters, and the NT has imposed 14 days of quarantine on visitors from COVID hotspots — currently Victoria and metropolitan Sydney. But many voters wanted more in other policy areas of government. Mr Gunner made no major promises. But the CLP will have plenty to scrutinise in the next four years. A COVID-19 “crisis’’, such as it is in the NT, might not be seen as the time for austerity. But a looming debt crisis, an ever-expanding public sector wages bill and poor service delivery in remote regions leave the government, and the opposition, with plenty to do.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
FROM THE EDITOR	Bay of Plenty Times	Thank you for picking up your new-look community newspaper, the Hauraki Coromandel Post.
Our team are proud to be the vehicle for serving a bigger area than we ever have before. The merging of our two titles, the Coastal News and Waihi Leader during level 4 lockdown was among the changes we made as a business employing local people in this challenging year.
Working in partnership with our Coromandel and Hauraki advertisers, we’ve been your community voice for over 40 years — a tradition of local journalism and sales and marketing professionals who care about our communities and want to see them succeed.
This week’s edition is an election special, allowing readers to gain insight into the Coromandel electorate candidates.
Sitting in the audience at Waihi’s recent Meet the Candidates meeting, I was struck by the calibre and passion of all our candidates and their life experience and skills.
It’s a reflection of our communities here in the Coromandel Hauraki region.
Regardless of your personal beliefs or your politics, these candidates deserve to be treated with our utmost respect. I could hear not only the questions from the floor but the mutterings of those who made the effort to come, and some would comment on a candidate’s response as though forgetting that they are politicians, not magicians.
I’ve read a definition of civility as “Claiming and caring for one’s identity, needs and beliefs without degrading someone else’s in the process.”
It was good to see this happening — most of the time — among our candidates for Coromandel. When one would speak over the top of another, a call would come from the audience to “let them finish speaking”.
These candidates are members of our community, just like us, busy making a living to feed their family, work their organic farm, volunteer at their nearest recycling depot, or run their own small business.
They are not paid politicians.
With the exclusion of our current Member of Parliament, National MP Scott Simpson, they are not elected, therefore they do not sit in Parliament and have not yet had the opportunity to represent us.
There was demands from some in the audience for a return to democracy, but this meeting demonstrated democracy in action.
We freely walked into an event organised by volunteers, listened to local people volunteering their time to speak freely about their beliefs, and now our job is to stand up and be counted with our vote.
Be sure to send me your thoughts on the new paper, or any news tips or contributions.

Nation’s moment of truth on alleged war crimes	The Australian	The ADF’s chain of command must also be held to account Scott Morrison and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds have responded decisively to the final report of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force into allegations of war crimes by Australian troops in Afghanistan. The Prime Minister, supported by his minister, has initiated the next steps in a gruesome, protracted process, announcing he will appoint a Special Investigator, with prosecutorial powers, to be located within the Department of Home Affairs. The move sends a message that in a democratic nation, our military forces are subject to civilian oversight.
This is especially important as both the current Chief of the Defence Force and Chief of Army served in the Special Air Service Regiment, the latter commanding it during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. For the sake of public confidence and veterans’ morale, it is imperative the entire chain of command be held accountable in any proceedings against those who bore the brunt of the fighting in Afghanistan. While soldiers and junior leaders are likely to face the full force of the law, justice demands the chain of command is scrutinised. That is not to cast any aspersions on the integrity of General Campbell or Lieutenant General Burr. However, given the time frame over which the alleged war crimes occurred and the tight-knit, opaque world of the Special Forces, there cannot be any hint of nepotism or conflict of interest when justice is dispensed to some and others continue to be promoted or decorated.
As we have said, SAS troops were misemployed in so-called decapitation operations against Taliban leadership targets. Large-scale combat operations were never the role of this elite regiment. While conventional infantry were largely idle, our SAS troopers and commandos were deployed on multiple tours by politicians and senior leaders who exploited their unique skills and hoped they would not suffer casualties on a scale to provoke political backlash at home. This meant, inevitably, that many elite troops were repeatedly deployed. It took its toll on their mental health and their judgment. Some may have grown callous and indiscriminate in the use of force against a population among whom it was difficult to identify friend from foe. Those who certified Special Forces were fit for purpose in this period must be called to account. Charging a handful of corporals and sergeants while senior leaders receive honours and promotions would breach the remaining cohesion of the SAS, already at breaking point after years of leaks to selected media. The measures outlined on Thursday are sound but the government should unconditionally reject any suggestion the SAS be disbanded. It possesses extraordinary capabilities. Training costs billions of dollars over decades. SAS troops are unique, indispensable and irreplaceable. The SAS must not be disbanded nor merged with the Commando Regiment, whose role is vastly different. Now action is under way, there is no need for the review, commissioned by the CDF, by former naval officer and Anglican bishop Tom Frame. It is no longer relevant. This process has already gone on far too long. The culture of the SAS is basically sound. That is why so many of its members provided vital evidence to the IGADF inquiry — a measure of moral courage and integrity. Defence in general and Special Forces in particular have had their culture studied by highly paid consultants for far too long. The crucial issues now are for the criminal justice system to determine.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Containing virus half the battle as rollout draws fire	The Australian	The ALP must not put political pointscoring before national interest
Having declared victory in containing the COVID-19 pandemic spread domestically, the federal government is still fighting to win the peace. Scott Morrison and his Health Minister, Greg Hunt, are faced with worrying trends overseas and high expectations at home. Their challenge is to present a calm and professional front while dealing with issues that are either unexpected or outside their control. Domestic politics will ensure it will not be an easy task. In question time on Wednesday, the opposition made clear it had surrendered any notion of bipartisan support for the vaccine rollout. Opposition health spokesman Mark Butler asked the Prime Minister why the government was able to co-ordinate the publicity for the next phase of the vaccine rollout but not the delivery. The question followed complaints that some elderly were finding it difficult to make appointments for vaccination against the COVID-19 virus with their GPs. The answer is that vaccinations will only become possible from Monday and GPs are wanting to ensure they have guaranteed supplies before scheduling appointments. Mr Morrison accused the opposition of failing the test of national unity in seeking to undermine confidence in the national vaccine program.
With winter approaching and a worrying deterioration in the situation immediately to our north in Papua New Guinea, the government must quickly demonstrate that it is on top of things. The approach must be to remain open and transparent about what is happening regarding vaccine delays and with reported concerns about the safety of vaccines being raised overseas. Mr Morrison gave clear details of the problem of supplies from Europe when he said only 700,000 doses had been delivered from an order of 3.8 million. Europe is also at the heart of safety fears over the AstraZeneca vaccine. This week, France, Germany and Italy became the latest in a growing list of European countries to announce that they were temporarily halting the use of the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, because of concerns over blood clots. Australia has elected not to pause its vaccination program. Australia’s chief scientist, Cathy Foley, says she has full faith in the AstraZeneca vaccine and the European Medical Agency says it remains firmly convinced that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.
The results of urgent studies this week are expected to show that the number of blood clots in vaccinated people is no higher than the number seen in the general population. Results from clinical trials have shown fewer than 1 per cent of those who reported reactions went on to suffer serious illness. Of those who did, more had been given a placebo rather than the vaccine. The rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe has become enmeshed in the bigger regional politics over Brexit. Mr Morrison has appealed to Europe to release more doses of the vaccine ordered by Australia so they can be used to assist in the deteriorating situation in Papua New Guinea. Australia has responded quickly to help PNG and reinforced quarantine and other health measures in northern Australia to help prevent any cross-border transmissions between the countries. The government is hoping that a ramp-up in domestic production of the AstraZeneca vaccine will help to put things back on track. With traditional cold and flu season approaching, Australia needs to get supply lines moving quickly to ensure a smooth rollout through GPs. The high rate of inquiry for a vaccine injection shows that demand, and therefore confidence in the vaccine, is still strong in the community. Given that broad coverage is needed for the vaccine to be effective, ensuring this remains the case is a top priority. The opposition is right to hold the government to account on its vaccine promises but must be careful not to unnecessarily undermine confidence in the program for purely political gain.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
ANZUS allies in lock-step against Beijing’s aggression	The Australian	The AUSMIN meeting has agreed on important initiatives The Trump administration, Cameron Stewart reported on Wednesday, was “thrilled” by the success of the AUSMIN meeting for which Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds travelled to Washington. Australia should be, too. Amid deepening global uncertainty, especially due to China’s unrelenting bad behaviour, the 30th iteration of the Australian-US Ministerial Consultation confirms the strength of the strategic alliance. As Scott Morrison said on Monday, it remains the bedrock of our defence strategy at a critical time. The agreements reached by Senator Payne and Senator Reynolds with their US counterparts Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper, showed Australia is regarded as the “model ally” the US needs in confronting a rising and increasingly belligerent China. Mr Pompeo’s reassurance that Australia will never stand alone in promoting its values in the Indo-Pacific was welcome.
The agreements involve substantially expanded, though yet to be fully disclosed, joint military efforts in Darwin. They include the positioning there of a major fuel reserve. They also involve intensified co-operation on missile and hypersonic defence technologies and measures to counter China’s malign “grey zone” warfare, such as cyber intrusions. Australia and the US are also devel­oping closer supply chain links, with Australian rare-earth miner Lynas to receive Pentagon funding to establish a processing plant in Texas, reducing US dependence on China for materials critical to defence manufacture.
The meeting also showed the need for other US allies to do far more to help confront Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific. The focus of the Washington meeting was on the growing threat posed by China to the right of freedom of navigation through the South China Sea and the sovereignty of nations in the region. But with a third of the world’s shipping and $US3 trillion ($4.1 trillion) of trade passing through the South China Sea each year, nations such as Japan, India and South Korea, as well as European nations including Britain, France and Germany, need to confront Beijing’s hegemonic designs and disregard for international law. The trade and economic welfare of those nations is no less threatened by China’s contempt for a rules-based world order than Australia’s interests. It would be a mistake if they ignored Mr Pompeo’s pleas for democratic allies to follow our example and stand up to Beijing, even if doing so hurts them economically. Decisions taken at the meeting show the importance of the South Pacific within the world order.
For good reasons, Senator Payne and Senator Reynolds were cautious about meeting Washington’s request for Australia to take part in freedom of navigation operations within disputed territorial waters claimed by China in the South China Sea. For the time being there will be no change in the status quo, which has seen Australia working closely with US naval deployments across the region, with our warships playing a major role in the Rim of the Pacific Exercise and other naval exercises. Less than 100 days from the US election, it would have been unwise to rush into doing otherwise. As Greg Sheridan wrote on Tuesday, our warships in the South China Sea would be secure only if we conducted FONOPS in the company of the US navy: “But if we are the only nation in the region to do so, we certainly do set ourselves up for exemplary punishment by the Chinese.” FONOPS would have far more force if they also involved other countries such as Japan or India or South Korea.
As Senator Payne noted, while the US and Australia are the closest of allies, “we don’t agree on everything, though — and that’s part of a respectful relationship … we make our own decisions”. Australia’s relationship with China, she said, “is important to us and we do not want to injure it”. The strength of our ties with the US has been evident in recent weeks, with both Washington and Canberra, to Beijing’s fury, declaring China’s claims in the South China Sea to be “totally unlawful”. Both nations also have condemned China’s imposition of a repressive new security law in Hong Kong and its oppression of China’s Uighur minority. We also have worked closely over the threat posed by Huawei, helping persuade Britain and France to think again about Huawei’s involvement in their 5G networks. Before Donald Trump, Barack Obama’s administration, as Sheridan noted, “let the South China Sea slip away, without ever exerting itself in any meaningful way, even diplomatically. It was one of the many colossal failures of the Obama presidency.” Tough policy statements by Mr Pompeo on China’s aggression have created a new urgency. They have done much to overcome the Trump administration’s uncertainty over a trade deal with Beijing. Whoever wins in the US in November, be it Mr Trump or Joe Biden, must be resolute in dealing with the communist regime. Rarely has the vitality of the US-Australian alliance been more crucial.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Democracies must unite against Chinese bullying	The Australian	The AUSMIN meeting will be crucial for regional security US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning that “if the free world doesn’t change China, Communist China will surely change us” has provided a stark backdrop to Tuesday’s AUSMIN consultation in Washington. It will be the 30th such meeting since AUSMIN’s establishment in 1985. The strength of the Australia-US alliance was clear on Saturday when Australia backed Washington in formally declaring Chinese claims in the South China Sea inconsistent with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and therefore illegal. The move provoked a predictably hysterical response from the communist regime’s maverick Global Times newspaper. It warned about “reckless provocations” and claimed sanctions on Australian beef and wine exports could follow.
As Mr Pompeo and US Defence Secretary Mark Esper meet Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds, there can be no disguising the challenges confronting both nations, and other democracies, especially in our region. Speaking at the Richard Nixon Library in California last week, Mr Pompeo declared “if we bend the knee now, our children’s children may be at the mercy of the Chinese Communist Party”.
Recalling Mr Nixon’s historic 1972 trip, which opened China to the world and enabled it to become a global economic force, Mr Pompeo lamented: “The kind of engagement we have been pursuing (with China) has not brought the kind of change in China President Nixon hoped to induce. The truth is that our policies — and those of other free nations — resurrected China’s failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that fed it.” China, Mr Pompeo said, took advantage of the opening to “lie, cheat and steal their way to power and prosperity”. He called for a coalition of democratic nations to force Beijing to change direction or face isolation, saying: “Western engagement with China cannot continue as it has.” With Donald Trump struggling in the polls, critics regard Mr Pompeo’s forthright arguments as an attempt to whip up the President’s populist base. Regardless of whether that was his intention, Mr Pompeo was on the right track given the belligerence of Beijing’s rulers.
At no time since recognising China has a US president concluded there was a need to shut down a Chinese diplomatic establishment. Mr Trump did so last week when he closed the Chinese consulate in Houston amid charges of Chinese officials stealing medical research and spying. A senior US intelligence official disclosed that the FBI is investigating 2000 active counterintelligence cases involving Chinese espionage.
There is plenty of evidence of Chinese aggression: threats of dire recriminations against the UK for the decision to get Huawei out of Britain’s 5G network and providing a refuge for Hong Kong residents fleeing Chinese oppression; in the Himalayas, Chinese forces have been attacking Indian troops; and as five Australian warships led by HMAS Canberra sailed through the South China Sea last week to join naval exercises with the US and Japan, satellite imagery showed Beijing deploying warplanes on disputed islands it claims.
A key issue for Australia, as Australian Strategic Policy Institute executive director Peter Jennings said on Monday, is whether Australian warships should engage in freedom of navigation operations within the 20km limit of the disputed land China claims.
Last week, Mr Pompeo blamed the global consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the way the WHO head, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had been “hook, line and sinker bought by the Chinese government”. Yet the CCP’s preoccupation is not with the global scourge caused by the virus but with Australia’s reasonable and globally supported call for an inquiry.
In The Weekend Australian, contributing national security editor Alan Dupont pointed out it is not just democracies that have become targets for Chinese bellicosity. Even “fraternal Vietnam and the accommodating Philippines” have not been spared Beijing’s bullying and intimidation. The risks in confronting Chinese aggression are significant. Efforts must be stepped up to convince Beijing that the policies being pursued by Xi Jinping will ultimately do immense damage to China. No one wants a military showdown. But Beijing cannot be allowed to dictate the terms of its engagement with a global system it seeks to destroy.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Victoria takes its first step out of Covid-19 nightmare	The Australian	The Andrews government’s serious errors remain a mystery
The hated curfew has gone from Monday. But for now, after so much hardship, Melburnians will have little to do outside their homes after 9pm unless five people from two households gather outdoors, within 5km of their homes. If a sixth person wanders along, they could all cop $5000 fines. The return to work of 127,000 people, allowing for the resumption of manufacturing industries with 90 per cent of their workforces and the stepping up of large-scale construction with 85 per cent of their workforces, will help the economy. So will the reopening of wholesale traders, the easing of shopping restrictions and reopening of childcare. The return of students to school is important in re-establishing normality. The resumption of limited visits to hospitals and care facilities will be welcomed deeply by the elderly and infirm after months of loneliness. Increasing elective surgery and reopening dental surgeries is important. Other concessions seem perfunctory, such as allowing five worshippers with one faith leader to attend outdoor services, which feels like a mockery to some churchgoers. Many small businesses, including pubs, clubs and restaurants, will remain closed until next month, at dire cost to themselves, staff and the economy.
As the 14-day rolling average of new cases of COVID-19 falls from the current 22 (well ahead of the target 30 to 50 cases), there is no reason to delay easing further restrictions until October 19. Premier Daniel Andrews has signalled that fast-tracking is a possibility. The draconian COVID-19 Omnibus (Emergency Measures) Bill, currently before the Victorian upper house, should be scrapped, as a group of former judges and QCs have urged. By the time the bill is voted on in mid-October, the daily tally of new cases could be in single digits.
At the same time, personal distancing and hygiene remain vital in avoiding further serous problems, in all states and territories. France’s record of 16,000 new cases on Thursday, 6600 in Britain and more than 1000 in New York on Saturday as the US death toll from the virus passed 200,000 are reminders of what is at stake. So are the serious warnings of neurological consequences likely to arise from coronavirus, including an escalation in the incidence of Parkinson’s disease.
While welcoming Mr Andrews’s small concessions, Scott Morrison, Josh Frydenberg and Health Minister Greg Hunt noted that “ at similar case levels NSW was fundamentally open while remaining COVID-safe due to a world-class contact-tracing facility”. The Morrison government has delivered more than $27bn of economic support to Victorians during the crisis. And the extension of JobKeeper for another six months is likely to see federal taxpayers underwriting the state by an additional $16.8bn in the December and March quarters, the Treasurer said.
Given the size of the economic hit, all Australians are entitled to answers about who was responsible for the disastrous decision to engage private security guards to oversee hotel quarantining, the fiasco that was responsible for most of the state’s second wave and the deaths of more than 750 people.
The resignation on Saturday of Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos raised more questions than it answered. Referring to Mr Andrews’s evidence to the inquiry on Friday, she said: “The fact that there are elements in it that I strongly disagree with, I believe that I cannot continue to serve in his cabinet.” Which elements of his statement? Victorians are entitled to know. As Caroline Overington writes online: “No one in the Andrews government knows who made the decision to hire private security guards? It just sort of happened? If that’s so, then let’s all forget about the problem of zombie businesses in Victoria. We have a zombie government.’’ Nor have Mr Andrews and his ministers explained why the state did not take up the Morrison government’s offer of ADF personnel to help with hotel quarantining. On Friday, Mr Andrews told the inquiry he had “no expectation’’ of such support after a national cabinet meeting in March. But this appeared to be contradicted by footage aired on Sky News on Sunday, It showed Mr Andrews answering a journalist’s question in March about how people returning from overseas would be kept in hotel quarantine rooms. He said: “We’ll utilise private security, we’ll also utilise members of Victoria Police and I’m grateful to the Prime Minister for his offer of support from the Australian Defence Force.’’ Melbourne remains another three weeks away from a substantial easing of coronavirus restrictions that would enable the hospitality and retail industries to reopen for business and residents to leave home without limitations. But the “safe and steady” steps out of stage-four restrictions are a step towards the end of a nightmare few in the city, especially those who have lost friends and family, will forget. Its economic fallout, however, is likely to be felt for a generation.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
A big hit for women and sport	The Australian	The Australian women’s cricket team has cemented its claim to be remembered as a deserving addition to the roll of the nation’s greatest sporting achievers. By filling the MCG to win the T20 World Cup against India before the pandemic interrupted play, the side proved there was a large and passionate audience for women’s cricket. On Sunday, having overtaken the 18-year record of 21 consecutive match wins by the Ricky Ponting-led Australian men’s team in 2003, the women’s side laid its claim to being the greatest team, full stop. Will Swanton has declared it Australia’s best sporting team. He says Ellyse Perry, Alyssa Healy and Meg Lanning are players who will be remembered as among the finest in history — up there with Ponting, Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath and Adam Gilchrist.
The unbeaten run of T20 victories by the women’s team follows a reassessment of tactics and approach in the wake of the shock semi-final loss to India in the 2017 World Cup. Changes included a big increase in pay for players. It is a clear demonstration that greater professionalism and higher wages bring results. The big winners are the public and cricket. With an estimated one-third of the nation’s players female, the future of the sport seems assured. With bigger crowds and greater recognition, sponsorship will follow the numbers. The fact broadcasters were slow to recognise the achievement’s significance demonstrates there is still some way to go. Nonetheless, the professionalism and performance of the women’s side will energise a generation of young girls and women to follow it. This is a great result and a healthy outcome for all women, and one that, with the longstanding Ponting record knocked off, calls on the men to lift their game.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Crown future depends on reform	The Australian	The Bergin report affirms why integrity is vital in running casinos
The City of Sydney and the integrity of the casino that should operate on the spectacular Barangaroo site ultimately will be the winners from the scathing report to the Independent Liquor & Gaming Authority review, released on Tuesday. The 768-page report by former NSW Supreme Court judge Patricia Bergin was blunt. Crown Resorts was ­unsuitable to hold a gaming ­licence, it said. That finding will force the company and its largest shareholder, billionaire James Packer, to prove it should be allowed to operate the $2.2bn casino. The detailed forensic report has done a good job in affirming the integrity of the gaming industry. It paves the way for Crown and any other operator to get their business in order in terms of ownership, leadership and governance. Doing so would be essential preparation for running an international tourist attraction befitting a city such as Sydney with public confidence.
Ms Bergin left the door open for Crown to right the wrongs of its past to retain its Sydney licence. But she made it clear the company would need a sweeping overhaul, starting with its board and corporate culture, if it was to succeed. “The burden of reformation will be great,” Ms Bergin wrote. Much, it appears, will depend on Crown chairwoman Helen Coonan, a former Howard government minister. Ms Coonan’s “character, honesty and integrity (have) not been and could not be called into question”, the report says. She “accepted the serious corporate failings of Crown and notwithstanding those corporate failings is willing to, as she put it, stay the course”.
Former Crown chairman John Alexander, in contrast, “led Crown to disastrous consequences”, Ms Bergin wrote. Mr Alexander’s loyalty to the Packer family left him “either blind to the reality or lacking in candour” in confronting serious problems ­such as the “infiltration of criminal elements”. Crown chief executive Ken Barton was deemed so “unimpressive” that the ILGA “would be justified in concluding that it cannot have any confidence in dealing” with him. Ms Bergin described Mr Packer, who holds a 37 per cent stake in Crown, as a “deeply flawed” close associate of the company. His position as a major shareholder will be considered by the ILGA.
The report established that Crown was exposed to the risk, which was realised, of criminals using its bank accounts for money laundering. Crown’s risk management and corporate governance were compromised and the risks to the safety of staff working in China were not appreciated. Looking to the future, Ms Bergin wrote that if “Crown is to survive this turmoil” and reform itself, “there is little doubt that it could achieve a fresh start and emerge a very much stronger and better organisation”.
Mr Packer was out on the front foot on Wednesday. In a statement, his private company, Consolidated Press Holdings, announced that two of his three nominee directors — Guy Jalland and Michael Johnston — would be resigning from the Crown board with immediate effect. “CPH and Mr Packer now believe it is crucial that Crown chairman Helen Coonan and the Crown board have the opportunity to meet with ILGA to progress Crown’s announced reform agenda,” the statement said.
Mr Packer’s third nominee, non-executive director John Poynton, terminated his consultancy agreement with CPH, a move that Crown says has severed CPH’s involvement with its board.
The Bergin report could have far-reaching consequences. The report and Crown’s responses are being examined closely by gaming regulators in Melbourne and Perth, where the company operates major casinos. It employs more than 5500 people in Perth and more than 10,000 in Melbourne, where it is Victoria’s biggest private sector employer. In December, the Victorian Commission for Gaming and Liquor Regulation brought forward its review into Crown’s entertainment complex by three years, citing the revelations around the Bergin inquiry, including evidence of money laundering. On Wednesday, West Australian Racing and Gaming Minister Paul Papalia instructed the State Solicitor to review the Bergin report’s “deeply concerning” findings as soon as possible. Austrac is formally investigating Crown for potential breaches of anti-money-laundering laws at its Melbourne casino. Crown’s Barangaroo gaming floor could open as early as April, even with Mr Packer as a major shareholder, NSW Independent Liquor & Gaming Authority chairman Philip Crawford said. The idea that Crown “needs to blow itself up to save itself” he said, was “probably pretty close to the mark”.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Who will drive gender inquiry?	The Australian	The British health system’s adoption of more cautious advice for under-18s and parents contemplating “transgender” medical treatments is a significant development in a global debate about medicalisation, ethics and informed consent. As Australia’s Health Minister, Greg Hunt has put this on the agenda for a gender clinic review by his state and territory counterparts. So, too, he has asked them to investigate the overrepresentation of teenagers with signs of autism in the clinics. He stresses state responsibility for children’s hospitals and has already set in train a review by a COAG council of health officials. As we report in Tuesday’s paper, Mr Hunt says he will ensure that concerns are “expressly and clearly addressed” by state bodies.
The risk is one of political ownership. It’s not a matter of prejudging the outcome of an inquiry but of political leadership reassuring the public that serious questions about the welfare of vulnerable young people will be pursued with rigour and determination. It’s not clear yet how the review mandated by Mr Hunt will be handled under national cabinet. The COAG council to discuss gender clinics on June 24 makes decisions by consensus. The states with big clinics are Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria, with the last the pacesetter. None of their health ministers has displayed any grasp of the debate. Queensland and Victoria would like to shut it down with spurious bans on “conversion therapy”. In August, when The Australian started reporting this issue, Mr Hunt asked a medical college for urgent advice but the brief response that turned up seven months later cannot be regarded as useful. So, who or what will drive the cause of a proper inquiry when powerful interests oppose it? In Britain, litigation is clearly a factor in the government flagging changes to protect minors from medical interventions they may come to regret. Trouble is, those who champion these treatments frame them as a human rights imperative and portray prudent scrutiny as a bigoted attack on at-risk youth. Nobody disputes that many of the trans-identifying teens of the post-2000s wave suffer from multiple problems. That is precisely why we have a duty to make expert and compassionate efforts to understand what it is that causes their distress and make sure that any medical treatments do good, not harm.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Chinese trade war on our coal shapes as an own goal	The Australian	The CCP’s behaviour could warrant legal action through the WTO As China continues its cat-and-mouse bullying over black-listing Australian coal, the Chinese government has not even had the courtesy to notify Australia about the apparent change of policy. As Scott Morrison said on Tuesday: “We take official information from the Chinese government … so that’s where we’re seeking clarification.” In the face of Chinese provocation, the Prime Minister and his government are responding responsibly and calmly. Any black-listing, as Mr Morrison said, would be a breach of World Trade Organisation rules and Australia’s free-trade agreement with China. The WTO has mechanisms, and in extreme cases penalties, for dealing with rule breaking and for settling disputes. Such procedures can be long and cumbersome. Australia’s formal action against China’s barley tariffs is “imminent”, Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said on Tuesday: “We’re close to making a final decision in that regard,” he said. Senator Birmingham is hoping to avoid having to take legal action about coal. He and Mr Morrison stressed Australia was willing to engage in dialogue to resolve the issues at stake.
Unfortunately, so far China has been recalcitrant in ignoring all overtures to hold mature, bilateral discussions after moving against Australian beef, lobster, wood and wine as well as barley and now coal. According to reports in the South China Morning Post, wool is being considered as the next target. And Australia’s largest mining companies — BHP and Rio Tinto — have been asked to explain to Chinese steel manufacturers why their iron ore prices are so high as the surging trade undermines Beijing’s eight-month trade campaign against Australia. The campaign is presumably a retaliation for the Morrison government’s entirely reasonable call in April for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus in Wuhan. But it is out of all proportion and reflects its true mindset, that of an authoritarian dictatorship. It also comes amid rising concerns about Chinese Communist Party members embedding themselves in overseas consulates, including that of Australia in Shanghai, and in companies holding sensitive contracts with the Australian and US governments.
China has not confirmed officially it has black-listed Australian coal. But after meetings in China on Saturday of the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s main economic planning agency, the CCP’s bellicose mouthpiece, the Global Times, reported approval had been given to power plants to import coal without clearance restrictions, except from Australia. Coal producers in Mongolia, Indonesia and Russia would benefit from the change in policy, it said.
That news will make for an anxious Christmas for coal workers, investors and those in the regional areas where the miners live and work in Australia. It is also bad news for the 1000 sailors stranded aboard 80 bulk carriers off China’s coast, which are not being allowed to unload. Not surprisingly, the ship owners holding the black-listed coal are threatening legal action against Chinese buyers, as Perry Williams reports. With China buying $13.5bn in coal a year, the crisis has put Australia’s industry under pressure. But China is not our biggest market for thermal coal, as Mr Morrison pointed out on Tuesday. Japan buys $9.6bn of thermal coal a year, followed by China ($4bn), South Korea ($3.3bn) and Taiwan ($2.8bn). The biggest markets for Australia’s metallurgical coal are India at $10.2bn, followed by China ($9.7bn), Japan ($7.4bn), South Korea ($3.8bn) and Taiwan ($2.5bn). The Australian resources sector believes China will have no option in the foreseeable future but to continue sourcing Australian metallurgical coal for steelmaking. But, as we have argued for months, diversification of markets is critical.
In jettisoning Australia’s second-largest export, China is also setting itself up for a lose-lose situation in terms of President Xi Jinping’s target of net-zero emissions by 2060. One tonne of Australian thermal coal produces as much energy as 1.5 tonnes of local Chinese product and other imported sources. As a result, emissions would be driven high if China opted for inferior-quality coal sourced domestically or in nations other than Australia. That issue will test the depth of China’s commitment to reducing its ballooning contribution to climate change. The Minerals Council of Australia is correct when it says the use of a rules-based system is vital to restoring stability to a trading relationship that has been beneficial for both nations, supporting years of economic growth and job creation, including in Australia’s regions. Mr Morrison and his ministers are seeking out their Chinese counterparts for bilateral talks, but to no avail so far. The government is right in rejecting the call by former trade minister Matt Canavan on Monday for a 1 per cent levy on Australian iron ore exports to China to offset the impacts of trade bans on other industries. In a fiendishly difficult situation, Australia’s greatest strength is the quality of our exports and the fact we play fairly, by the rules.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Sturdy foundation for the Quad	The Australian	The Chinese response to the summit is being awaited with interest
Amid deepening concern about the potential for military conflict in the Pacific, the first summit of leaders of the “Quad” nations, including Australia, was significant. As Scott Morrison said, the shared vision that emerged from his historic virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden and Prime Ministers Narendra Modi of India and Yoshihide Suga of Japan heralds a “new dawn” for the Indo-Pacific. It will have far-reaching consequences.
Direct mention of China was avoided in the official communiques. But it was China’s coercive behaviour that, according to Mr Biden’s National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, was front and centre. Beijing will be fooling only itself if it tries to downplay the importance of the uniformity of views the leaders of the region’s four major liberal democracies achieved over Chinese “coercion of Australia, their (China’s) harassment around the disputed (Japanese) Senkaku islands, (and) their aggression on the border with India”. Nor should China ignore the alliance’s emphatic commitment to ensure the Indo-Pacific is “anchored by democratic values” and that rights to freedom of navigation and overflight are “unconstrained by coercion”.
Chinese leaders should also heed the telling assessment after the summit by Toshi Yoshihara, of the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington. “Behind the (summit’s) polite language lies a stark strategic reality,’’ he wrote. “The Indo-Pacific naval balance of power is a multilateral one. If you add up the maritime capabilities of Australia, India, Japan and the US, the correlation of forces shifts against Beijing.” After the meeting, the Quad recommitted to a “shared vision for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, resilient and inclusive’’. The Quad leaders were striving to ensure that the Indo-Pacific was accessible and dynamic, governed by international law and bedrock principles such as freedom of navigation and peaceful resolution of disputes. All countries in the region need freedom to make their own political choices, free from coercion.
Such commitments underline the speed with which Mr Biden has moved less than two months since taking office. It was his first multilateral meeting since taking office and his participation underlined the importance he attaches to the region and the threat it faces. “It reflects his view that we have to rally democratic allies and partners in common cause and his belief in the centrality of the Indo-Pacific to national security,” Mr Sullivan said.
US presidents normally make NATO their immediate priority. That Mr Biden is focused firmly on this region is a promising sign he will not replicate the wasted Obama years. As we report on Monday, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has begun a trip to Tokyo, Seoul and New Delhi to boost defence co-operation and foster “credible deterrence” against China. The Quad’s decision to help the region overcome the devastation of COVID-19 is also deeply important. The leaders’ pledge to expand production to one billion doses of vaccine to be administered into 2022 is proactive and sensible. Australia will play a key role, committing $100m to distributing vaccines across the region. It should help counter the effects of China’s obscuring its role in allowing the pandemic to spread early on. As Greg Sheridan wrote on Saturday, “military conflict involving great powers remains a disturbing possibility’’. Australia would inevitably be drawn in. The unanimity of the Quad should help dissuade China from its current course.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Breaking the culture of dependency, entitlement	The Australian	The Coalition’s reforms are working, but more are needed
Maintaining a strong safety net for vulnerable individuals and families who are genuinely unable to support themselves is one of the tenets of our civilised society. At the same time, as we said in 2011: “Purposeful employment is fundamental to the self-worth and independence of everyone who is capable of undertaking it.” For that reason, and in the interests of budget repair, ensuring the safety net is affordable and preparing for the costs of supporting an ageing population, The Australian has championed major welfare reform for decades. Since 2013, the Coalition has shied away from the sweeping overhaul of welfare payments made by John Key’s government in New Zealand from 2008 to 2016. But figures released on Monday show the changes made in Australia since 2013 have been effective.
In June last year, 13.5 per cent of citizens aged 16 to 64 were in receipt of a welfare payment. That proportion is lower than at any time since 1989 and lower than the 16.5 per cent when Tony Abbott won office. Under Paul Keating in 1994 the figure was 23.6 per cent and it nudged up to 24.4 per cent in 1996, John Howard’s first year as prime minister. By 2007, despite generous and widespread family payments, the Howard government had reduced the proportion of citizens in receipt of welfare to 17.2 per cent.
The recent improvement, Families and Social Services Minister Anne Ruston said on Monday, arises from the strength of the labour market, which has seen 1.5 million jobs created on the Coalition’s watch since 2013. In December, employment ­data showed unemployment edging down to 5.1 per cent. And recent jobs growth has boosted the share of working-age people who have jobs to a record 74.5 per cent. While much of the growth has been in part-time work, underemployment — the sum of the unemployment rate and the percentage of employed workers who would like to work more hours — was steady in December at 8.3 per cent.
The figures also underline the importance of Australia’s export industries. In Western Australia, for example, the end of the mining boom saw the number of welfare recipients increase by about 8000 to 210,730 over the five years to June last year.
The statistics do not reveal the full picture of reform, however. One of the most important trends in recent years has been the shift to the Newstart Allowance (with a basic rate of $559 a fortnight, and an obligation to look for work) from the more generous Disability Support Pension ($850.40 a fortnight). Slowly but surely, reform has been achieved through successive ministers — including Labor ministers in the final years of the Rudd-Gillard era — tightening eligibility for the DSP. From a peak of 793,900 recipients in 2012, when Australians seemed to be unusually prone to bad backs, chronic fatigue, “crippling’’ stress, RSI, burnout and other ills, the number of DSP recipients fell to 680,300 in mid-2018. Reform was essential. A situation in which every 14 or 15 workers were supporting a disability support pensioner was no longer sustainable.
On Thursday, we reported on a new, incremental reform to benefit 18,750 humanitarian refugees arriving each year. With data showing 77 per cent of refugees were jobless a year after arriving — and 22 per cent still jobless after a decade — the government announced English-language courses for the newcomers would be overhauled under a push to settle half of new refugees in regional areas and help them find work. A new Refugee and Migrant Services Advisory Council, to be headed by refugee advocate Paris Aristotle, with ­private-sector business leaders on board, will attempt to drive better training and employment programs. The goal is to capitalise on the skills of refugees, some of whom are highly qualified, but who lack English-language skills. Such initiatives, implemented well, are needed to improve the quality of life for refugees and to boost skills in regional areas.The government’s welfare policies are on the right track, but it has no room for complacency. This financial year, social security and welfare spending will be $180bn. The outlay swallows a third of federal revenue and is more than defence and federal health and education spending combined.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Prepare for worst before it arrives	Wanganui Chronicle	The Covid-19 pandemic is dishing out lessons for the world and offering warnings for the future.
The main one is obvious. How much cheaper, smarter and safer would it have been to prepare properly than be hit, unprotected, by a health disaster and economic shockwave?
That should underline countries’ relationships with each other and their own economic, security, and climate-change policies going forward. At international and national levels, the world can’t operate as a collective jungle where we can be savaged by wolves and only watch it happen.
Governments need to think long-term, build protective barriers into economic and working life, and treat essential services as essential. Proper funding for health and other public services should be viewed as insurance against trillion-dollar meltdowns. And probably the only way to ensure that happens globally is to tackle economic inequality to free up funds.
It’s not just pandemics. Both coronaviruses and climate change can threaten everyone: Neither respects borders nor ideologies. They demand adequate prevention strategies from governments and personal changes from people. The virus is giving the environment and wildlife a time out, in a reminder of our influence on the planet. Satellites show pollution levels have fallen in European cities as human activity stalls. US fuel consumption has fallen to a 25-year low. Social media shows videos of wild animals scoping out empty streets around the world.
The coronavirus experience is mixed news for climate change. It suggests radical change is possible if the political will is there and the public buys in. And it has reaffirmed the importance of scientific expertise.
Yet it has also exposed short-term thinking. Co-operation between countries has come late in the crisis and is inadequate. Nations are competing for everyday medical supplies. How did it come to this?
Before Covid-19, countries could have set up response teams to run national strategies; built deep stocks of their own manufactured medical supplies; had networks of companies organised for emergency production, for testing and for vaccine research.
What’s unsustainable is the world just slipping back into old ways.
We’ve seen how one pandemic can cause damage that will likely take years to recover from. We’ve seen how inadequate preparation and incompetent leadership can make a bad situation worse.
The coronavirus is in our faces. It demands attention as it unfolds. Climate change lacks that urgency for too many people and officials.
Maybe the pandemic and governments’ response will shake off that complacency.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Biden claims warrant scrutiny	The Australian	The Democrats applied different standards to Mr Trump
Sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden, the putative US Democratic presidential candidate, warrant the same scrutiny that targeted Donald Trump’s candidacy in 2016 and Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination in 2018.
It’s not good enough that Mr Biden, finding himself caught in the headlights amid allegations he molested a Senate staffer, Tara Reade, 27 years ago, has apparently gone back on the standards he demanded previously of others. “For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you’ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she’s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it’s been made worse or better over time,” he said in strongly backing the #MeToo-led campaign against Judge Kavanaugh over alleged sexual impropriety. There were no caveats then from him about the presumption of innocence or proper investigations to establish the truth.
In dismissing Ms Reade’s allegations and unequivocally insisting they “never, never happened, it’s as simple as that”, Mr Biden is singing a different tune. Asked whether “women should be believed unless it pertains to you?”, he replied: “Women have a right to be heard, and the press should rigorously investigate claims they make. But in the end, in every case, the truth is what matters.” He has also refused to open a trove of his Senate records, which could potentially contain evidence of a complaint from Ms Reade.
The cornerstone of Mr Biden’s campaign to oust Mr Trump from the White House, he claims, is to “restore the soul of America”. But the double standard and attempts at obfuscation he is showing in dealing with Ms Reade’s allegations raise doubts.In winning in 2016, Mr Trump showed that being accused of serial sexual misdemeanours is no bar to victory in US politics (he was accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women). But Mr Biden is running as the anti-Trump on character and personal probity. He leads in most major polls. But his perceived unwillingness to be fully transparent about Ms Reade’s claims is unlikely to help his prospects.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
OUR VIEW Global unity the best defence v COVID-19	The Northern Advocate	The Government’s travel restraints fit in with tough measures nations are wielding against COVID-19.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says all arrivals, including Kiwis, must self-isolate, except for people from Pacific islands. Cruise ships are banned until the end of June. Australia has largely followed suit.
The moves put health factors above all others. NZ has only a few cases but any complacency on the virus will be shaken by disruption to travel, sports and events.
Since Italy stunned the world a week ago with its lockdown, a growing number of countries have decided taking a hard line while there’s still time is the best tack.
Italy’s drastic move was an attempt to rectify a slow response which resulted in case numbers exploding — from 1128 to 17,660 — in only two weeks. Since then:
● The United States (2836 cases) has banned foreign nationals entering the US from dozens of European countries.
● Denmark (836), the Czech Republic (189), and Poland (104) have sealed their borders.
● Spain (6391) has gone into lockdown and France (4469) is closing some shops, restaurants and cinemas. Britain (1140) has banned mass gatherings.
● Belgium (689) has closed schools, bars and restaurants. Greece (228) has closed shopping centres, restaurants and bars.
● Argentina (34), Peru (38) and Colombia (22) introduced quarantines for some arrivals.
The virus has spread far since it surfaced in China. South Korea found that free testing on a massive scale, emergency alerts for the public, monitoring some arrivals and using technology to trace infectious people helped it get on top of one of the largest clusters.
As nations face a common foe, solidarity has been in short supply with a lack of obvious global co-operation and co-ordination. Former US diplomat Nicholas Burns tweeted: “President Trump needs to stop blaming the EU and China and start working with them and others on global measures.”
Common expert advice to populations and test kits from the World Health Organisation have been shared and some good ideas have crossed borders. But there have been no urgent summits or word of shared plans of attack.
As each country looks inward, self-isolates and pulls up the drawbridge, we are probably getting an ominous preview of future life in a world under siege from climate change.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Lawfare is not the path to peace	The Australian	The International Criminal Court does not have justice on its agenda
Foreign Minister Marise Payne had good reason to express Australia’s deep concern over the International Criminal Court’s ruling that it has jurisdiction over “the situation in Palestine”. As University of Wollongong law professor Greg Rose pointed out on our Commentary page on Monday, the decision presages decades of prosecutions targeted at Israeli leaders for alleged war crimes, a goal that has long been a key ambition of Palestinian leaders in their campaign against the Jewish state.
Yet it is a judgment that is based in legal fantasy land given that, as Senator Payne noted, there is no such sovereign state as “Palestine” that has rights under the 2002 Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding treaty that forms the basis on which the court may or may not take action such as that demanded by the Palestinians. Neither is Israel among the 123 countries that have signed the statute, which mandates specifically that the ICC’s jurisdiction and right to act is reserved for, and confined to, only those countries that consent to it.
In 2015, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas lodged a declaration under the Rome Statute accepting the ICC’s jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed “in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014”. He did so in a fit of pique after the rejection of a UN Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, with the US and Australia voting against.
Buoyed by the ICC’s legal acrobatics in claiming jurisdiction to act on his complaint, Mr Abbas clearly will seek to use the court’s processes to try to cause major damage to Israel. But his real aim is likely to be to bolster his attempts to achieve Palestinian statehood through the back door with recognition of it by key international bodies such as the ICC, rather than through negotiating directly with Israel. It will be a pity if the ICC allows itself to be manipulated in this way. As Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council executive director Colin Rubenstein said: “Palestine is not a state and international law should not be abused in order to manufacture one. A Palestinian state will only be created after negotiations with Israel to resolve important issues such as borders, refugees and the status of Jerusalem.” Yet implicit in the court’s 2-1 decision is acknowledgment by the ICC of Palestinian statehood.
No wonder Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted so vehemently, denouncing the decision as “refined anti-Semitism” against the Middle East’s only functioning democracy and the only country in that region where the rule of law prevails. He has a point, not least because the ICC’s judgment can be read as drawing a moral equivalence between Israel and terror groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Of course, any serious allegations against Israeli security forces ought to be investigated. As Dr Rubenstein pointed out, Israel has “an independent legal system which is quite capable of addressing any allegations of war crimes, and the ICC is only supposed to intervene where such domestic legal processes are not available. Rather than doing the bidding of Israel’s enemies, the ICC should focus on the egregious human rights breaches in Xinjiang, in Myanmar and in Iran.” That is unlikely to happen. The ICC’s Palestinian overreach was encouraged by the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation, while key Muslim-majority nations have financial interests and political calculations above solidarity with Uighur coreligionists. This is not about justice and it’s not as if the ICC has credibility to squander. As for the Palestinian cause, the only path towards harmony and prosperity for this long-suffering people is for an end to angry gestures and futile manoeuvre. Palestinians deserve a leadership with a firm grasp of what is strategically possible and unafraid to take responsibility for good-faith negotiations with Israel.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
EDITORIAL Bauer move shows NZ media in crisis	Wanganui Chronicle	The Listener magazine was founded in 1939 on the eve of World War II. It managed to survive those difficult early years of global strife. But it could not survive Covid-19.
Yesterday the 80-year-old publication abruptly closed its doors, alongside shutters being pulled at North & South, Metro, NZ Woman’s Weekly and other titles that generations of New Zealanders have grown up with as the country’s dominant magazine publisher, Bauer, shut up shop and walked away from its local business.
Against the bigger picture of the world in crisis, this is only a small story. But it is a devastating one for media in New Zealand.
Media is by no means the only industry suffering the reverberations of the Covid-19 outbreak. Aviation, tourism and education face crises on larger scales, but media is one of the only sectors to simultaneously find itself more in demand than ever — while also suddenly facing near-existential economic challenges.
The torrent of fast-breaking and hugely significant news over the past month has seen audiences flock to reliable media outlets. Readership of the NZ Herald online has at times more than doubled during that time.
But the Covid-19 crisis has seen advertising revenues, lifeblood for all media here bar RNZ, sharply decline. The media industry was already on shaky ground. The shifting of audiences online has seen advertising revenues largely hoovered up by offshore social media giants with little local responsibility or taxable presence.
Bauer’s German owners had been seeking to offload their New Zealand titles for some time. Its keystone publication, Kia Ora, faced a future as cut back as the airline it serves. The Government’s decision to not class the production of periodicals as essential in the lockdown seems to be responsible only for the suddenness of cessation.
And uncertainty of ownership was not limited to Bauer. Nine and OakTree — owners of Stuff and MediaWorks, respectively — have also been recently seeking to offload their NZ outlets.
NZME, publisher of the NZ Herald, and regional newspapers including the Whanganui Chronicle has acknowledged the current challenge to the NZX, saying it is “now seeing an impact on trading revenue due to the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic”. The company is working proactively to adapt the business to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, but earlier this week, as a direct consequence of the virus, Radio Sport ceased broadcasting.
A healthy media encourages excellence, better represents New Zealanders, and diffuses and better critiques power.
NZME will continue to strive to shed light at this difficult time, but must acknowledge there are some dark days at present.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

The torrent of fast-breaking and hugely significant news over the past month has seen audiences flock to reliable media outlets.

Iran at a dangerous crossroads	The Australian	The Middle East will be safer if the ayatollahs cannot rearm
Iran’s ruling ayatollahs would reap a substantial win if Europe refuses to support Donald Trump’s attempts to “snap back” global sanctions against the Tehran regime with its record of supporting terrorism. With China and Russia poised to supply Iran with advanced military equipment when the UN-mandated international arms embargo lapses on October 18, the UK, France and Germany, signatories to the Iran nuclear deal, need to consider US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s criticisms that their failure of leadership amount to their “siding with the ayatollahs”. Washington’s UN ambassador, Kelly Craft, has warned that “Iran’s access to combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, tanks, missile systems and other advanced weapons is about to be unlocked”. Given Iran’s aggressive intentions in Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon and Syria, the effects could be significant. It could also enhance the existential threat Iran poses to Israel.
In a UN Security Council vote last week, the UK, France and Germany declined to support a US resolution calling for an extension of the 2007 arms embargo imposed on Iran. In an embarrassing defeat, only the Dominican Republic supported Washington. China and Russia voted no but effectively received support from 11 abstaining UNSC members, including the three European signatories to the nuclear deal, as well as well as NATO ally Belgium, Estonia, Indonesia and South Africa. Mr Trump then turned to Plan B, invoking the “snapback” mechanism in the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by Barack Obama. This allows the US to insist on the immediate reimposition of sanctions if Iran is judged to be acting “in significant non-performance” of the deal. But in a decision that reveals the extent to which the Western alliance is fractured over Iran, the UK, France and Germany are refusing to support “snapback” and reject the notion that the US has a right to seek reimposition of sanctions. Western strategic interests dictate that the free world helps ensure that Iran’s malevolent rulers are prevented from getting major new weapons stockpiles.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Never waste a crisis to get economic game in order	The Australian	The Morrison government has a chance to go for growth
Treasurers can say the dopiest things. For sheer foolhardiness in the arena it would be hard to beat former Labor custodian Wayne Swan’s opening line on budget night 2012: “The four years of surpluses I announce tonight”. An ocean of red ink flowed for years. The porch light is still on for Swanny’s surplus to find its way home. Last April, Josh Frydenberg declared “the budget is back in the black and Australia is back on track”. We shall soon see whether the Treasurer got ahead of himself. Treasurers-in-waiting are not immune from sloppy talk either. Not long ago, Labor’s Jim Chalmers was claiming the economy was busted and the Morrison government needed to get over its surplus fixation and to spend. Now, after the bushfires and the coronavirus outbreak, Labor’s Treasury spokesman is a stickler for fiscal rectitude, surpluses and debt reduction.
Given the budget update’s cautious coal and iron ore price forecasts, a lower dollar, low interest rates and solid employment growth, a surplus may yet materialise. The budget is essentially in balance, a reasonable fiscal starting position if things turn for the worse. The virus outbreak is a shock to the real economy and confidence levels, from consumers to financial markets. The spending slump is being felt in tourism and education as the February 1 ban on travellers from China bites hard. With supply chains disrupted, construction, manufacturing, agriculture and retail are also experiencing difficulties. The ensuing uncertainty from the spread of COVID-19 has wiped $129bn off our stockmarket in the past three days.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome episode in 2003 can give us only a partial sense of the expected economic fallout. The good news is the rebound in China’s economy post-SARS meant we barely missed a beat after Beijing pumped up the fiscal stimulus. But China’s economy is four times larger now and enmeshed in the global trading system. The fallout is likely to be much worse, especially for us, given one-third of our exports go to China. Australia could experience negative GDP growth — that is, a fall in national output — this quarter, as well as a drop in the three months to December last year. International Monetary Fund economists pared back global GDP this year from 3.3 per cent to 3.2 per cent. Mr Frydenberg says the message from Treasury is the impact of COVID-19 will be more severe than the bushfires. Again, Scott Morrison is disinclined to panic. After all, the economy has solid foundations. “I can assure taxpayers,” the Prime Minister said, “that we’re not a government that engages in extreme fiscal responses.” Is that bravado from a former treasurer? No and yes. Mr Morrison won last May promising to run a tight budget, with tax cuts and no new taxes, and to pay down debt over the medium term. But if he thinks the economy is hunky-dory, that’s also worrying. Old-school politicians and officials, though few are on the ground these days, know the adage “never let a good crisis go to waste”. The COVID-19 outbreak is an opportunity for Mr Morrison and his team to do some home renovations and explain to the public that reforms are necessary to ensure we are prepared to meet the next crisis. As we have often argued here, that involves fixing the supply side of our economy so we can get faster GDP growth, produce more for certain levels of labour and capital, make our businesses more competitive, and reduce the hurdles they must go over to invest, innovate or negotiate with their workers.Governments should make less use of the pork barrel in target electorates and take the cost-benefit advice of the experts at bodies such as Infrastructure Australia to deliver the roads, rail, ports and water storage the nation needs. We must develop the skills base, especially in trades, if we are to be equipped to reap the benefits of mega projects such as Future Submarines. Key advisers keep arguing weak productivity growth is a drag on wages, living standards and asset values. As Mr Frydenberg frames the May budget, his advisers and message shapers will be seeking a rhetorical leap to reset the economic story. A good line or two won’t cut it. The test for the Morrison government is to look beyond this crisis, even the next election, and set out a game plan to improve the dynamism of the economy, to pare back the dead wood in the economy, including Canberra’s own footprint, and to go for growth.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Midnight knocks in China signal new era of bullying	The Australian	The Morrison government is walking a difficult tightrope Our nation’s bilateral relationship with China has deteriorated to a disturbing new low, prompting the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to judge it no longer safe for Australian journalists to work from Australia’s largest trading partner. Distinguished Australian correspondents have done so successfully to the benefit of both nations since the establishment of diplomatic relations with China in the early 1970s. As a result of the latest move, China’s government and justice system, already opaque, will now be even more so until the Chinese indicate they are willing to open up again, if they do in the foreseeable future.
Exacerbating tensions would be futile and dangerous. These are running high against the background of China’s crackdown in Hong Kong, its expansion in the South China Sea, the push to intimidate Taiwan, cyber security attacks and soft power incursions into other nations. From Australia’s perspective, the Morrison government was right to stand its ground in calling for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. Scott Morrison also has shown good judgment by moving to take control of deals with foreign powers by Australian universities and lower tiers of government. But these stances have angered China, prompting penalties on Australian exports.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying failed to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear last week when she claimed her country did its best to make all foreign journalists’ lives and work in China “as convenient as possible”. Its “best” included intimidating recent late-night visits to the homes of the ABC’s Bill Birtles and Australian Financial Review’s Michael Smith. Birtles, who was hosting farewell drinks with friends and colleagues, recounted on Tuesday after he and Smith arrived in Sydney that the officials told him he was banned from leaving the country and would be questioned over a “national security case”. Birtles stayed for four days in Australia’s embassy in Beijing while Smith took refuge in Australia’s Shanghai consulate as diplomats negotiated their safe passages.
Chinese police were reportedly within hours of arresting the journalists before they sought protection in the Australian missions. That prospect would be dire. The cruel, torturous treatment meted out to Australian-Chinese writer Yang Hengjun, who has been held in China since January last year, exemplifies what detainees can face. Yang has been charged with espionage under China’s legal and security structure.
Before flying out, Birtles and Smith were interviewed separately by China’s Ministry of State Security. Their plight was connected with the case of Beijing-based Australian journalist Cheng Lei, a popular television host on a state-controlled television network. She has been detained for “endangering China’s national security”.
The evacuation of Birtles and Smith, the last two journalists reporting full time for Australian media in China, reflects two serious problems. These are, first, the breakdown in trust in the Australia-China relationship and, second, rising concerns about the arbitrary detention of Australian citizens in China. DFAT’s Smart Traveller advisory makes it clear: “If you’re already in China, and wish to return to Australia, we recommend you do so as soon as possible by commercial means. Authorities have detained foreigners because they’re ‘endangering national security’. Australians may also be at risk of arbitrary detention.” That prospect is bad for the strong commercial relationships between Australian and Chinese companies. PwC Australia’s Asia practice leader Andrew Parker says the business community in China is asking: “Are we actually safe here now? And the question has come up in the context of Hong Kong as well.” China’s dramatic moves are not new. In March, it ordered reporters from The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal to get out. Indonesia, during the Suharto era, expelled Australian media. Five journalists were shot dead in the East Timorese border town of Balibo during the build-up to the Indonesian invasion in 1975. Part of the problem with China is that President Xi Jinping and his regime are clueless about the workings of a free press. As former China correspondent Rowan Callick writes, Mr Xi has told Chinese journalists: “Your name is Party … Wherever the readers are, wherever the viewers are, that is where propaganda reports must extend their tentacles.” In a telling statement on Tuesday, a foreign ministry spokesperson said foreign journalists in China were expected to “report according to law’’.
Foreign editor Greg Sheridan, who was The Australian’s first China correspondent in 1985, describes the current sequence of events in China as “unprecedented, bizarre, ominous and a pointer to an immediate future which is likely to become more fraught and more dangerous”. And it almost certainly indicates a further shift towards the practice of naked, brutal hostage diplomacy by Beijing. The Morrison government faces a tough balancing act. Its priority must be a firm, quiet defence of Australia’s sovereignty and national interest. It also needs to turn down the heat in what is now a “barely functioning relationship”, as Sheridan writes, with Chinese ministers still refusing to speak to their Australian counterparts. The challenge over time will be to dampen the sense of crisis and seek whatever avenues might be available to resume effective dialogue.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Powerful alliance in hard times	The Australian	The Morrison-Abe summit represented a meeting of minds
For half a century, there has been no doubt about the overwhelming importance of Australia’s close security and economic relationship with Japan. In a world under siege from COVID-19, those bilateral ties have assumed even greater importance. That was clear from last Thursday’s virtual summit between Scott Morrison and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, at which both leaders pledged to work together to help countries across the Indo-Pacific fight the scourge of the pandemic.
Their commitment to support the region, in particular our Pacific and Southeast Asian neighbours, in managing the impact of the virus when China is making cynical attempts to coax many regional nations to sign up to its so-called “Health Silk Road” was important.
Despite COVID-19’s Chinese beginnings, Beijing has been making much of what it claims will be a Chinese-led global healthcare system aimed at dominating the world — the “Health Silk Road”, linked to the coercive Belt and Road Initiative. Mr Morrison and Mr Abe provided a counter, pledging to support health security across the region and assist in economic recovery and development.
Without mentioning China by name, the leaders also challenged Beijing’s determination to keep Taiwan out of the World Health Organisation and the World Health Assembly, despite the island nation leading the world in getting to grips with COVID-19. From a population of 24 million it has had only 451 cases and seven deaths. Mr Morrison and Mr Abe rightly drew attention to the shortsighted, self-serving foolishness of keeping Taiwan out, despite its outstanding record in fighting the pandemic. Beijing’s stance reflects its malevolence towards the hugely successful country it despises.
Given the extent to which the battle against COVID-19 and China’s brazen attempts to exploit it for its own ends are affecting every country in our region, it was always going to dominate the summit. But Mr Morrison and Mr Abe were also at one in expressing “grave concern” about the draconian new security law imposed by China on Hong Kong, and its erosion of the “one country, two systems” framework.
They also reaffirmed “serious concern” about “negative developments” in the South China Sea. That included the continuing militarisation of disputed areas and “the dangerous and coercive’’ use of coastguard vessels and maritime militia to disrupt maritime exploration by regional countries. Australia and Japan restated their resolve to ensure respect for freedom of navigation and overflying rights above the South China Sea, and their determination to see that all disputes are resolved in terms of the Law of the Sea. That is a notion China finds unacceptable. The strong reaffirmation by Mr Morrison and Mr Abe of their support for the broader “Quad” strategic alliance that brings together Australia and Japan with the US and India, sent a powerful message. In an increasingly volatile region, the summit was a comprehensive meeting of minds.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
EDITORIAL National now fighting to survive	The Northern Advocate	The National Party will look to reset its election campaign under Judith Collins — their fourth leader since the Coalition Government took office.
The role of Opposition leader is an unenviable one at any time. Under the combative Westminister style of democracy, the job is to hold the Government to account. By nature, it entails carping and criticising at any potential flaw in the country’s leadership. It starts in a negative position and seldom provides the opportunity to shift on to a positive footing.
Collins is an experienced politician, comfortable in many situations, and the person many thought should have taken over the leadership after Sir Bill English. But she will have her work cut out.
By most accounts, Todd Muller is a good man. Consoling words came quickly after his resignation from all sides of the House, and are clearly sincere and heartfelt.
But as a leader, he air-balled just about every shot he was handed. As has been previously stated, he was looking for a place to put a foot right.
Muller should have moved more quickly to force the resignation of a junior MP who abused patient information. He should have been faster to provide straight answers about who knew what and when. The source of the leaked patient information, Michelle Boag, should have been summarily excised from the party.
A pending investigation by former solicitor general Mike Heron, QC, was only going to uncover more difficult questions to answer. Some have pointed to historical ploys by National as proof “dirty politics“runs deep in the party culture, and these leaked patient details as proof it thrives.
But reviewing the footage of this scandal seems to reveal less of a malevolent party machine and more of a floundering cluster of individuals in varying stages of desperation to interrupt a conversation about how well the Government is doing.
Muller’s discomfort at being questioned on the leaked patient information was visible. His diction was far from that of a consummate performer. He was evasive and only drew more scrutiny. These are not the mannerisms of a Machiavellian.
By last Wednesday, Muller stood, shoulders unabashedly slumped in front of cameras, to attempt announcing a proposed highway in Canterbury. He was peppered with questions about Boag, Walker, Michael Woodhouse and his own actions. His plea for “any questions about the road“was piteous. His road was already running out.
After just 53 days, Muller now has the record for the shortest tenure leading the National Party. English was previously the shortest, with 1 year and 77 days. Collins will know only too well there are 66 days until the election. She knows it will be a monumental task to better English’s record.
Last week, we referred to the Boag affair as “an own-goal of electorally disastrous proportions“.
This week’s capitulation now leaves the party in a fight for survival at the polls.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Staffers’ solo sex acts bring Morrison back to reality	The Australian	The PM is being called to fight on issues that suit his opponents
When Scott Morrison returned from the festive season break and thought about the year ahead, his vision would have been about how best to capitalise on the success of Australia’s pandemic response and economic bounceback, and to exploit an opposition in disarray with a leader under siege. Conventional wisdom at that time was that an election would be called sometime this year to catch the government’s opponents flat-footed. Victory at the next federal election would extend the length of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison conservative government past that achieved by John Howard. But as federal parliament prepares to conclude a tumultuous sitting this week, the Prime Minister is in a world of pain.
Despite good news on the economic front, the reform agenda on industrial relations has been surrendered in the face of partisan politics by the ALP and obstinance in the Senate. The pathway forward is much less clear because of an escalating row over allegations of sexual abuse in parliament that has spilled over into anger about the treatment of women in the community and workplace in general. Serious allegations have been made that a rape involving parliamentary staff took place two years ago in the office of the defence industry minister at the time, Linda Reynolds. Attorney-General Christian Porter has taken leave for mental health reasons after facing allegations he raped a woman 30 years ago when both were teenagers, which he denies. Those claims are now the subject of defamation proceedings between Mr Porter and the ABC.
Combined, the allegations have ignited a storm of community protest, with claims of mistreatment of women spreading to the ALP and major private firms. Mr Morrison has been under attack for having a tin ear about complaints. But the final straw came on Tuesday with reports Coalition staff had filmed themselves masturbating on the desks of MPs and shared the images online. There are allegations of prostitutes being taken into Parliament House for a former MP. All up, it paints the picture of a workplace out of control and, as the most senior person in the building, and the nation, Mr Morrison is being called to take responsibility. In an emotional press conference on Tuesday, Mr Morrison said he was “shocked”, “completely stunned” and “disgusted” by the “disgraceful behaviour” that had been exposed. Things that were done, he said, “are just so foreign to me that I can hardly process them”. Mr Morrison’s plea was to “put the politics aside on these things and we must recognise this problem, acknowledge it, and we must fix it”. “This is not something that is of a scale that any government can simply change, it is something we must change as a society because we know it happens all over this country,” the Prime Minister said.
The media verdict inside Parliament House was that Mr Morrison was attempting to reset the conversation on women. Political reporter Rosie Lewis said many would say it was too late and the damage to his government was already done. Associate editor Helen Trinca cast the convulsions as a reanimation of the women’s liberation push after a period in which younger women thought that all the battles had been won. “It’s been both thrilling and confronting,” Trinca wrote.
Mr Morrison is correct that this is a battle that extends well beyond the highly irregular working conditions and power dynamics inside Parliament House. In recent years sex scandals have claimed the scalps of a host of well-known and powerful corporate chiefs. The most recent examples of male staff in parliament sharing images of themselves indulging in solo sex acts on the desks of female MPs shines a light into an element of culture that might seem incomprehensible to older generations. Sending lewd images is behaviour that parents of teenage sons and daughters know well is not confined to high office. But none of this will let Mr Morrison off the hook.
Mr Morrison told Coalition staff on Tuesday they would undertake mandatory face-to-face workplace health and safety training in response to the inappropriate behaviour and sexual assault allegations. The government will establish a register for staff induction and professional conduct across all ministerial offices. It also will implement a Coalition human resources team to promote best practice and provide guidance for staff. Given the human resources requirements placed on private sector workplaces, many would think it extraordinary these measures were not already in place for the major parties. Where Mr Morrison has struggled to outline a coherent strategy to get back on to the front foot, Greens senator Larissa Waters on Tuesday listed the demands that will take government focus away from success with COVID-19 and the economic recovery. They include that the commonwealth immediately fully fund all frontline domestic violence and sexual assault services, legislate to end the gender pay gap, strengthen sexual harassment laws, make early childhood education free and build social housing. Mr Morrison says he is in favour of more women in senior conservative ranks, including a quota system. But from a position of strength at the start of the parliamentary term the Prime Minister is being called to fight on terms that better suit his political opponents.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL BY ILONA HANNE How big is your bubble really?	Wanganui Chronicle	The Prime Minister has asked us to all act us as though we already have Covid-19.
If we do that, she argues, then we will be more inclined to avoid unnecessary contact with others, enabling New Zealand to stamp out the spread of the virus as quickly as possible.
So, now over halfway into lockdown, I ask you — are you doing that?
If you were to be tested and found to have the virus today, how many phone calls would the health board have to make to contacts of yours?
Would it be just your immediate bubble who would need to watch for symptoms? Or would the neighbour you talked to over the fence need to watch too? Not if you followed the rules of course, but did you really? Or did you lean on that fence, touching the rail your neighbour would also have touched?
Would you have to contact the people across your street, who have that dog you pat every day?
Does your friend need to be on the list too? You know the one, you sat on her sofa this week for a quick catch up. “But it was okay, she sat on the other side of the room, so we were far enough apart ... ”
What about every person on your street? When you joined in that clever “socially distant street party”? Of course, you followed the rules, every household brought their own chairs, parked them at the end of their driveway a good two metres away from the next house ... Just a shame you all shared the same table to put the snacks on, and the same chilly bin to store the beers in ...
Or what about your biking club friend. The one you cleverly texted so you could cycle the same route at the same time. Two metres apart of course, other than when you had to close in because a car was coming ... but that didn’t matter right? You are both healthy after all ...
Would the warning the health board put out be just for shoppers on one day at your local supermarket? Or have you been there every day this week?
This lockdown isn’t about working your way around the rules, it is about following them, even when it is inconvenient. Sure, you might run out of a couple of handy pantry items in the middle of the week, but so are lots of people. Not all of whom instantly run off to the supermarket to get more. They do without until their next big shop.
People are dying of Covid-19, but to my knowledge, no one is dying of having to cope without their favourite biscuits for a few days.
So stop trying to be clever, and stop thinking the rules don’t apply to you. Follow the rules like everyone else is and please, act like you already have Covid-19.
Any other behaviour just shows you have been infected with the Covidiot strain instead.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL GFC-era $30b spending spree	The Daily Post	The Reserve Bank has embarked on a global financial crisis-era quantitate easing programme, designed to help support the economy as it grapples with Covid-19.
It will pump an extra $30 billion into the economy by buying Government-backed bonds, held by investors and retail banks across the country.
This is an unconventional monetary policy tool used by central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, in the 2008/09 financial crisis.
It is also referred to as quantitative easing — it has never been done before in New Zealand.
Yesterday, the central bank announced it would begin what is called a large scale asset purchasing programme (LSAP) in which it will buy Government bonds.
The move comes just a week after the Reserve Bank lowered the official cash rate (OCR) by 0.75 per cent to just 0.25 per cent.
“This is part of our strategy to mobilise all arms of New Zealand’s economic infrastructure in our fight against the Covid-19 virus,” Finance Minister Grant Robertson said.
It’s a move, Robertson said, that would support the economy by reducing longer-term interest rates.
He said it would lead to lower costs for businesses and mortgage holders, and a lower currency to help New Zealand exporters.
“We are all uniting together — the Government, the Reserve Bank, private businesses and the retail banks — to cushion the impact on New Zealand from this global pandemic.”
The Reserve Bank will buy $30 billion of Government bonds over the next 12 months.
In a statement yesterday, the Reserve Bank noted that the severity of the impacts on the New Zealand economy has increased.
“The negative economic implications of the coronavirus outbreak have continued to intensify.”
The central bank’s move will be welcomed by economists, who have been calling for the Reserve Bank to implement a quantitative easing programme.
“A move to large-scale asset purchases [quantitative easing] is needed very urgently,” ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner said last week.
“It needs to be large given how dysfunctional markets are at present.”
Robertson noted that the quantitative easing programme was a decision made by the Reserve Bank. But, because the Reserve Bank is part of the Crown’s balance sheet, it is necessary for an indemnity to be signed by the Minister of Finance.
The move does not affect core Crown net debt, or the Government’s operating balance other than reducing finance costs for the Government’s borrowing programme, Robertson said.

Putin’s push: president for life	The Australian	The Russian referendum is a distortion of democracy Vladimir Putin remaining in power for another 16 years — until he is 83 — is a disturbing prospect. That is what Russia’s 110 million voters are being asked to approve in the current week-long referendum. The proposal for an extended presidential term for the former KGB colonel, in power for two decades, is tucked away in a single sentence of near incomprehensible legal jargon in voting material.
Polls show Mr Putin’s popularity has fallen to historic lows during COVID-19. About 630,000 Russians have been infected, 9000 have died and millions have lost jobs. Private polling shows popular opposition to the biggest constitutional overhaul since the end of the Soviet Union, but that is not inhibiting his determination to effectively become president for life.
Voting is like a tawdry TV game show, with voters going into draws to win cars, washing machines, hairdryers and fluffy cats, and even one-bedroom apartments are being offered to those who vote for Mr Putin. Such bribery symbolises the unrelenting undermining of democratic processes in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet regime. Corruption has flourished. Russia ranks 137 out of 180 in Transparency International’s 2019 Index, a regression from 82 when Mr Putin took office. He is at an awkward juncture. He believes he cannot afford to lose office lest he lose his protection against enemies he has made and the power to keep his business and political cronies enriched. Given his control of most media and his suppression of any sign of opposition, he is set to emerge victorious. But Russia and the world deserve better than a leader who cynically manipulates political processes and was callously dishonest about his illegal invasion of Crimea and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. Donald Trump has suggested expanding the G7 group of leading economies to include Australia, India and South Korea. He also wants Russia returned to full membership, from which it was expelled over Crimea. He should think again. Under Mr Putin’s corrupt, authoritarian rule, Russia does not belong at democracy’s top table.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Union ideology threatens wage subsidies amid crisis	The Australian	The Senate, by blocking JobKeeper, would harm workers
Given the importance of its $130bn JobKeeper wage subsidy to workers, employers and the shell-shocked economy, the Morrison government needs to put the initiative into effect sooner rather than later. The best time to trigger the starting gun will be on Wednesday in parliament, as Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter said on Sunday. At a challenging economic time brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, that has been rivalled only by the Depression and World War II, the opposition, the Greens and Senate crossbenchers should put the national interest first by backing the necessary changes to the Fair Work Act. The alternative, favoured by the ACTU and Labor, would be for the government to work through the Fair Work Commission to change 121 awards and 11,000 enterprise agreements over the next few weeks and months. Mr Porter, reasonably, regards that approach as untenable and too slow. Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox agrees. Addressing the issue through variations to awards and enterprise agreements was impractical, he said on Sunday. The deadlock over the best mechanism for implementing JobKeeper payments, which was revealed by Paul Kelly on Saturday, needs to be resolved as soon as possible.
So far during the COVID-19 pandemic, the ACTU has worked constructively with the Coalition and employers. Labor, generally, has adopted a sensible bipartisan approach to major issues. But the labour movement’s ideological preference to block even temporary changes to the Fair Work Act (Mr Porter has promised to include a six-month sunset clause) must not be allowed to stand between six million workers, their employers and a $1500-a-fortnight lifeline.
ACTU secretary Sally McManus, while ardently opposed to temporary amendments to the Fair Work Act, told the ABC’s Insiders on Sunday that it had taken “about a week’’ to alter awards covering hospitality, restaurant and clerical workers. That admission indicated just how slow the unions’ preferred approach would be. Ms McManus also complained that 1.1 million casual workers who had been with their employers for less than 12 months would miss out. But the government has not left any Australian bereft of support during the crisis. And taxpayers are not a bottomless pit. Ms McManus also expressed fears about employers taking advantage of temporary changes to the Fair Work Act to force workers to take all their holidays. In current circumstances, frankly, where preserving jobs and ensuring as many businesses as possible survive, a modicum of extra flexibility for employers would be sensible and practical. Mr Porter has undertaken to work through the legislation “line by line” with the ACTU to assure unions there would be no rorting of the scheme by employers. For their part, employers told The Australian that the temporary changes to the Fair Work Act needed to be put in place to give businesses the discretion to retain as many jobs as possible. Unions, Labor and crossbenchers would be foolish to stand in the way of a rescue subsidy that has attracted overwhelming support among Australians of all political persuasions — 86 per cent of the population, according to Monday’s Newspoll. The poll also shows people are thinking beyond the immediate crisis. Apart from fear of catching the virus, Australians’ biggest concern is the debt being accumulated.
As Ben Packham writes on Monday, Josh Frydenberg’s success in striking a deal with banks to lend businesses the cost of their wages bill until the $130bn JobKeeper scheme kicks in on May 1 has further increased pressure on Labor and crossbenchers to drop their threats to vote down key aspects of the mechanism for delivering the scheme. The Treasurer’s deal will see as many as six million workers begin receiving subsidised pay as early as this week. It will help businesses at the margins stay afloat and pay their workers while awaiting the $1500 fortnightly subsidy.Under its mammoth response to COVID-19, the government’s flat-rate wage subsidy is more egalitarian than overseas schemes that are based on fixed percentages of existing salaries. Enacting our scheme will test the political maturity of all sides this week. Proposing constructive improvements would make sense. Unnecessary delays would cost jobs. All sides must also remember it will be vital to wind the scheme back as soon as the economy starts emerging from hibernation.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
A quality nominee, on merit	The Australian	The Supreme Court will be a major issue in the campaign
In an impressive speech at the White House on Saturday, judge Amy Coney Barrett emphasised her view that “a judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold”. Her judicial philosophy, developed under her mentor, the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked more than 20 years ago, should reassure Americans about her suitability to serve on the same bench.
One of Judge Barrett’s colleagues from that era, Harvard Law professor Noah Feldman, an avowed liberal who disagrees with her judicial philosophy, recalled she stood out among a group of 30 clerks, “all of whom had graduated at the top of their law school classes’’. Measured by pure legal acumen, she “was one of the two strongest lawyers … when assigned to work on an extremely complex, difficult case … I would first go to Barrett to explain it to me’’.
Judge Barrett is an eminent jurist in the tradition of Justice Scalia, who, despite being a conservative, had a close friendship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court’s leading liberal who died last week. On Saturday, Judge Barrett paid a generous tribute to Justice Ginsburg, who began her career at a time when women were not welcome in the legal profession and “smashed’’ glass ceilings.
But with political passions running high 36 days from the US election, it is unlikely Donald Trump’s nomination will be treated with the “respect and dignity” he wants. An almighty political battle is likely even before Senate confirmation hearings begin. Ahead in the polls by 7 per cent, Joe Biden’s Democrats are determined to fight tooth and nail to derail her nomination and a 6-3 conservative majority on the bench. That could have an immediate impact if the election result is disputed and ends up in the court. It creates a dilemma for Mr Biden. If his opposition is too strident, it will energise Mr Trump’s base like little else.
As Gerard Baker wrote in The Wall Street Journal, millions of voters swallowed their distaste for Mr Trump in 2016 because they believed their voices had too often been ignored. And decisions by the liberal-controlled Supreme Court were central to that alienation. The lawmaking of activist judges in areas once decided by voters deepened the impression that unaccountable elites make the rules a nation of “deplorables’’ must live by. Much has been made of the fact Judge Barrett, 48, is a Catholic mother of seven. Nominated by Mr Trump to the Court of Appeals in 2017, she was confirmed after contentious hearings. Asked if her religion would intrude on her legal decisions, she replied: “It’s never appropriate for a judge to impose the judge’s personal convictions, whether they derive from faith or anywhere else, on the law.” With Republicans controlling the Senate, there is little doubt Judge Barrett will be approved and the Supreme Court will get its strongest conservative majority since the Nixon administration in the 1970s, which could endure for decades, with a profound impact. As former Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney — no friend of Mr Trump’s — said in supporting the nomination, “my liberal friends have over many decades gotten very used to the idea of a liberal court, but that’s not written in the stars. It is appropriate for a nation that is centre-right to have a court which reflects centre-right points of view”.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Don’t drop the uni bar for girls	The Australian	The T20 final won legions of new fans to women’s cricket
Kate Hadwen, principal of Pymble Ladies College, one of the nation’s top schools, is correct in her condemnation of the University of Technology Sydney’s decision to lower entry standards for female students who want to study STEM courses. On Saturday, Dr Hadwen described the move as “outrageous’’. Australia needs more STEM students and science professionals. But the UTS decision is insulting to clever, hardworking girls aspiring to careers in science, maths, engineering and IT. They are capable of making their way on merit. The move is also unfair to boys, who could miss out on places as girls enter courses with 10 fewer Australian Tertiary Admission Rank points. Such sexist mollycoddling is counter to the spirit of International Women’s Day, which saw the achievements of women celebrated around the world on Sunday.For Australian cricket fans, the highlight of the day was our women’s team’s convincing victory in the T20 World Cup final, their fifth Cup triumph. In 1988, only 3000 people turned up when Australia beat England in the same event. On Sunday, 86,174 people packed the MCG — Australia’s largest-ever crowd for a women’s sporting event. The game’s quality and excitement more than justified the “Fill the MCG” campaign. Millions around the world were also watching. Some attended or tuned in out of curiosity. But by the eighth over of Australia’s innings, when Alyssa Healy pounded successive 6s, newbie spectators had become converts. The Australians’ stroke play, bowling and catching were outstanding. After a spate of injuries early in the series, the Aussies’ victory showed talent and resilience and took the game to a new level of interest. The win was a great celebration of International Women’s Day.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Middle East’s intractable divide	The Australian	The Trump plan is a start, but Palestinians will not play ball
Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan is far from the “deal of the century”, as the US President’s hyperbole suggests. Neither is it the “slap of the century”, as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas claims. And Mr Abbas, in boycotting the process, has himself to blame for its shortcomings from a Palestinian perspective. The plan, lauded as a “win-win opportunity for both sides” by Mr Trump, is more pro-Israel than previous US peace plans dating back to Oslo Accords in 1993. But the 80-page Peace to Prosperity blueprint is more thoughtful and offers more concessions to Palestinians than was anticipated.
The plan holds the promise of Palestinian statehood in four years; it more than doubles the territory under Palestinian control and it confirms that the future Palestinian capital would be in “parts of East Jerusalem”. In return, the Palestinians would be expected to renounce terrorism and halt the activities of terrorist groups such as Islamic Jihad and Hamas. The latter, funded heavily by Iran, controls Gaza. Palestinians also would be required to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Given the refusal of Mr Abbas and his colleagues to have anything to do with the Trump administration since the US’s 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, they are likely to refuse.
To allow for negotiations, the plan calls for a four-year freeze on the construction of Israeli settlements. But the proviso that “no Palestinians or Israeli will be uprooted from their homes” suggests existing Jewish settlements in the West Bank would remain. Israel would be allowed to annex up to a third of the West Bank. But the Palestinians would receive land swaps and $US50bn ($74bn) worth of investment, and would be allowed a form of demilitarised self-rule. Gaza and the West Bank would be linked by high-speed rail. The plan would give Israel sovereignty over the hill known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. But Israel would work with the king of Jordan to preserve the status quo governing the holy site.
While far short of what the Palestinians demand, the plan would serve as a starting point. This is why Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have welcomed it as a basis for ending six years of paralysis and resuming negotiations, that were suspended by Mr Abbas in 2014 during Barack Obama’s presidency. In the interim, offers by Israel of negotiations without preconditions have been ignored.Mr Trump’s plan has the backing of Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz, who could be Israel’s leader after the March 2 election. But it has drawn the condemnation of Iran, Turkey and Jordan. Even among supporters, political hardheads are highly sceptical, for good reason, that the plan will progress the current stalemate. Too often in the past, peace and pragmatism appeared anathema to the Palestinians’ DNA. In 2000, Bill Clinton brokered a deal in which Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister at the time, offered an independent state in all of Gaza and 95 per cent of the West Bank, with Israeli territory to be relinquished for the remaining 5 per cent. Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yasser Arafat, unwilling to give up the struggle against Israel, rejected it. Palestinians followed up with a four-year suicide-bombing campaign against Israeli civilians. Twenty years on, the conflict remains seemingly intractable.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
New year, new opportunities	The Australian	The UK-EU deal should be a positive for major exporting nations
As Trade Minister Dan Tehan notes, Boris Johnson’s historic success in finally bedding down a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, ahead of the December 31 deadline, opens up important opportunities for Australia. The doomsayers maintained it could not be done but 4½ years after the referendum in which British voters unequivocally expressed their wish to reclaim their country’s sovereignty from the Brussels bureaucracy, the British Prime Minister has delivered. The road has been rocky but British voters finally have what they supported. Mr Johnson, to his credit, has succeeded while dealing with the immense challenges the UK faces with the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic.
The trade deal is testimony to his unrelenting determination to keep Britain trading with Europe, despite leaving the EU. The country is also free now to strike independent trade deals with countries such as Australia and the US. This changed global trade environment, at a time when nations are seeking to rebuild post-COVID, provides Australia’s negotiators with a renewed urgency to achieve the free-trade agreements they have been working on with Britain and the EU. They should lose no time in finalising them.
The breakthrough comes as Australia is intent on diversifying export markets. Trade conflict with the Chinese leadership is deepening, with China apparently prepared to leave citizens shivering below freezing for want of electricity powered by our coal.
Mr Johnson has made it clear he wants to nail down free-trade deals with the US and Australia as soon as possible after the start of the new year, which will mark the end of the transition phase of Brexit. He missed the chance to strike a deal with the Trump administration and will now have to wait until the new Biden team is in place.
The UK already is Australia’s seventh-largest trading partner, with two-way goods and services trade valued at $30.3bn in 2018-19. The UK is also Australia’s second-largest source of foreign investment. Even with a new free-trade agreement, Australian agricultural exports to the UK are unlikely to reach the levels they achieved before Britain joined the EU in 1973 and high tariffs and trade barriers were imposed upon Australia. But as the China door closes, at least for now, opportunities will open up in the UK and the EU for wine, beef and other primary exports currently being red-carded by Chinese malevolence.
In the free-trade agreement with the UK being negotiated, Australia is seeking rules that increase opportunities for Australian businesses investing in the UK market. These were not available while the UK was a member of the EU. The deal will also ease rules for UK investment here. Australia, concurrently, is negotiating a free-trade deal with the EU, our third-largest trading partner and source of foreign investment, with two-way trade valued at $75bn in 2019. A free-trade agreement would enhance opportunities for Australian goods and services in a 27-nation market of more than 450 million people.
In Britain’s protracted negotiations, Mr Johnson did not secure everything he promised in the 2016 referendum, but he has succeeded where Theresa May failed abysmally. The 1246-page agreement with the EU will allow Britain tariff- and quota-free access to the EU’s single market for goods. This will not, Mr Johnson conceded, be frictionless. There will be new Customs and regulatory checks that will lead to disruption at the border. British passport holders will face checks and controls, including the need for visas when visiting Europe. He also had to give ground on the EU being allowed to fish in British waters. There will be a goods border in the Irish Sea between Britain and Northern Ireland. This is because the deal keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market, preventing a hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The downsides do not detract from the importance of restoring British sovereignty and freeing the UK from Brussels’ diktat. December 31 will see the UK regain the ability to set its own labour, environmental and other regulations, without Brussels’ interference. It will see the end of interference by the European Court of Justice in British judicial decisions, which caused widespread outrage, as did the stream of EU citizens such as Romanians migrating to the UK, and the tendency of illegal immigrants from outside Europe to take advantage of relaxed EU borders to slip from nations such as Italy into Britain. Such issues were keenly resented in Britain, and contributed much to the Brexit vote result.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Trump’s address, what a ripper	The Australian	The US President’s revival casts Democrats as destroyers
US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s boorish disregard for longstanding convention in ripping up Donald Trump’s State of the Union address says much about the frustration Democrats feel after their beleaguered party’s embarrassing debacle in the Iowa caucuses. But her deplorable display of rudeness is unlikely to do much to dent the strong case Mr Trump made for another four years in the White House. The President is never reticent when it comes to hyperbole. Even his most committed adversaries will find it hard, however, to argue against his assertion that after three years of what he calls the great American comeback, “Jobs are booming. Incomes are soaring. Poverty is plummeting. Crime is falling. Confidence is surging. And our country is thriving and highly respected again! America’s enemies are on the run, America’s fortunes are on the rise, and America’s future is blazing bright.” He was always going to use the address — his third — to launch his campaign for re-election on November 3. It has to be seen as the opening shots in the campaign. Ms Pelosi’s display of pettiness and the ill-will between them notwithstanding (he declined to shake hands with her), it says much about the President’s optimism that he felt able to deliver such a buoyant assessment of his achievements in a bitterly divided House of Representatives which, under her leadership, made him only the third US president to be impeached.
Anyone who thought Mr Trump would be cowed or chastened was, however, always going to be wrong. On the eve of his acquittal by the US Senate of all the charges brought by Ms Pelosi and her colleagues, a new Gallup poll showed his approval rating among all voters at 49 per cent, the highest of his presidency; his approval among Republicans is at a remarkable 94 per cent. Support even among independent voters is up 5 per cent. So much for the Democrats’ impeachment gambit. Unlike Bill Clinton in 1999 after he was impeached over Monica Lewinsky, Mr Trump carefully avoided saying anything about impeachment or Ukraine, treating it with the disdain he has adopted from the time Ms Pelosi launched her campaign to short-circuit his presidency. He was right to do so. Despite his many flaws, Mr Trump, as his address showed, has much to skite about as he sets about seeking re-election. As he said, “in just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back.” Mr Trump boasted the US economy “is the best it has ever been”. He said the nation’s military is “completely rebuilt, with its power unmatched anywhere in the world”. US borders were secure and American families flourishing. “Our values are renewed,” he said to cheers. “Our pride is restored. And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country: The state of our union is stronger than ever before.” The contrast with his inauguration address in 2017 when he spoke of “American carnage” in articulating his case to “Make America Great” was telling. Such an exposition of achievement — creating seven million new jobs, getting wages growth of 16 per cent for low-paid workers, and seeing stockmarkets soar by 70 per cent — is one Democrats will have a hard time countering.Democrats are unlikely to have much hope against Mr Trump until they recognise the centrality of the economy. As well, their chaos in Iowa shows the extent of their disarray. That an inexperienced former local mayor, Pete Buttigieg, and leftist candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren took the first three spots underlines the party’s woes. Mr Trump is benefiting from growing confidence among voters about the economy. Support for impeachment is in sharp decline. Caution is needed, of course. When things are going well for him, Mr Trump frequently shoots himself in the foot. But he has kept his promises. The final irony for Ms Pelosi will be if it turns out that her miscalculation over impeachment, and her shameful behaviour during the State of the Union, help him win in November.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Allies show their hand on China	The Australian	The US sees through Beijing’s divisive politics and supports Australia
Britain’s strategic pivot to the Indo-Pacific, announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday, sends a message that leaders in Beijing would be sensible not to ignore. So does the statement by Dr Kurt Campbell, President Biden’s top policy “tsar” in the region, that the US will not be prepared to consider any improvement in its relations with China until it stops its attempts to coerce and bully Australia. According to Dr Campbell, Mr Biden has advised the Chinese communist regime that “we are not going to leave Australia alone on the field”. The US President is said to have told Scott Morrison during last weekend’s summit of leaders from the four Quad countries — the US, Australia, Japan and India — that “we are not prepared to take substantial steps to improve relations (with Beijing) … until a more normal interplay between Canberra and Beijing is established”. Mr Biden has made it clear he is, for the time being, maintaining all the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump.
For China, as it seeks an end to the debilitating trade wars and tensions initiated by Mr Trump’s imposition of $US360bn ($465bn) in tariffs on Chinese goods, the significance of Mr Biden’s statement cannot be overstated. Yet on Wednesday, official spokesmen in Beijing insisted that the “root cause” of the deteriorating relationship with Australia was “Australia’s wrong words and issues concerning China’s sovereignty, security and development interests which have undermined the foundation of mutual trust and co-operation between the two countries. The Australian side knows the ins and outs better than most”. That is no answer to the Biden administration’s welcome stand in defence of Australia as a close ally. Neither does it show any understanding of the important rationale underpinning the Johnson government’s pivot to the Indo-Pacific. As Greg Sheridan pointed out on Wednesday, the British move is a further sign of growing closeness among the Five Eyes nations (the US, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand) on China. Mr Biden has made it clear the key difference between his policy on China and Mr Trump’s is multilateral consensus about how to handle Beijing’s bad behaviour and challenge to the rules-based world order, rather than going it alone in a bilateral trade war. The British regional pivot adds important heft to that multilateralism. So does Mr Biden’s commendable stance in making any improvement in US relations with Beijing contingent on President Xi Jinping being more sensible about Australia.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL Bubble good news but still a way to go	Wanganui Chronicle	The announcement quarantine-free travel between New Zealand and Australia will start on April 19 has sent shivers of excitement through our sectors suffering severe ostracisation.
It’s not an instant fix but it does provide some certainty, particularly for hospitality and tourism operators. Aussies made up 40per cent of our international guests pre-Covid, spending $2.7b in 2019.
Travellers will have to bear the potential costs in mind. Should an outbreak occur, they may be locked down where they are, or borders closed to prevent their return. For this reason, among others, many in the traditional tourist trade are likely to take a wait-and-see stance for a time.
Only those who can afford to be locked in another location for an indefinite period, and perhaps able to work remotely, will consider the recreational rewards worth the risk.
Rather than a torrent of tourists then, there is more likely to be a steady flow of family and dear friends reunited.
The heartstrings will pull these people to traverse the bubble much more so than the need to ski or rest up in our verdant isles.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says: “One sacrifice that has been particularly hard for many to bear over the past year has been the separation from friends and family who live in Australia.”
“The bubble will give our economic recovery a boost and represents a world-leading arrangement of safely opening up international travel while continuing to pursue a strategy of elimination and keeping the virus out.”
All this is true, although so too is the fact that the virus continues to pepper our shield.
It’s also true that we cannot wait for herd immunity.
It is becoming increasingly apparent our vaccination rollout is lacklustre. Almost all countries are setting a vaccination target – usually 70per cent of the adult population – and a date for achieving it. But not, so far, New Zealand.
Even when reaching the perceived salvation of massed vaccination, there are still good reasons for caution and heightened wariness.
One new coronavirus variant sweeping through Brazil, and spreading to other nations around the world, is proving to be up to three times more deadly for young people, according to research.
It is also spreading more quickly among younger people, with cases among Brazilians in their 30s, 40s, and 50s are up by 565per cent, 626per cent and 525per cent respectively since the beginning of January, according to Brazilian health authorities.

EDITORIAL David Clark’s Covid-19 clangers	Wanganui Chronicle	The apologies have been profuse from our Minister of Health after he — belatedly — admitted breaches of the level 4 restrictions intended to reduce the impact of a Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic.
David Clark was summarily stripped of his Front Bench ranking for driving his family 20km to a beach to go for a walk — a breach for which the Prime Minister conceded he would, in normal circumstances, be sacked.
“At a time when we are asking New Zealanders to make historic sacrifices, I’ve let the team down. I’ve been an idiot,” Clark, 47, said. In this, at least, he’s not wrong. His earlier admission of driving his MP’s vehicle more than 2km to cycle on a mountain bike trail was already one strike.
Rather than sack him immediately, Jacinda Ardern demoted the wayward member for Dunedin North to the bottom of the Cabinet drawer and stripped him of his Associate Finance portfolio.
He has remained in the Health Minister’s post only because removing him would disrupt our response to the coronavirus.
“He’s paid a personal price,” Ardern said, “I am adamant our health system will not.”
Few would not concede there is unprecedented pressure on our officials in this time of crisis.
The requirements this situation demands would be beyond anything anyone would have anticipated even a few weeks ago.
Clark’s desire for exercise must have been enticing for a former cyclist and ironman. But he would have well known that others were also itching to stretch their legs.
The timing could have not been worse for Ardern.
As Herald columnist Matthew Hooton pointed out before the beach soiree came to light — “we are ... hearing a bit less from the Prime Minister about being kind and a bit more about arrests”.
Hooton also noted Ardern would have been keen to send a message to those who are following orders that their sacrifices are appreciated, and defectors are not.
The fact is, not disciplining Clark would make it very difficult for our authorities to discipline anyone else.
The stakes render Clark’s actions inexcusable and Ardern’s hand was forced.
The whole episode is particularly disappointing for the former Presbyterian minister and Treasury analyst, who had previously distinguished himself well and showed much more promise.
It would take Clark an extraordinary amount of contrition and dedication to rise again in Cabinet — so much so that it would seem most unlikely.
Be that as it may, for the potential he still has to contribute to fighting this virus, and for the nation’s future, it’s to be hoped he brings his attentions back into focus immediately.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL David Clark’s Covid-19 clangers	The Northern Advocate	The apologies have been profuse from our freewheeling Minister of Health after he – somewhat belatedly – admitted repeated breaches of the level 4 restrictions intended to reduce the impact of a Covid-19 pandemic.
Yesterday, David Clark was summarily stripped of his Front Bench ranking for driving his family 20km to a beach to go for a walk in the first weekend of the lockdown – a breach for which the Prime Minister conceded he would, in normal circumstances, be sacked.
“At a time when we are asking New Zealanders to make historic sacrifices, I’ve let the team down. I’ve been an idiot,” Clark, 47, said in a statement. In this, at least, he’s not wrong. His earlier admission of driving his overtly visible MP’s vehicle more than 2km to cycle on a mountain bike trail during the lockdown was already one strike.
Rather than sack him immediately, Jacinda Ardern demoted the wayward member for Dunedin North to the bottom of the Cabinet drawer and stripped him of his Associate Finance portfolio.
He has remained in the Health Minister’s post only because removing him would disrupt our response to the coronavirus.

EDITORIAL Maxwell case will make some nervous	Hawkes Bay Today	The arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell is both a key development in an unusual legal case and an illustration of the perils of high-risk connections in the social media age.
Maxwell, a former manager and girlfriend to financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was arrested in New Hampshire nearly a year after Epstein died in a police cell.
Epstein, who knew many famous people from the political, science, entertainment and business worlds – including two US presidents and a British royal – was awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.
Prosecutors in New York claim Maxwell recruited teenage girls, whom Epstein allegedly abused. She has been charged with sex crimes and perjury.
Maxwell, who denies involvement in any crimes, is a key figure considering the offences alleged and the high-profile people the pair socialised with.
Old photographs have emerged in the past few days of Maxwell and Epstein with US President Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein, and Maxwell at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding.
The Daily Telegraph ran a photograph of Maxwell and actor Kevin Spacey sitting in the throne room at Buckingham Palace in 2002. It was reportedly taken during a private tour organised by the Duke of York for former US President Bill Clinton.
Prince Andrew is under pressure from New York prosecutors seeking information about his friendship with Epstein, and specifically about claims made by an alleged victim. A formal request for the Duke to speak to them has now been made. He denies wrongdoing.
Maxwell, the daughter of former British media mogul Robert Maxwell, has known the Duke for years and introduced him to Epstein.
In some ways the case is a glimpse into the networking ways of the elite, wealthy, influential and powerful. Names and money open doors in such circles and bridge normal political tribalism. But in the social media era, evidence of links to someone accused of serious crimes can immediately be spread to millions of strangers, sometimes without context.
Reputations can quickly be tarnished by any such connection, whether that is fair or not. The meeting may have been years ago. The person being judged may not have known of any dubious behaviour.
SpaceX founder Elon Musk quickly denied knowing Maxwell after a photo surfaced from a 2014 Oscars party, claiming “she photobombed me once”.
Generally, the amplification of opinions, consumer clout and activism through social media these days has personal, social, political, and business consequences.
Maxwell’s arrest will be making a number of people nervous. Her case, like Epstein’s was, is being handled by the Southern District of New York’s Public Corruption Unit. It deals with fraud, political corruption and organised crime. There may still be bigger fish to fry than Maxwell.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Christmas shines in tough times	The Australian	The authentic messages of the season are needed more than ever However different Christmas Day will be for millions of people across the world, the differences between this and other years will make the essence of the day no less authentic. Some Christmas carols and cards — as Adelaide Archbishop Geoffrey Smith, the Anglican Primate of Australia, says in his Christmas message — give the impression that all was peaceful and calm for the birth of Christ. In reality, Archbishop Smith points out, it was the opposite. “We might be conscious we are living in uncertain times, but the context of Jesus’s birth was full of uncertainty. Palestine was oppressed by the occupying Roman empire. Various parties within Judaism were jockeying for influence and enthusiastically trying to recruit people to their cause … Bethlehem at the time of the birth of Jesus was a place of hardship, confusion and tension.’’ The first Christmas was fraught with unexpected difficulties. Mary, due to give birth to Jesus, was on the road from Nazareth with husband Joseph. In response to an edict from the Roman authorities, they were going to Bethlehem to be registered. Unable to find room at any inn, they bedded down in a stable. There the baby was born and placed in an animal feeding trough. It would have been frustrating, lonely and frightening for any couple. Shortly after the birth, Sydney’s Catholic Archbishop Anthony Fisher notes in his Christmas message, the family fled for their lives. There was a price on the baby’s head. Then, as now, unrest and uncertainty were rife in the world. Three wise men, Matthew’s Gospel relates, followed a dazzling star to find the child and bring him gifts. By coincidence, as we reported on Wednesday, Monday’s solstice brought a rare alignment of Jupiter and Saturn, the closest for centuries. It prompted astronomers to speculate whether it was similar to the “Star of Bethlehem’’.
Even with Sydney’s northern beaches outbreak, Australians are better off than most people in the world this year, especially our friends and family in Britain and Europe. In London, battened down against a more contagious strain of the virus, many will spend the day alone in small flats. Carols played over loudspeakers from closed local churches are the only hint of Christmas. In the winter drizzle, the music draws people out, under umbrellas, to listen and sing behind masks, waving to neighbours from a distance. But many Australians, too, are experiencing loss and dislocation. Unnecessary border closures are denying many the chance to share Christmas with loved ones. Some, especially the elderly for whom online bookings remain problematic, will miss out on church services. Others miss attending carols by candlelight that suit our summer celebrations so well.
But the pandemic has also unleashed some better angels, with neighbours and relative strangers reaching out with surprise invitations, home-cooked meals, visits to nursing homes and extra support for the homeless and the poor. Coronavirus has changed how we live and work; it has also changed the way we prepare for and celebrate Christmas. It has removed some of the trimmings but the essential messages of salvation, generosity and hope are firmly intact. The changes are also a reminder that what many of us took for granted in past years was very special indeed. While 2020 has been heartbreaking for so many, it has been an “annus horribilis” for some Christian churches — and not only because of COVID-19. Amid China’s aggression, Christians in the East and West are uneasy about the Vatican’s pact with the Chinese government. The only possible justification, protecting the faithful in China, has not materialised. On Wednesday, Dennis Shanahan reported that $2.3bn was transferred by Vatican agencies to as yet unknown parties in Australia in more than 40,000 transactions from 2014 to this year. The revelation is indicative of the depth of corruption that has afflicted the Church’s senior echelons. During the pandemic, as some people turned to their local churches for comfort and guidance, they received mixed responses. Some parishes, including traditional and newer communities, interpreted restrictions with compassion and common sense. They responded warmly to parishioners and strangers, and emerged stronger from the crisis. Others, in contrast, upheld the letter of the law to the last drop of hand sanitiser but were grudging in providing the spiritual care people longed for. But regardless of restrictions, many people are ready for a quiet, peaceful celebration, free of last year’s bushfire menace and enhanced by soaking La Nina rainfall. The Australian wishes readers a happy, safe Christmas.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Biden must be firm with Iran	The Australian	The ayatollahs want sanctions eased in return for talking to the US US President Joe Biden’s firing of the starter’s gun for resumed talks with Iran about resurrecting Barack Obama’s deeply flawed 2015 nuclear deal was badly timed. It followed last week’s stepped-up rocket attacks by powerful Iranian-linked militia groups on residual US forces in neighbouring Iraq. The attacks are part of Tehran’s relentless drive to achieve Shia regional domination and force a total US retreat from Iraq.
Mr Biden’s announcement also coincided with the sentencing by a court in Belgium of a senior Iranian diplomat to 20 years’ imprisonment for a 2018 terrorist plot intended to blow up a rally of thousands of exiled Iranians outside Paris. They were rallying in opposition to the ayatollahs’ regime and in favour of democracy. Claims by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif that the bomb plot had been a “false flag” conceived to embarrass the ayatollahs were dismissed with contempt when evidence by Belgium’s VSSE security service showed the potentially devastating attack was “conceived in the name of Iran and under its leadership” as part of the rogue regime’s ongoing, global state-terrorism activities. The Biden administration’s announcement that it is keen to resume talks with Iran also coincided with confirmation by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran has again threatened to drastically limit the work of international inspectors monitoring its nuclear activities. That follows new evidence that it has further breached the enrichment limits of the 2015 deal and is moving to make uranium metal, which has no civilian use but could be part of a nuclear weapon.
In his rush to repudiate Donald Trump’s 2018 withdrawal of the US from the 2015 nuclear deal, Mr Biden must not ignore the incontrovertible evidence of unrelenting bad behaviour by the Tehran regime. Rewarding the ayatollahs for their continuing villainy would be absurd.
Mr Biden’s election win gave him a mandate to seek the US’s return to the deal. But giving in to Iran’s demands for the lifting of “maximum pressure” Trump-era sanctions as a precondition for resuming talks, reported in our World pages on Monday, would be a serious mistake. In rescinding Mr Trump’s tough line, the Biden administration, unfortunately, has already acknowledged that Tehran has the right to purchase advanced weapons. That is a potentially far-reaching concession and a strange way to deal with a rogue nation that persists in behaving so egregiously in support of terrorism. So is Mr Biden’s lifting of Mr Trump’s targeted domestic travel restrictions on Iranian diplomats accredited to the UN in New York.
With its many flaws and sunset provisions that effectively kept the door open wide to Iran’s dangerous nuclear ambitions, the 2015 deal is testimony to the way Tehran ran circles around Mr Obama’s negotiators. Some, including Mr Biden’s new Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, were among them. Iran’s hegemonic regional ambitions and brazen, ongoing involvement in state-sponsored terrorism in the Middle East and beyond show why Washington must remain implacable in ensuring that the extremist Islamic theocracy never acquires nuclear weapons and is never in a position to threaten Western allies, especially Israel. Mr Biden has said Washington will return to the Obama deal and lift sanctions if Tehran returns to full compliance with the 2015 accord. The US then wants to negotiate a follow-on agreement that would rewrite the Obama deal in a way that outlaws Tehran’s terrorist activities, its regional bullying and its ballistic missile-building program, which poses a threat to the entire region. Mr Biden is right to want to make up for the many shortcomings of the original Obama deal. But he will only succeed and ensure the security of key Western allies if he recognises the odious regime in Tehran is a serious danger to peace and security. Its extortionist demands for easing sanctions in return for talking must be rejected.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
States must focus on economies	The Australian	The benefits of lockdowns are being outweighed by the cost
Conscious as they are of shoring up their political legacies for “saving” their people from COVID-19, state and territory leaders, at this stage of the pandemic, should take a longer view. They need the courage and vision to put the economic future of their constituents first, especially the young, and look to the next generation. So far, only NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and her Treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, are putting their state’s economic recovery ahead of the temptation to overreact to ongoing outbreaks of the virus. A NSW cabinet subcommittee agreed on Sunday night that the economy is now the priority. There is recognition among senior Berejiklian government ministers that the newly fortified hospital system will need to be tested. Some members of the public inevitably will become ill. Some, sadly, will die. That recognition is not hard-hearted. Those who are most vulnerable, the elderly and sick, need to be well protected. Coronavirus is insidious and highly contagious. But Australia’s hospitals are well prepared and well equipped to cope with it.
A sensible unity has emerged within the NSW government that a Daniel Andrews-style lockdown needs to be avoided, as Yoni Bashan reports. Many business leaders, owners and workers concur. NSW needs to avoid going backwards. So do all states and territories. Allowing their economies to collapse like deck chairs would bring prolonged hardship and poverty. Those who believe the Andrews government’s flawed strategy needs to be recalibrated so only the most at-risk tower blocks or postcodes are targeted with precision quarantining are on the right track.
The nerve and resolve of the Berejiklian government will be tested if the Crossroads Hotel cluster in Sydney’s southwest spreads and fresh hotspots emerge. Fresh outbreaks are inevitable, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee has warned. Now that the initial phase of coronavirus has passed, these must be met with laser-like responses. The focus, as experience in Victoria shows, should be on faster and better testing and tracing, and effective quarantine. The link between two COVID-19 cases in people who attended Melbourne’s Black Lives Matter protest on June 6 and at least 242 cases in public housing towers in the city’s inner northwest, reported by Rachel Baxendale, underlines why tracing and testing are vital. In some situations face masks also help, medical experts advise. Around the nation, creeping complacency about hand washing, personal distancing and other precautions must be reversed.
Victorian Premier Andrews, whose state is already facing economic mayhem with its six-week shutdown of greater Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire, sent the wrong message on Monday when he refused to rule out stage four restrictions. Forcing another crippling burden on business and households in our second-largest state would have dire consequences in terms of poverty and social unrest. And Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, less than a week after opening up her state to all but Victorians, is already putting up the shutters, banning visitors from a vast swath of Sydney’s west — the local government areas of Liverpool or Campbelltown — or anyone who has been there recently. Premiers need to recognise that no state — even Tasmania — is an economic island. Artificial barriers weaken the whole. As the risks of an unmitigated pandemic in Australia have lessened, the costs of economic shutdown will increasingly outweigh the benefits of illnesses and deaths avoided. That is the key message in the analysis by Henry Ergas and Joe Branigan for the Menzies Research Centre. As the economists note, preventing an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19 will potentially cost $100bn this year, or 5 per cent of gross domestic product. Employment decreased by 600,000 in April and 228,000 in May as businesses shut. The true unemployment rate is about 13.1 per cent. Every national cabinet decision, the report argues, must now be “an incremental weighing up of the costs and benefits” of removing or reinstating restrictions. The folly of a stop-start approach to recovery is clear. Businesses need certainty if they are to plan, invest and create jobs and wealth. Providing that certainty must be the priority of state and territory leaders.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Morrison energy plan’s focus is ‘stuff that works’	The Australian	The blueprint has carrot and stick for renewables and gas Charged by the urgency of the COVID-19 crisis and the recession it has caused, Scott Morrison has laid out a much-needed blueprint to safeguard the future of Australia’s energy market. It is a mixture of carrot and stick that will enrage renewable energy purists and force gas exporters to the table to guarantee supplies and lower prices for domestic energy consumers. The electricity industry has been given a short horizon to deliver on promises to invest in firm electricity generation to replace what is lost when the Liddell coal-fired power station closes in NSW’s Hunter Valley. If it doesn’t, the government will step in as an investor of last resort with a 1000-megawatt gas-fired plant to underpin intermittent supplies from renewables.
The government will commit to new investment in infrastructure to move electricity and gas around an increasingly renewables-dependent national energy market. For electricity this means accelerating all priority interconnectors including the Marinus Link between Tasmania and the mainland, and other projects that strengthen links between South Australia, Victoria, NSW and Queensland For gas, the government will establish a gas hub at Wallumbilla in Queensland to deliver open competition in gas trading modelled on the Henry Hub system in the US. The reforms are designed to boost competition, challenge rent-seeking behaviour, promote jobs and empower consumers. In return, the federal government wants territory and state governments and industry to clear the way for more gas development. Oil refineries will be offered government support to bolster supply security at a time of rising geopolitical uncertainty.
The Morrison plan is portrayed as backward-looking by groups vested in a single-focus agenda of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. But the Prime Minister says the plan will allow Australia to meet its international commitments while safeguarding living standards and jobs. His pitch to voters is pragmatic, wanting to do the right thing to safeguard lower prices and jobs with a minimum risk of unexpected shocks. “We don’t believe we’ve put Australia in a position where we have to choose between meeting standards and sensible targets and surrendering people’s job,” Mr Morrison says.
The political wedge for Labor is clear given the experience of the federal election last year, when the opposition, under then leader Bill Shorten, was unable to cost its promise of bigger ambition on climate change action.
There is an element of government attempting to pick winners in the plan, which prioritises gas and uses public investment to force results. It is also at odds with the govenment’s pledge to be technology neutral.
In reality, however, the energy market already has been badly distorted by past policies such as the Renewable Energy Target that forced renewables into the market. More than $30bn was invested in renewables in Australia between 2017 and the middle of this year, and a further 12.6 gigawatts of renewable capacity will have been added last year and this year.
Mr Morrison says the government supports the rollout of cheaper renewables that help Australia meet its emissions reduction targets and hold the promise of further declines in energy costs for consumers. But he says this can be true only if the foundations of grid stability are in place with firming capacity to back up intermittent wind and solar. “I’m interested in stuff that works,” Mr Morrison says.
On the government’s reckoning, every megawatt of dispatchable generation from coal, gas, pumped hydro and batteries can firm around 2MW of renewables. The calculations are that without firm supplies to replace what is lost with the closure of the Liddell plant, wholesale prices could rise by 30 per cent.
Mr Morrison has given industry until April to commit to investment in 1000MW of firm generation or the government will act. Energy market reform is a core issue for the government and has been worked through by Energy Minister Angus Taylor. The latest blueprint seeks to deliver on the government’s consistent message of energy security, lower prices for consumers and better outcomes on emissions. The pandemic has enhanced the government’s sense of urgency and will sharpen the political contest given mixed signals on energy and emissions still being sent by the ALP.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
How to derange democracy 101	The Australian	The book Cynical Theories is a vital corrective to bad ideas Human Reactions to Rape Culture and Queer Performativity at Urban Dog Parks is not a title likely to impress anyone with real-world worries and responsibilities. Yet this hoax paper was accepted by a peer-reviewed journal because it’s not noticeably more absurd than much of the “social justice” research taken seriously in higher education. Now, two of the scholars involved in that instructive hoax have published a sober analysis of the various studies in race and gender that make claim to being “critical” but in fact are uncritical activism. This new book, Cynical Theories, by Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay, has featured in our pages with an extract, commentary by Paul Kelly and an author interview by Rosemary Neill.
Concern about profound intellectual corruption in the social sciences and humanities has been dismissed by progressives for years as a culture war with little purchase on reality. But many thoughtful commentators are turning to Cynical Theories as a timely explanation of the bad ideas responsible for some of the polarisation and conflict deranging the supposedly advanced democracies, most graphically in US cities such as Portland, Oregon, and institutions including The New York Times. Critical race theory is a large part of the reason decent people and good intentions have been too easily sidelined as Black Lives Matter protests morph into violence and anarchy.
Critical theory emerged from the postwar failure of the left’s economic program as it reinvented itself in the battlegrounds of culture and identity. Power and group membership are realities, of course, but the new progressive dogma reduces human society to a crude, unending struggle for dominance between designated oppressor categories (white blokes, take a bow) and victims who monopolise a new currency of virtue. The chaotic dynamism of interpersonal relations is dumbed down into tribal identities. Fact, truth and knowledge are not allowed any overarching validity but are seen as yet another contest for power dictated by hierarchies of oppression. Taken to an extreme, this paralyses debate because there is no common language of fact for varying opinions to interpret. This stance frustrates the political compromise that lies at the heart of a healthy democracy. The task of mutual understanding and building bridges between parties in dispute becomes fraught. Conflict sharpens and, in the worst case, intimidation and force rule the day. A society such as this cannot solve its problems, and spirals downward.
In Australia we are a long way from that dystopia, and America’s racial divide poses problems of a different order, but the very rapid decline in law, order and civility witnessed this year in the great republic of the US is a warning we cannot ignore. Critical race theory is especially counter-productive for any multicultural nation. As Pluckrose and Lindsay write: “We are told (by activist scholars) that racism is embedded in culture and that we cannot escape it. We hear that white people are inherently racist.” Racism exists and whites are not free of it, but the task of social harmony requires us to bring together people of goodwill, whatever their skin colour or politics, and to find common ground for respect and co-operation. Critical race theory does the opposite: it deepens the divide and offers toxic slogans instead of practical changes and new opportunities. “Social justice” sounds unambiguously good and that is why its banner has been uncritically passed from the universities to government agencies, cultural institutions, sections of the media and major corporations. But social justice activism of the critical theory kind is misleading: it masquerades as a solution to problems that in truth it can only worsen. It comes packaged in misleading language and attractive catchphrases; its incoherent assumptions and dogmas are hidden. This is why Cynical Theories is important: it is the idiot’s guide to woke ideology. Kelly says the book “should be read by every institutional leader and executive so they understand the ideological goals that lie beneath the policies they are implementing”. He is dead right.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Water reforms a win for farmers and improved use	The Australian	The breaking of the drought is a chance to kickstart change With the drought broken and weather agencies predicting La Nina conditions, which signal above average rainfall this summer, it is a good time to take stock of reform of the Murray-Darling Basin. Twelve years and more than $6bn into the rescue mission first launched by John Howard to balance the needs of farmers, rural communities and the environment, the challenge remains as fraught as ever. Which is why federal Water Minister Keith Pitt was guaranteed to receive a mixed reaction to his latest plan to stop water buybacks, prioritise farm communities and strengthen policing of the nation’s most important river system.
Managing the Murray-Darling Basin, which crosses state borders, has always been a tough political ask. For rural politicians, handing out licences to extract water has been akin to giving out rights to grow money, and votes. Sophisticated water trading markets have helped inject competition and efficiency into water use. But it has led to winners and losers in rural towns, where there will always be demand for more water. There also have been divisions between upstream and downstream states, and a growing pushback from environmental groups that argue climate change is exaggerating the boom-bust cycle that is part of the Australian experience.
Under the measures announced by Mr Pitt, rural communities appear to have the most to celebrate. The federal government has committed to not buy any more water from farmers but to focus on investing in technology to improve water use efficiency. There will be a $38m shake-up of policing water rules and the establishment of an inspector-general of water compliance office. The new body follows complaints of rorting, illegal harvesting and noncompliance, and will combine resources from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the Interim Inspector-General of Murray-Darling Basin office led by former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Keelty. The new approach delivers on recommendations last year from the Productivity Commission, which said the MDBA had conflicting roles and should be divided.
Irrigators have welcomed the end to buybacks and the focus on more efficient water use. To date, about two-thirds of water recovered for the environment under the basin plan has been purchased from irrigators, mostly between 2007 and 2014. A cap was introduced in 2015 and the most recent figures show that of total water savings from the plan, 1230 gigalitres have come from buybacks, 700GL from infrastructure projects and 255GL from on-farm upgrades. The long-running drought has amplified concerns in a study of socio-economic impacts of the basin plan that documented a growing sense of hopelessness within communities across the Murray-Darling Basin. The MDBA welcomed the new measures announced by the government, which it says represent a boost for communities. It has recommended investment in three key areas — supporting communities, building trust and transparency, and improving the implementation of the plan.
Not everyone is happy. A report by the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists says despite spending more than $6.7bn on water recovery under the basin plan so far, no official reports exist that measure whether the water recovered has resulted in increased river flows. As a result, it is impossible to say whether water reform has been successful. The group’s own monitoring has found 20 per cent of water expected each year under the basin plan did not flow past the measuring sites. This could be due to higher-than-expected evaporation, a miscalculation of environmental flows or upstream interception by farmers. Lack of data is a concern. The Wentworth Group argues that basin communities at the frontline of adjusting to water reform and taxpayers need to be confident the public investment in water recovery has increased river flows as predicted. The MDBA says the Wentworth Group report does not tell the whole story because of the drought. The authority is adamant that in the past seven years, the plan has increased flows and is making a difference to the environment. It says other measures including bird and fish breeding, vegetation health and the health of complex ecosystems such as the Gwydir wetlands and the Lower Lakes show the environment is responding to managed environmental water flows. The breaking of the drought is a good opportunity for a refresh. Shortfalls in monitoring must be addressed, and a clampdown on illegal operations is overdue. Given economic constraints imposed by COVID-19, prioritising resilience among rural communities and in food production is vital and the right approach.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Power of science is set to conquer Covid pandemic	The Australian	The breakthrough could make 2021 a far better year Dare we hope the COVID-19 pandemic is almost beaten? Thanks to science, the answer is yes. The announcement that global medical experts predict normal life may return by Easter is a tonic for the entire world. The announcement by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer that its vaccine trial has wildly exceeded expectations has raised the prospect that five million Australians — starting with health and aged-care workers, the elderly and the vulnerable — will receive the requisite two doses of the coronavirus vaccine early next year. Last week the Morrison government announced it had struck a deal with Pfizer for 10 million doses of its vaccine. Pfizer, founded in 1849 by German-American Charles Pfizer and his cousin Charles Erhart in Brooklyn, New York, has developed its vaccine with German partner BioNTech. On Monday afternoon US time it released interim data from its phase three trial confirming the vaccine was 90 per cent effective. It was, as Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla said, “a great day for science and a great day for humanity”. And for the spirits of billions of people and for the world’s economic prospects.
Scientists caution that the data has not yet been peer-reviewed, As Natasha Robinson reports on Wednesday, Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration has wasted no time in clearing the way for Pfizer to apply for fast-tracked approval via emergency regulations. These allow for the provisional registration of urgently required vaccines. The TGA is examining safety data and working with overseas regulators to slash the time it will take to approve the vaccine for use. Such a breakthrough is desperately needed.
In the past week 3.5 million new cases of the virus have been diagnosed, taking known cases across the world past 51 million, Health Minister Greg Hunt told question time on Tuesday. Another 50,000 people have died from the virus in the past week, taking the death toll to 1.26 million. Australia, heading into summer and shielded by our island status and international border controls, was in the fortunate position on Tuesday of recording our third COVID-free day in a row, with nobody in intensive care with the virus. That situation has been achieved, however, only after nine months of intense and often heartbreaking sacrifices and effort by communities and businesses under the leadership of governments forced to make hard decisions. Nothing is certain in dealing with a deadly, highly contagious and unpredictable enemy. But if the vaccine matches its promise, Australia’s death toll hopefully will be contained at the current figure of 907 — 819 of which occurred in Victoria. Australia, to date, has recorded 27,668 COVID cases.
Australians will not be the first in the world to be immunised, as Tom Dusevic writes, because the government was slow to back a horse in the vaccine stakes. Keeping our options open could mean taxpayers will pay a premium, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars more, to get “free” access to a suite of vaccines. The Pfizer vaccine is one of four Australia is involved in. The government also has supply agreements for three other vaccines, developed by Oxford University-Astra­Zeneca, the University of Queensland-CSL and Novavax, which are due in the next year pending clinical success and approvals. As Oxford University regius professor of medicine Sir John Bell says: “I can’t see any reason now why we shouldn’t have a handful of good vaccines.’’ Nor, as Australia’s retiring Chief Scientist, Alan Finkel, told the government earlier in the year, is it a given that vaccines licensed first will be the most effective. As Dr Finkel said, in the rush to develop a vaccine, international regulatory and safety protocols must not be weakened. Until the virus is conquered, Australia will continue on the narrow, challenging path of opening up the economy, encouraging recovery while also guarding against infection through social distancing, tracking and good hygiene. The Morrison government’s decision to extend JobSeeker coronavirus payments at a reduced rate until the end of March, assisting more than 1.5 million unemployed people, is a sensible interim step. The advent of a safe, effective vaccine, however, will be the most important step in the return to normal. Christmas is shaping as “COVID normal”. Easter promises more, but a full return to normal will not happen overnight. When it does, we will value it like never before.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Plan widens ABC’s perspective	The Australian	The broadcaster will be judged on the quality of its content Like most media organisations, the ABC is making changes to live within its budget. Taxpayers provide the public broadcaster with a generous $1bn in funding a year. How it is spent is up to the corporation’s executives and producers. What the public expects, as chairwoman Ita Buttrose wrote in the ABC’s annual report last year, is “an independent, accessible public broadcasting service that produces quality drama, comedy and specialist content, entertaining and educational children’s programming, stories of local lives and issues, and news and current affairs coverage that holds power to account and contributes to a healthy democratic process”.
Organisational change is usually difficult. But managing director David Anderson’s 50-page, five-year strategic plan is designed to shift the ABC’s compass in a way that will address some of its problems. Sydney is not Australia and Ultimo, the inner-city suburb where the ABC is headquartered, is not Sydney, as Communications Minister Paul Fletcher says. The initiative to make the corporation less Sydney-centric by basing 75 per cent of its journalists, producers and editors outside Ultimo by 2025, compared with 64 per cent now, is worthwhile. Replacing people who leave Ultimo in the next few years with staff at locations such as Parramatta, interstate capital cities or regional areas will broaden the perspectives of programmers, news coverage and commentary. Over time, regional news and current affairs programs scrapped in recent years should be restored.
The decision to scrap the ABC Life division makes sense. In allocating resources, the move accords with the corporation’s charter to consider services already provided by commercial and community broadcasters. The focus of ABC Life — food, wellbeing, work, money, travel, style, sex and relationships, home and garden, and family — saturates an already crowded market catered to by commercial entities in digital, broadcast and print media. Redirecting resources from ABC Life should allow content makers to venture into high-quality programming not provided elsewhere.
Beyond examining the broad direction of the plan and whether it serves taxpayers’ interests, decisions about which 250 staff are to be made redundant and which programs will be cut or scaled back are matters for Mr Anderson and his management team, including editors. Because the ABC is taxpayer-funded, the public interest and balance should be at the centre of such decisions. As Scott Morrison says, the ABC remains the safest place for journalists to work because its revenue is guaranteed by government.
The release of Mr Anderson’s plan coincides with publication of the efficiency review into the ABC and SBS conducted by former Foxtel boss Peter Tonagh and former media regulator Richard Bean. At least one of the recommendations in that review — closer co-operation between the two public broadcasters to share support, back office, property services and broadcast facilities — would be worth both broadcasters exploring. Amid the digital revolution, Mr Anderson is correct when he says ABC audiences want “to watch, read and listen to the ABC when and where it suits them’’. In making the plan work, the broadcaster must get on with the job of improving the quality and balance of what it offers audiences. It will be judged on that content.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
More flexible workplaces, without the warrior idols	The Australian	The budget must focus on jobs and be driven by fresh ideas Josh Frydenberg claims his heroes Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan “are figures of hate for the left because they were so successful”. In the 1980s the two warrior idols cut regulation and taxes to improve the supply side in Britain and the US. Here, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating reduced the hand of government in the economy, creating wealth and jobs. Opposition Treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers claims the Treasurer’s references to Thatcher and Reagan “would send a shudder down the spine of many Australian workers”. Really? For Dr Chalmers, who knows his Labor history before the dismal statist rule of Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan and two-time loser Bill Shorten, this is an intellectual cul-de-sac and a worrying sign about alternative policy approaches. ACTU secretary Sally McManus chimed in with a sledge that the Iron Lady’s policies were about “crushing worker rights”. Spare us.
Let’s get a grip and return to first principles and priorities, such as jobs. The economy faces a depression if we can’t get a steady heartbeat and sales blood into a broader range of industries. Although there was a pick-up in the labour market before Victoria imposed a six-week lockdown, the effective unemployment rate is 11.3 per cent. The youth jobless rate is 16.4 per cent. Even before the pandemic, graduates were struggling to find jobs in their desired occupation, a Productivity Commission study shows. After the global financial crisis, their lot was part-time work, lower starting wages and a limited choice in occupations despite the increase in credentials. COVID-19 will make things only harder for young workers. We need a training system that meets the needs of employers and is easy for young people to navigate.
Post-crisis, it can’t be business as usual in our workplace arrangements. Employers and unions have accepted the Morrison government’s truce; the JobKeeper package provides life support to employers and employees, and demands a mutual obligation in flexibility at work over rosters and job definition. Five themed government-enabled sit-downs over workplace reform may still yield some practical options. Yet no one is suggesting a workplace revolution, as Canberra’s toxic politics allow for only incremental changes. Even still, Scott Morrison has said he will take his preferred reform options to the parliament if official talks don’t yield practical improvements.
Right now, the overly regulated labour market prices out our least experienced workers. Australia has the world’s highest minimum wage rate when measured in purchasing-power-adjusted US dollars, according to the OECD’s latest global comparison. Let’s hold off on the medal ceremony. Sure, it means low-skilled workers are relatively better off here than in other countries. Yet it’s a de facto welfare policy imposing costs right across the economy. But the unemployed or those who would like to work more hours bear the cost for this paternalism. In June the Fair Work Commission raised the minimum wage by 1.75 per cent to $19.84 an hour or $753 a week, although the rise will be staggered over seven months; employers argued for a wage freeze, given the pandemic and above-inflation pay gains in recent years.
As we argued at the time, the commission had taken a needless risk during the nation’s worst economic downturn in 90 years. In a dissenting view, panel member Mark Wooden urged his peers to put jobs and extra hours ahead of any increase in hourly rates. Small businesses, where award-reliant workers are over-represented, will now find it more difficult to stay above water as they have reduced access to credit and a lesser ability to diversify risk. A freeze was justified. For those caught up in evanescent social media wins and delivering TV zingers, we remind them: the best way to sustained growth in incomes is through higher productivity. That can come only through more investment — in digital tools, machinery, health and skills — and economic dynamism. On Monday, the Prime Minister said he was pursuing a “uniquely Australian response” to fix the economy’s supply-side problems. Workplace reform has to be at the centre of a game plan to grow the economy at 3.75 per cent a year for the next five years. Regulating young people out of work is soul-destroying for them and self-defeating for a nation on track for $1 trillion in debt and at risk of stagnation, as are others. The October budget needs big, fresh ideas for a jobs-centric growth agenda.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Star chambers corrupt politics	The Australian	The case for a federal anti-corruption body is paper thin The poor judgment of NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian — or rather its public exposure — has predictably led to demands for a federal anti-corruption body, and without delay. But what we’re watching unfold before the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption only strengthens the case for caution and realism. It’s facile to dismiss sceptics of standing anti-corruption bodies as people with something to hide. Serious corruption has to be tackled, obviously, but the very uneven results of ICAC and its other state counterparts should by now have dashed naive expectations of these institutions.
The NSW body has indeed exposed cases of serious corruption, but it has also exceeded its powers, left innocent people with shattered reputations and shown its own poor judgment by its misuse of publicity. In a letter to the editor on Monday, former Federal Court judge Peter R. Graham pointed out that anti-corruption commissions and other such inquisitorial bodies “are star chambers, where safeguards that common law procedures provide for the protection of the liberty of subjects are lacking”. Sometimes, these extraordinary powers are necessary, but there are always serious risks.
In theory, there is bipartisan support for a federal anti-corruption agency. In reality, any political party in government and weathering a scandal such as sports rorts would have found it easier to go along with a motherhood accountability project. Had the Coalition adopted an implacable stance of “anti-anti-corruption agency”, it would have been endlessly assailed as “pro-corruption” by Labor.
But all this was pre-COVID. Maybe with a pandemic crisis, collapsing public finances and a grim strategic outlook, the government will take a tougher, more principled line. Earlier this month, federal Attorney-General Christian Porter dryly remarked there were “more immediate priorities” than rushing out draft legislation for the promised commonwealth integrity commission. Those on the legal left will wail and gnash their teeth. Rumour has it they were already worried because the Coalition had put on the record its wish to avoid the pitfalls and excesses of anti-corruption bodies in the states.
It’s noteworthy that Labor and the Greens are the greatest enthusiasts for the anti-corruption bandwagon. One vice of the standing star chamber is that it usurps normal political conflict if an aggrieved party finds something that can be worked up to look “corrupt”. This weakens democracy, just as confected anti-discrimination complaints, lawfare and constitutional pointscoring take matters out of the hands of elected representatives and entrust them to a legal elite. A more prosaic objection to a federal anti-corruption body is that boredom might leave it with little to do apart from fighting turf wars with the myriad, well-funded federal agencies fighting everything from espionage through organised crime to tea room larceny in the public service. The commonwealth domain is heavy with dull-as-a-dog policy, unlike state and local governments with their juicy project contracts and land deals (the Badgerys Creek federal land purchase may be the exception that proves the rule). Before adding yet another supra-political agency, why not lift the standard of scrutiny by federal parliamentary committees? And if the legal left really cares about independent media scrutiny, it could give up its illiberal pretence that reporting and commentary it disagrees with ought to be a punishable offence.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
US Democrats need to move on	The Australian	The chances of enough Republicans in the US Senate turning on Donald Trump to give Democrats the numbers to convict him over his second impeachment were always slim. That is now even less likely after Tuesday, when 45 of 50 Republican senators voted that his trial, due on February 9, was unconstitutional on the grounds that Mr Trump was now a private citizen.
There is no certainty they are correct. US constitutional scholars are divided over whether an impeachment trial can be held after a president leaves office, even though Mr Trump’s actions over the January 6 attack on the Capitol building, as The Wall Street Journal has concluded, “were an impeachable offence”. But there is little prospect of the 50 senators in the Democratic caucus getting the 17 Republican votes needed for a two-thirds majority conviction. Joe Biden has been no more than a lukewarm supporter of the process, initiated by house Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer. After impeachment in the house, there is no certainty that the Senate trial that must follow can be short-circuited or terminated. But Mr Biden, in his own interests, should try to ensure that happens. The Democrats’ aim is to punish Mr Trump and bar him from seeking public office. But just as Mr Biden needs clear air, Mr Trump’s acquittal will distract attention and give the former president a lever to claim he is, yet again, the victim of a sham. Mr Trump would use it to boost his prospects for a return, claiming it showed the elite’s contempt for the 74 million people who voted for him in November, many of whom believe he was cheated of victory. Mr Trump’s presidency deserved to end in infamy after the attack on the Capitol. But Democrats are not helping Mr Biden pursue reconciliation and unity. By persisting in seeking revenge against Mr Trump they could help enable his revival.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Parties start parliamentary year locked in a dead heat	The Australian	The close contest will allow Labor to hold the government to account For good reason, Scott Morrison has chosen to quote Chris Richardson from Deloitte Access Economics in his National Press Club speech on Monday: “You’d rather be here than almost anywhere else.’’ Perth’s five-day lockdown after a quarantine hotel security guard tested positive to COVID-19 is a reminder that the virus will remain a major issue for all governments this year. Rolling out the nation’s vaccination program will present fresh challenges. With more than 90 per cent of jobs lost during the pandemic restored, and households and small businesses repaying more than 80 per cent of the loans deferred at the height of the pandemic, the Prime Minister returns to parliament on Tuesday with the wind at his back. Across the despatch box, Anthony Albanese will be battling to assert authority in opposition ranks. But with a possible election this year, or early next year at the latest, the race for supremacy between the major parties is closer than many recognise.
Newspoll on Monday shows that despite the Coalition’s 42-36 per cent lead on the primary vote, Labor is competitive, as the main beneficiary of Greens preferences. The vital two-party-preferred vote is 50-50. Mr Albanese’s potential rivals will note he trails Mr Morrison 29-57 as preferred prime minister, a margin that will prompt some of them, and opposition backbenchers in marginal seats, to wonder what difference a change of leader might make. Much will depend on Mr Albanese’s performance in the five sitting weeks between now and the end of March. The revelation of Labor’s new industrial relations policy in the next fortnight will test its economic credentials. Lifting productivity to enable stronger growth and encourage businesses to hire new staff warrants workplace relations reforms, from both major parties.
One of the government’s big challenges will be maintaining living standards after JobKeeper ceases at the end of next month. The program had helped 3.5 million Australians through the pandemic, at a cost of $80bn. While the resumption of international travel is not yet on the horizon, it is vital for the economic recovery that state borders remain open. As Josh Frydenberg told the ABC on Sunday, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce told him that the hard border closure with NSW imposed by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk after Christmas resulted in Qantas and Jetstar cancelling 1500 flights and 200,000 passenger bookings. While Treasury is considering new, post-March support packages for struggling industries, these must be “proportionate, timely, scalable and targeted”, as Mr Morrison has promised. As he says: “You can’t run the Australian economy on taxpayers’ money forever.’’ With federal and state government debts on track to more than double to $1.75 trillion in the five years to 2024, Mr Morrison, sensibly, is planning to focus on “the fiscal discipline necessary to ensure that we do not overburden future generations and continue to spend taxpayers’ money wisely’’. Retiring debt while interest rates are low will help restore public finances and ensure the nation is better positioned to respond to future economic crises. That chance must not be wasted. Policies to respond to climate change while minimising hardship and managing Australia’s fraught trading relationship with China will also be key topics for policy-makers and debate. With the major parties level pegging, Mr Albanese’s leadership under pressure and issues at the heart of the national interest at stake, question time should be compelling.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime

ASEAN missing on Myanmar	The Australian	The coup and the prospect of civil war threaten regional stability Much was expected of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations after Myanmar’s generals staged their coup on February 1 and launched the reign of terror that has appalled the world. Since then at least 581 unarmed civilians, including 46 children, have been killed by the army, many by sniper fire. Hundreds more have been wounded in ongoing protests against the military junta. Almost 3000 people — including Myanmar’s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who won last November’s election in a landslide, and her Australian economics adviser, Sean Turnell — are in detention, their fate uncertain.
The beginnings of an armed resistance to the junta are emerging, Southeast Asia correspondent Amanda Hodge reported on Wednesday. The stirrings are the start of what many believe could be a civil war with potentially dire security and humanitarian consequences for the region, especially Myanmar’s ASEAN neighbours. Yet the region’s pre-eminent multilateral institution and the body best placed to help mediate a solution to the crisis and return Myanmar to the path of democratic gradualism remains paralysed. ASEAN’s 10 member-nations — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar itself — are conflicted about what, if anything, should be done.
Even the announcement of plans for a long-awaited emergency summit of ASEAN leaders “to discuss the ongoing developments in Myanmar” was surrounded by uncertainty on Wednesday. No precise date for the gathering was given and no details about it were announced, other than the fact it would be held in Jakarta. Such vagueness reflects poorly on ASEAN and the pivotal role that the UN and most nations concerned about the Myanmar bloodbath expect it to play in working towards a solution that will help end the killing. As Hodge wrote, ASEAN’s credibility “is on the line over its lethargic response to the coup and subsequent violence, which many fear could spiral into a nationwide civil war and regional humanitarian catastrophe”. In its own interests, and those of regional stability, ASEAN must do better.
The reluctance of some member-states — notably Thailand, with its long and porous border with Myanmar, as well as Vietnam and Cambodia — to criticise the coup or the killings is delusional and shortsighted. Leaders of those nations insist that what is occurring in Myanmar is “an internal matter”. ASEAN has a founding principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of member-states. But as the killings in Myanmar have continued and the crisis has escalated to the point where it poses a threat to the region’s stability, it is hard to see that principle as anything but support for the junta and its onslaught.
With the US, the EU, Britain and Canada in the lead, some countries and global corporations have imposed sanctions targeted at coup leader General Min Aung Hlaing and his cronies. But supine ASEAN members have done little to follow that lead. Singapore, Myanmar’s biggest foreign investor, has strong links to the military’s business conglomerates, which sustain the generals. But it has declined to take action beyond expressing “grave concern” about the coup and describing the use of lethal force against protesters as “inexcusable”. Myanmar relies heavily on Singapore’s financial institutions. Thailand, on which Myanmar has been heavily dependent for decades, also has shied away from criticising the coup, despite fears that a flood of refugees fleeing the junta’s violence could cross its long border with Myanmar. Former Singaporean foreign minister Bilahari Kausikan has said there is a need for realism about what ASEAN can and cannot do. But that is no excuse for its failure to try to end the bloodshed. ASEAN leaders, including Thailand’s ruling generals, have longstanding relationships with Myanmar’s leaders, especially General Min Aung Hlaing. That should provide useful access.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Andrews’s love ban fiasco was one diktat too many	The Australian	The current era of state control is at odds with how we live
Common sense prevailed at the 11th hour in Victoria on Wednesday after the Andrews government saw fit to poke its nose into citizens’ private lives. “You cannot visit your partner for social reasons,” Police Minister Lisa Neville tweeted early in the day. Premier Daniel Andrews initially supported the diktat, which smacked of Hogwarts High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge promising to punish Harry Potter and his fellow students if they defied her decrees, such as: “Boys and girls are not permitted to be within 6 inches of each other.” Shortly before 5pm, Mr Andrews seemed to discover his sense of romance, or a grain of common sense. The state’s Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, brought the fiasco to a close , tweeting that Victoria had no desire to penalise couples who did not live together. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s advice earlier in the week — “Now’s not the time for fun” — clearly needs to be applied judiciously.
Politicians and police have difficult jobs in overseeing the quarantining and social distancing needed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, they need to maximise public co-operation and goodwill. Invoking the language of a police state does not help. Neither does the idea of being spied on in everyday life by drones. As Chris Kenny wrote on Wednesday: “It is no good assuaging the shrill voices of Twitter (not the real world) if you infantilise and antagonise mainstream Australians.” We are all in this together. The battle against coronavirus will be won, ultimately, by the community, supported with medical expertise and firm but careful political leadership. In a nation where freedom and a healthy scepticism about authority are part of our DNA, imposing over-the-top rules and regulations from on high rarely achieves optimum outcomes.
Some influential voices disagree. On Sky News on Tuesday, conservative political strategist Grahame Morris insisted Australians needed to be “saved from their own stupidity”. Only a small minority. Labor strategist Bruce Hawker welcomed footage showing five police cars driving off roadways in Rushcutters Bay Park in Sydney’s inner east earlier in the day and stopping close to sunbathers and others who had stopped to rest. The people were ordered to go home because they were stationary in the park and not exercising or outside for an essential purpose, such as food shopping. “People need to be directed,” Mr Hawker said. “The world, in Australia anyway, is a very, very different place to what it was a week ago and it has to keep like this.” For as limited a time as possible, we would urge. It would be profoundly disturbing if, after weeks and months of living under such rigid state control, citizens became even remotely comfortable with it or authorities became comfortable with dictating where people were allowed to go, what they were allowed to do, and when.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian did not answer on Wednesday morning when asked if she was running a police state. With fines of up to $11,000 and six months’ jail for anyone caught leaving their home without a valid excuse, it was a reasonable question. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller, to his credit, conceded his officers might have gone too far on Tuesday. “I’ve seen the vision (of Rushcutters Park) myself, I’ve thought a lot about it — on one hand, could they have got out of the car and achieved the same thing in a less aggressive way? Yes, they could. On the other hand, there’s (hundreds) of parks we’ve got to get to at the same time,” he said. “That was probably a bit disappointing and confronting.” Mr Fuller has asked police to exercise a high level of discretion. As he says, “the fact we haven’t issued a single ticket since this power was turned on I think is a pretty good example that we are measured in our response.”Guarding against the spread of coronavirus is paramount at present. But businesses, community, sporting and social groups, churches and the public should not feel intimidated about speaking up if and when they believe restrictions need modifying. Unlike free association and movement, our rights to free speech and rigorous debate have not been erased. But irresponsible demands for a premature relaxation of restrictions need to be avoided.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
The current owners of our cover star this week have left the [... ] [Derived headline ]	The New Zealand Herald	The current owners of our cover star this week have left their mark — literally — on this historic Remuera mansion that dates from 1914. Katherine Strevens, an accomplished artist, spent many hours carefully embellishing several of its walls and doors with pretty bird and floral designs, inspired by grand homes she’d visited in Europe. The couple carefully converted the property, used during the 1950s and 60s as the Teachers Kindergarten Training Centre, back into a home after they bought it in the 1980s.
At the other end of the spectrum is a stunning property in Omaha that is no ordinary beach house. According to the owners, the architecturally designed home makes a big impact, while being “subtly understated” at the same time. Take a look at its vertical black cedar screen and sleek and stylish interior on page 5.
And our OneRoof interview is with top agent Nadja Court, who knows what families need in their house hunting, again and again, selling $2.6 billion of property in her 21 years in the business. Her professionalism is so well respected in the industry that the majority of her clients are referrals or repeats. You can read about Nadja’s journey on page 87.
Have a happy and safe weekend.

Growing concern over China state infiltration	The Australian	The data drop of Communist Party members provides a wake-up call Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security chairman Andrew Hastie undoubtedly is right when he says not every member of the Chinese Communist Party should be viewed with concern. In an oppressive one-party state, many of the CCP’s 92 million members, as he points out, join “just to get ahead in life”. What matters, Mr Hastie adds, is when CCP members are found to be working on “projects that have national significance for Australia”. In that context, our report on Monday about the extent to which the CCP has infiltrated foreign consulates in Shanghai, as well as global corporations and banks, should be a timely wake-up call to governments everywhere about the need for stepped-up vigilance and security vetting.
Based on a world-first leak of official membership data exposing the personal details of 1.95 million CCP members, Sharri Markson, Jared Lynch and Remy Varga disclosed that a Chinese government-run recruitment agency, the Shanghai Foreign Agency Service Department, systematically has been placing CCP members in the Australian, British, US and at least seven other consulates in Shanghai for more than a decade. Few democratic nations appear to have been immune to taking on CCP employees through the SFASD. Some, the records show, have been employed for more than a decade in the US consulate and even longer at the Italian and South African consulates. They have been working as senior political and government affairs specialists, clerks, economic advisers and executive assistants.
A senior executive assistant who worked at Australia’s Shanghai consulate and was involved in visits of parliamentary delegations has been listed as a CCP member. In Britain’s Shanghai consulate, a CCP member works near MI6 intelligence officers operating under deep cover. The leaked database also shows a CCP member worked for the New Zealand consulate in Shanghai for four years as a policy adviser on trade and economics. Similarly infiltrated by CCP employees, as disclosed in the database leaked to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China made up of 150 legislators from around the world, have been global companies such as Boeing, which has billions of dollars in international defence contracts, including with Australia; banks, including ANZ and HSBC; the Pfizer and AstraZeneca pharmaceutical companies developing coronavirus vaccines; and Western universities.
At a time of heightened tensions over unrelenting Chinese belligerence towards much of the world, it is obviously important to maintain perspective about the leaked data. It would be wrong if the disclosures prompted an outbreak of McCarthyism in Australia or impinged in any way on the lives of the Chinese community that lives and works peacefully in our country. Liberal MP Dave Sharma, who is experienced in security matters after serving as our ambassador to Israel, said on Monday that the disclosures were worrying and “are an important reminder that in a political system such as China’s, the individual exists to serve the state … of course we’ve got to worry about people who have got Communist Party members working in big offices”. He added, however, that Australian diplomatic missions had measures in place to deal with all security risks, with highly compartmentalised streams of information for locally engaged and Australian staff. This view was echoed by a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson: “There is a clear distinction in the roles, responsibilities and work of Australians who are posted and locally engaged staff at our embassies and high commissions.” That is reassuring as far as it goes. But it does not diminish the need for intensified vetting and vigilance at our own and other diplomatic missions, as well as the offices of corporations and banks where CCP members are employees. It is no secret that the first loyalty of every CCP member is not to an employer, whoever that may be, but to the party. The oath sworn by new members reads: “It is my will to join the Communist Party of China, uphold the party’s program, observe the provisions of the party constitution, fulfil a party member’s duties, carry out the party’s decisions, strictly observe party discipline, guard party secrets, be loyal to the party, work hard, fight for communism throughout my life, be ready at all times to sacrifice my all for the party and the people, and never betray the party.” That leaves no doubt about the views of even those such as prominent academic Chen Hong, who has devoted his life to a study of Australia and its literature but had his Australian visa abruptly cancelled by ASIO in August. As an intelligence officer told our reporters, any CCP member allowed to work in a foreign country’s embassy — or any foreign company or bank — should be assumed to be a potential spy. With the SFASD, in the words of Samuel Armstrong of the British Henry Jackson Society think tank, “looking and smelling like a well-organised, state-sponsored spy ring”, that is sound advice. In recent times, the frenzied bullying of the CCP “wolf warriors” has been on full display, not only in their malevolence towards Australia and democratic countries across the world but also in their brutal suppression of Hong Kong and attacks on India in the Himalayas. The database underlines the need for diplomatic missions, global corporations, banks and others constantly to be mindful of the CCP members working in their midst.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Myanmar atrocities require action	The Australian	The deadliest day so far in the horrifying killing of Myanmar’s unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators underlines the need for urgent international action to compel the generals to end their appalling bloodbath. On Sunday alone, at least 74 demonstrators were killed. They included up to 40 who were shot when soldiers moved into the Hlaingthya industrial suburb of Yangon after protesters, angered by what they believed to be Beijing’s support for the military junta, burned down dozens of Chinese-owned factories and warehouses. Another 20 were killed on Monday, bringing the total of those shot dead by security forces since the February 1 coup to at least 202.
Well over 2000 people are in detention, many dragged from their beds in night raids, and some believed to have then been tortured and killed. Among those in detention are the country’s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was re-elected in a landslide in November, and her Australian economics adviser Professor Sean Turnell. As Amanda Hodge reported on Wednesday, among those killed by the army in the latest violence were a 15-year-old girl and a pregnant woman who sheltered fleeing demonstrators. A 50-year-old man who was clearing rubbish from Hlaingthya’s streets died when a soldier put a gun to his temple and shot him. Yangon residents have been dragged from their beds and made to kneel in the street while being beaten over the heads with batons, then dragged away to an unknown fate.
Such grotesque brutality is intolerable and demands action by all countries which care about human rights and decency. But the UN appears paralysed, largely because of nefarious interference run by China and Russia, as permanent members of the Security Council, in protecting the generals against any sort of effective action to bring an end to the violence. China has been playing a particularly devious role as the crisis has escalated. The belief is that Beijing, with an eye to Myanmar’s regional strategic importance, is doing all it can to secretly help the generals put down the protests, including supplying them with weapons. The US, Australia, the EU, Britain and Canada have, as usual, been in the forefront of condemning the violence and imposing sanctions on the junta. This has included an end by Australia to military co-operation with the regime. A more widespread, global effort is urgently needed to intensify the pressure needed to compel the generals to end the bloodshed. In the absence of UN action, it is imperative that countries across the world impose effective targeted sanctions on the regime’s corrupt leaders and the smuggling and money laundering that has for decades underpinned the army’s vast wealth.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Biden under pressure over Iran	The Australian	The death of scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh is a setback for Tehran
Friday’s assassination of top Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh has blown a significant hole in Tehran’s unrelenting ambition to acquire nuclear weapons. He was the program’s mastermind who drew together many strands of its research. He led the clandestine acquisition of vital components in defiance of global sanctions, the building of missiles and guidance systems, and the miniaturisation needed to install nuclear devices into warheads. As much as Dr Fakhrizadeh’s demise is a major setback for Iran, it also underlines the difficulties confronting US president-elect Joe Biden as he prepares to make good on his election pledges to abandon Donald Trump’s unrelentingly hardline stance on Iran and reopen negotiations about returning the US to Barack Obama’s 2015 nuclear deal.
Israel has remained silent about Iranian charges that the Mossad spy agency was behind Dr Fakhrizadeh’s killing. But on Friday night, Israeli reporters were briefed about what a setback it was for Iran’s nuclear plans. Unusually following such assassinations attributed to Israel, major Israeli television stations on Saturday described the killing as “the pinnacle of Israeli strategy to thwart Iran getting the bomb”. There were also reports that Mossad chief Yossi Cohen attended an unprecedented meeting in Saudi Arabia last week involving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and two other “anti-Iran hawks” — Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The meeting coincided with Donald Trump ordering B-52 Stratofortress bombers to the Gulf, while Israel’s military was put on high alert.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday appeared to rule out immediate retaliation. He vowed revenge “at the right time”, saying Iran was “too wise to fall into” Israel’s “trap”. In a reference to Iran’s hopes for re-engagement with the Biden administration, Mr Rouhani said: “The savage assassination shows our enemies are having anxious weeks … they feel the pressure is going to decrease … the world’s conditions are changing.” Mr Netanyahu, a close ally of President Trump in achieving recent significant diplomatic breakthroughs with moderate Sunni states, has made his abhorrence at the prospect of Mr Biden returning the US to the Obama nuclear deal crystal clear. Some US analysts have suggested Dr Fakhrizadeh’s assassination should be seen in the context of Mr Netanyahu and Mr Trump working to create circumstances that will lock in maximum pressure against any softening on Iran under a Biden White House. That remains to be seen. But what is not in doubt is that the situation shows what a tinderbox Iran remains and why Mr Biden should be in no rush to alleviate the concerted pressure Mr Trump has successfully built up against the oppressive Iranian regime by rushing to return to negotiations over the nuclear deal.
Ahead of Mr Biden’s arrival in the White House, Dr Fakhrizadeh’s assassination is a timely reminder that, from the start, Mr Obama’s flawed nuclear deal was built on Iranian deception and obfuscation. In May 2018 Mr Netanyahu revealed a secret Iranian nuclear archive containing chapter and verse on Tehran’s ongoing, but constantly denied, nuclear weapons building program. At its pinnacle was Dr Fakhrizadeh. “Remember that name,” Mr Netanyahu said as he detailed the scientist’s work building some of the world’s deadliest weapons for the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Sanctions imposed by Mr Trump have seriously weakened the rogue regime. Tehran now exports only a quarter of the 2.5 million barrels of oil a day it shipped previously, depriving it of $US50bn a year. Iran has increased its violations against the deal. It now has 12 times the enriched uranium allowed under the original accord. Germany, France and Britain, which still support the deal, met in Berlin last week urging Iran to uphold it. Up to the time of his death Dr Fakhrizadeh was working secretly at building Tehran’s nuclear weapons. That should convince Mr Biden of the need to keep the pressure on Tehran. Rushing into a new deal would risk blowing up the progress Mr Trump has achieved in getting moderate Sunni states to normalise relations with Israel. Mr Biden must insist that unless Tehran comes clean about its nuclear program there will be no talks.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Taciturn China shuns dialogue	The Australian	The death penalty is anathema to the values of our nation
Beijing’s absurd bluster falsely alleging Australian racism against Chinese students and tourists has been swiftly turned against the Chinese Communist Party. The gratuitous “advice” from a Chinese foreign ministry official, as reported on Saturday, was for Australia to “do some soul-searching”. But 300 human rights groups from just about every sector in Africa, and about 1800 activists, have issued a searing critique denouncing the “xenophobic, racist and inhuman treatment of Africans in China”, particularly during the COVID-19 crisis. Such detailed, intense condemnation leaves Beijing’s attacks on so-called Australian racism with little credibility. “They (the Chinese) treat us like dogs,” Joe, from the West African nation of Liberia, who lives and works in Guangzhou, home to an African diaspora of 14,000, told China correspondent Will Glasgow. Edgard Shingiro, from Burundi, spoke of Africans being “ostracised for months” over the virus that emerged from Wuhan. The letter demanding action over Chinese racism, compiled for the African Union, spoke of “horrendous dehumanisation of Africans in China”.
Scott Morrison, who rightly dismissed claims of racism against Chinese people in Australia as “rubbish”, pointed out on Friday that Australia has “done nothing to injure” the nation’s partnership with China. The reality, as Foreign Minister Marise Payne says, is that the CCP appears hellbent on a campaign of disinformation, despite the long-term relationship being mutually beneficial. China is also refusing to negotiate at ministerial level, which is how mature nations resolve their differences.
In this environment, suspicions are rife that the dismissive, one-sentence statement in Chinese state media about the death sentence handed down to Australian actor-turned-entrepreneur Karm Gilespie, 55, seven years after he was arrested on drug trafficking charges, is linked to China’s attempts to exacerbate tensions with Australia, a vehement opponent of the death penalty. It’s not hard to see a precedent. Two Canadians were sentenced to death on drug trafficking charges last year in China, during a row with Canada over the arrest of the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Canadian attempts to plead for clemency for Robert Schellenberg and Fan Wei have so far been unsuccessful. China has also detained two other Canadians, including a former diplomat, on spying charges. Their arrests are also believed to have been in retaliation for Meng’s arrest. More than 100 Australians remain under arrest in China, mostly on drug trafficking and fraud charges. Those waiting to learn their fate include writer Dr Yang Hengjun, who was detained in January 2019 and faces one count of espionage, which he emphatically denies. He has been denied access to his lawyers and family.
Regardless of Beijing’s provocations, Mr Morrison is right to emphasise that “what Australia will always do is act in our national interests, in accordance with our values’’. And when it comes to multiculturalism, freedom of religion, liberty and treating everybody equally, he was “happy to stack Australia’s record up all around the world”.
Trade Minister Simon Birmingham’s frustration over China’s unwillingness to “come to the table” to discuss trade tensions over China’s blocking of Australian beef and barley is well founded. Senators Payne and Birmingham have also been unable to challenge China’s attempts to stop its students from studying in Australia because their ministerial counterparts refuse to take their calls. Time will tell how many students ignore their government’s advice given all that Australia has to offer in terms of academic quality and a safe, clean environment where the threat of COVID-19 has been minimised. Communist diehards surrounding President Xi Jinping doubtless remain peeved over Australia’s initiative that saw the World Health Assembly vote unanimously in favour of an independent inquiry into the Wuhan virus. Faced with global isolation, China was left with no alternative but to throw in the towel and agree. The latest outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing’s main meat and vegetable market makes China’s trenchant opposition to the inquiry suggested by Mr Morrison look even more fatuous.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Young lives neglected and lost	The Australian	The deaths of three Indigenous girls must trigger reforms
Whatever coroner Greg Cavanagh’s findings, the inquest in the Northern Territory into the tragic deaths of three teenage girls is an alarming wake-up call. Evidence given in the court suggests little has improved since the NT emergency intervention began in 2007. Mr Cavanagh is investigating the deaths by hanging of Fionica Yarranganlagi James, Keturah Cheralyn Mamarika and Layla “Gulum” Leering in unrelated incidents in 2016 and 2017. Aged 15 to 17, each was a victim of serious crimes that should have been pursued by authorities.
Child protection, health and education agencies missed warning signs and failed to intervene, as Amos Aikman reported. Two of the girls sought contraception and treatment for STIs at age 12 or 13. The inquest heard all three were molested; two were found dead with “fresh genital injuries”. Counsel assisting, Kelvin Currie, told the inquest Keturah had probably been raped by three males when she was 12; Fionica was raped by an older man when she was 14. Layla, he said, was likely raped by a young male who lived in the same house. As Aikman reported, the court has been packed with departmental executives, advisers and lawyers, with witnesses proffering mea culpas on behalf of their agencies. Territory Families reportedly missed evidence of Keturah being gang-raped. A senior education bureaucrat admitted her department “ could have done more to support these children’’. Apologies will not suffice. If three non-Indigenous girls were found hanged after such trauma, demands for action would be intense. Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt is right to consider mandatory reporting requirements for adults who find out children have sexually transmitted infections. Such warnings should not be ignored. It is a “sad indictment that all tiers of government have not ... come to grips with protecting children’’ from high levels of abuse, as Mr Wyatt says.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
WHO an expensive lame duck	The Australian	The defence of China’s wet markets is surely the last straw
The World Health Organisation’s deranged defence of China’s notorious wet markets, reported on Tuesday, beggars belief. The markets in the city of Wuhan are widely believed to have spawned the COVID-19 pandemic that has infected almost two million people and so far has killed 115,000. It also is devastating the lives and livelihoods of countless more millions across the world, inflicting economic damage that could take decades to repair.
China’s wet markets, described by observers as “cesspits of blood, entrails and excrement”, bring together traditional livestock with other animals, including rats, bats, civets and pangolins. Such creatures are used for food delicacies and in Chinese medicine. In markets, they create ideal conditions for zoonotic diseases to fester and to migrate from animals to humans. The markets are blamed not only for the present catastrophe but also for earlier outbreaks — the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic that emanated from Guangdong and the 2009 swine flu.
For all that, as Ben Packham reports, the view of the WHO’s regional office is that “the WHO does not advocate to prohibit wet markets because they are a source of livelihood to many people and a source of food security to many people. But it is necessary to regulate them and introduce measures to decrease the risk of transmission of diseases at them”. Really? After all that has happened? And could happen again? A leading US infectious diseases authority, Anthony Fauci, has a different view: given the coronavirus is a “direct result” of the unsanitary markets, it is “mind-boggling” that they are being allowed to stay open.
The WHO regards itself as the pre-eminent global health organisation. But it is shredding what remains of that status by its reluctance to take the lead on China’s wet markets. Even Bill Gates’s otherwise well-intentioned, well-argued blueprint for a co-ordinated global approach to fighting the pandemic, published on Monday, looks ill-conceived when it refers to a leading role for the see-nothing, do-nothing WHO. As Mr Gates said, pandemics are a reminder that humanity is bound together not only by common values and social ties. “We’re also connected biologically, by a microscopic network of germs that links the health of one person to the health of everyone else,” he said. “In this pandemic we are all connected. Our response must be, too.” In leading the world in its fight against the pandemic, the WHO should be leaving Beijing, as a repeat offender in global health calamities, in no doubt about the overwhelming responsibility it bears to deal decisively with the threat posed by the wet markets.
The WHO’s nonchalance, however, reflects the craven attitude of its Ethiopian director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has shown himself from the start to be an apologist for China’s self-serving mishandling of the Wuhan outbreak. One of Dr Tedros’s first acts after getting the WHO’s top job in 2017 was to nominate Zimbabwe’s former dictator, Robert Mugabe, a Beijing favourite, as the organisation’s goodwill ambassador. Dr Tedros also has slavishly enforced China’s determination to keep Taiwan out of the WHO, despite it showing itself to be the most successful country in the world in dealing with the pandemic.Scott Morrison has demanded that China and the WHO, to which Australia is due to give $16m in 2020-21, “do something” about the wet markets. So has the Trump administration and the governments of other nations as they struggle to cope with tens of thousands of cases of COVID-19 and mounting death tolls. As Wuhan reopens, so are its wet markets, again endangering countless lives.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Trump at crucial turning point	The Australian	The dilemma is how much of the village to destroy to save it
Donald Trump has set himself up for a “Sophie’s choice”, declaring he would love to see the US economy “opened up and just raring to go by Easter” in two weeks. COVID-19 cases in the US have surged to 70,000, including more than 11,000 on a single day this week, and are fast approaching Italy’s and even China’s grim totals. More than 1000 Americans have died. Leaders of the US medical profession were horrified by the President’s tweet in which he warned, in capitals: “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.” The initial 15 days of national social distancing in the US is due to end on Monday, when the White House will review its strategy. Mr Trump needs to avoid hasty, ill-considered moves that could make matters worse. But he also has reason to worry about the economic fallout of the virus. Last month’s US jobless rate, 3.5 per cent, was the lowest in 50 years. But as much of the economy shuts down, it is heading towards its highest level since the Depression, possibly 20 per cent. Economists expect US GDP to slump by up to 10 per cent in the June quarter.
Conscious of the difficulties of campaigning for re-election in the midst of a deep recession, Mr Trump says Americans need to get back to work: “Our people are full of vim and vigour and energy. They don’t want to be locked into a house or an apartment or some space. It’s not for our country and we are not built that way.” After copping widespread and heavy criticism, even from supporters, for his ill-considered, dismissive early responses to the virus, Mr Trump now faces the most difficult decisions of his presidency. He will be searching for a balance between protecting the US against surging virus numbers and resuming the commerce and business crucial to getting people back to work and the US economy moving. As Washington correspondent Cameron Stewart wrote on Thursday, if he pushes too hard, too fast, to ease social-distancing guidelines and get people back to work, he risks a massive spike in infections and a death toll that could paralyse and devastate the country.
On the other hand, if he heeds doctors’ advice and opts for “an abundance of caution” for too long, he will be left with an economy caught in a downturn not seen since the Depression. Such an outcome would cause enormous misery and likely kill his re-election prospects, although Joe Biden is struggling to gain traction with attention focused on the virus.
A deep hole in the US economy would undermine its strength in the world. “You don’t have to be an insane conspiracy theorist to think that the balance of relations between Washington and Beijing will be irrevocably changed by the economic response to an epidemic that started in the Chinese heartland,” former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Gerard Baker wrote.The US and its allies stand to pay a high price if Mr Trump gets it wrong.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
States must defend public health from mob rule	The Australian	The double standard is intolerable for business and staff
If state leaders have a scintilla of common sense and respect for the public, they will lock in behind Scott Morrison’s call for people continuing to protest to be charged with breaking social-distancing rules. “You can’t have a double standard here,” as the Prime Minister says. Nobody is disputing the importance of the democratic right to protest. But not when it endangers lives, livelihoods and the national economy, especially our most disadvantaged citizens. The wilfulness and selfishness of protesters have enraged most Australians, who for months have made painful sacrifices, personal and material, for the greater good.
Friday’s national cabinet meeting is an ideal opportunity for leaders to unite ahead of further demonstrations. West Australian Premier Mark McGowan, in particular, should take a tough stand. He has urged organisers of Saturday’s Black Lives Matter protest in Perth to postpone the event after a Victorian man contracted coronavirus at a rally in Melbourne last weekend. But Mr McGowan, who seems more interested in keeping WA borders locked down, must show greater determination to deter demonstrators. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Police Commissioner Mick Fuller are giving a lead. Police will be out in force on Friday night, ready to fine participants in a second BLM rally $1000 if they refuse to move along. “Find other ways to protest, like businesses are finding other ways to do business,” as Mr Fuller says. Staying in their driveways, as many people did on Anzac Day, would be an option. NSW police have rightly applied to the Supreme Court to stop a “Free the refugees: National day of action” protest planned for Saturday.
The news that a man who attended Saturday’s BLM protest in Melbourne has tested positive to COVID-19 vindicates the warnings of health officers who pointed out such risks and urged demonstrators to stay home. The infected protester, a man in his 30s, reportedly developed symptoms the day after the event. Given the incubation period for the virus, he is unlikely to have contracted it at the event. But he and others could have passed it on. Time will tell. State authorities, including Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and Victoria Police, stand condemned for their failures to exert sufficient strength of leadership — such as arresting and fining those not complying with social-distancing rules — to send the mob scuttling. A few quiet fishermen on the Mornington Peninsula pier were easier prey. Mr Andrews’s efforts over the protest were tepid. Victoria Police’s claim it was too difficult logistically to fine protesters was absurd.
Mr Morrison says the BLM rallies have delayed the accelerated easing of restrictions by a week. At this stage, we see no need to inflict further financial pain on long-suffering taxpayers, struggling businesses, the unemployed, workers trying to make ends meet and the budget bottom line. The health system, thanks to efforts in testing, tracing and building up supplies of ventilators and personal protective equipment, is well placed to manage further small outbreaks of COVID-19. At this stage there is no sign of a second wave of any magnitude. We agree with the Prime Minister that the states should set a date for reopening their borders and get on with it.
Josh Frydenberg, attuned to economic recovery, is correct when he says it is important to move ahead with the three-steps-by-July timetable on easing restrictions, “because we know how many jobs are going to be created and we know how much the economy will benefit as a result”. But, as the Treasurer says, in gathering in the numbers they did at rallies, protesters put the broader community’s health at risk. Mass gatherings of 10,000 to 30,000 people in confined areas were never envisaged as part of “opening up” after COVID-19. The environment of protests is “very high risk … with large numbers of people closely gathering and challenges in identifying all contacts”, as Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy warns. Well-controlled businesses and their staff have had enough of the “double standard”. Prevented from letting in more customers that would make their operations viable, they have to put up with the sight of noisy mobs flouting the rules as police stand by. The national cabinet needs to show its effectiveness by addressing that injustice — pressing on with opening up the economy and ensuring protests do not jeopardise the process.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Can-do spirit needed to climb out of recession	The Australian	The downturn brings opportunities for overdue reforms Australia has officially but not unexpectedly plunged into historic recession due to the extraordinary measures taken to combat COVID-19. Paradoxically, the steps by government to boost spending and provide support have clouded the picture of what this recession looks like and how quickly and strongly the economy is likely to emerge from it. Much will depend on whether a can-do spirit of co-operation can be fostered and maintained between the commonwealth and states, political parties, business, employees and stakeholders across the board.
Behind Wednesday’s bleak figures are signs of hope that things can bounce back as well as hints of opportunity for long overdue productivity-boosting reform. Australia’s gross domestic product fell by 7 per cent in the June quarter, which was worse than market expectations of a 6 per cent decline but better than forecasts in April at the height of the national lockdown. The quarterly downturn is the worst on record and, on an annualised basis, the worst since 1930-31. The biggest falls in state final demand were in NSW (-8.6 per cent) and Victoria (-8.5 per cent), followed by Tasmania (-7.4 per cent), Western Australia (-6 per cent), Queensland (-5.9 per cent), South Australia (-5.8 per cent), the Northern Territory (-4.9 per cent) and ACT (-2.2 per cent). The quarterly figures capture the strict stage-three national economic shutdown that began in late March and extended through April and into May. Economists say it is uncertain whether the slump ended in the June quarter given the current lockdown in Victoria will be a big drag on activity. It is possible that slightly negative growth will extend into the September quarter.
Getting Victoria, which accounts for 25 per cent of the national economy, out of shutdown and back in business is a priority, as is opening all state borders to get business flowing. The view of economists is that the slump is different from past recessions and the Depression in two key ways. Unlike the recessions of the 1970s, 80s and 90s it was not preceded by a boom. Second, monetary and fiscal stimulus has been big and fast. These factors should enable the economy to bounce back faster. The big question, as economics editor Adam Creighton has written, is what happens when all the support payments, underpinned by borrowed money, largely from overseas, start to dry up. We’re technically in a recession, Creighton says, but it won’t feel like one for many months yet. To illustrate, the odd feature of this recession to date is that households overall have enjoyed a 2.2 per cent increase in gross income.
JobKeeper is designed to allow workers shut out by COVID-19 to return to work when restrictions end. But there still will be economic shocks and potentially a generation of workers who will find it difficult to get a firm step on to the career ladder. The full impact on business when emergency protections for directors are removed and rental and loan repayment holidays and other support measures are wound back is difficult to assess. The longer lockdowns and other measures continue, the more difficult the task of recovery will become. As a result, the government is correct to resist politically opportunistic calls for support measures such as JobKeeper to be made more generous or open-ended.
Tom Dusevic writes that in the COVID recession, the headline unemployment rate is expected to peak at about 10 per cent. Women and young people have felt the brunt of job losses and it will take years to get back to where things were pre-crisis in the labour market. This must be the focus of the October 6 budget. The challenge for all levels of government, once Victoria gets over its health issues, is to devise and deliver a plan for national recovery led by jobs. All groups need to rethink how Australia will do business in the future. A full restoration of free borders is a starting point to allow sectors hardest hit by the recession, including tourism, hospitality and education, to begin the long haul back. If there is a silver lining it could be that the shock provided by Australia’s first recession in almost three decades provides a platform on which to build reform in workplace flexibility and taxation and to boost productivity by harnessing new technologies and the digital economy. All stakeholders need to engage with the economic agenda quickly to get things back to normal. For government, the priority must be how to provide the right conditions for the private sector to generate jobs.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Pearl killer must not walk free	The Australian	The egregious decision by Pakistan’s Supreme Court ordering the release of the notorious jihadist accused of beheading Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002 must not be allowed to stand. Pakistan’s government has appealed to the court to review its decision. On Thursday, a panel of three judges acquitted British-born Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, 47, and his three co-accused. The court ordered they be released if not required in other cases.
As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, the prospect that Sheikh, a London School of Economics-educated terrorist, will walk free is “an affront to terrorism victims everywhere”. It would also be a setback for press freedom and the right of reporters to work, and proof of the continuing link between Islamist extremism and the security services of a country that claims to be a Western ally in fighting terror and a recipient of vast Western aid. Sheikh has connections with Pakistan’s double-dealing military elite and the inner circles of al-Qa’ida. In 1994 he abducted a group of British tourists in Indian Kashmir. In jail, he read biographies of Hitler and Stalin and was stridently anti-Semitic (Mr Pearl was Jewish). After the 1999 hijacking of an Indian aircraft he was released to the Taliban in Afghanistan. For arranging the meeting that led to Mr Pearl’s capture, Sheikh was sentenced to death. But the Supreme Court now appears to accept 9/11 mastermind Khaled Sheikh Mohammed wielded the sword that decapitated Mr Pearl. It is inconceivable that Sheikh walks free. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan must be left in no doubt his begging-bowl nation will pay a high price if Sheikh is freed.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Coronavirus reveals both vulnerability and strength	The Australian	The epidemic is a test of our systems and China dependence
No developed nation has benefited more from the economic rise of China this century than Australia. What we produce — efficiently, reliably and at the right price — is what the world’s most populous nation needs. We’ve become richer off the back of the China success story. But, as many observers fear, we’ve also succumbed to complacency, failing to retool our economy to raise and sustain our living standards for the longer term. Around one-third of our exports go to China, and the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan has shown up vulnerabilities in our export prices, company profits, national income and government revenues. There are disruptions to global supply chains hitting importers, such as retailers, and growing fears that China’s coal and liquefied natural gas demand could sink.
As Scott Morrison said on Thursday, it’s difficult to model the likely fallout from the virus because of information gaps. Previous geomedical crises, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, can give us only a partial picture. After a sharp slowdown in output, China roared back as the outbreak was contained and Beijing pump-primed its economy. But China is a far bigger player now, enmeshed into the world economic order. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, a card-carrying optimist, believes the global spillovers could be larger than in 2003. Writing to state treasurers, Josh Frydenberg said the Chinese economy was now four times larger than it was in 2003. Economists at Commonwealth Bank say the implication from falling commodity prices is that Australia’s “rare” current account surplus will vanish and the budget surplus pencilled in for this financial year will prove elusive. CBA chief economist Michael Blythe notes the “twin surpluses” are useful protections in uncertain times.
Economists believe the tourism industry will be hit first and hardest. The Prime Minister said international tourism fell by 11 per cent in a quarter in the SARS era but was followed by a 16 per cent jump the next quarter. China’s share of our tourist market has grown sevenfold since then. More Australians today travel abroad than we receive in foreign visitors. Given the low dollar, it’s possible more of us will holiday at home, easing the heavy losses of businesses already affected by the bushfires. Universities could lose $2bn in fees if the 100,000 students stranded in China can’t return, according to an analysis by ratings agency S&P. While this is disruptive for institutions, and personally distressing for students, they will eventually return to complete their degrees and diplomas.
Mr Morrison took decisive action in imposing the travel ban last Saturday, knowing full well there would be an impact on the tourism, education and other export sectors, as well as some diplomatic blowback. The detention by Border Force officers at Australian airports on Sunday of 74 Chinese students, who were in transit when the ban came into effect, provoked a “not happy” reaction from Beijing’s deputy ambassador. Beijing sees the travel bans on its citizens, here and elsewhere, as a “vicious cycle of panic and over-reaction”. Education Minister Dan Tehan said these were “extraordinarily unusual circumstances”. Getting the balance right won’t be easy. Our authorities must maintain the dialogue with universities, students, global agencies and other governments.
But the Morrison government was right to put public safety at the heart of its moves. The travel ban was made on the medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, which relied on infectious disease specialists and mathematical modelling. As Health Minister Greg Hunt said, national health security is the driver of these decisions. In fact, Canberra has been at the forefront of global action with its 14-day quarantine period for Hubei province. The onus also has been put on citizens travelling from non-affected areas in China to isolate themselves at home. Local services are supporting this “containment approach”. With further evacuations from China likely to exceed the capacity of Christmas Island, isolated mining camps and hotels are being identified as temporary quarantine centres for the citizens returning from coronavirus hot spots.
Yet the scale of the coronavirus outbreak, and how long it will last, is unknown. It may be early days, or not. The world is at the mercy of Beijing, an uncomfortable thought at the best of times because of the communist state’s record of tight information control and rampant propaganda. As China correspondent Will Glasgow reported on Thursday, President Xi Jinping has dispatched a 300-strong PR army to “strengthen public opinion guidance”. The Xi regime has two speeds — cover-up and over-reaction, notes Alan Kohler — neither of which helps in this crisis. China’s bureaucratic culture, prioritising stability over all else, has most likely allowed the virus to spread.We are in a delicate spot. Tough action has an economic cost — for quarantine facilities, medical care, lost production, a fall in export earnings and general confidence. As Paul Kelly explained on Wednesday, “the China epidemic is striking at the foundations of the government’s economic stance”. Relatively strong public finances, clear communication and sound institutions all work in our favour. A balanced budget in Canberra is a much better starting point than carrying big deficits. “We’ll do whatever is necessary to keep Australians safe,” Mr Morrison said on Thursday. GDP growth will be dented this quarter, but over the long haul we need to diversify our exports, fatten our safety buffers and lift our policy game.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Anti-corruption watchdog must not usurp the courts	The Australian	The excesses of other quasi-judicial bodies are to be avoided
Attorney-General Christian Porter’s draft legislation for a Commonwealth Integrity Commission to investigate allegations of corruption among federal politicians, their staff, bureaucrats and law enforcement and security agency officers is causing a stir. After a highly partisan clamour for the federal equivalent of the various state anti-corruption watchdogs, the Morrison government is acceding to the demands. The proposed bill must meet a real policy need. It must not be merely a conciliatory gesture to the vociferous Twitter lynch mob, which rails against “sports rorts” by the federal Coalition while expressing supine solidarity with Premier Daniel Andrews for giving hotel quarantine security contracts to private firms that led to the crippling spread of COVID-19 throughout Victoria.
Claims of corruption can appear to be in the eye of the beholder. Government by Labor mates for Labor mates in Queensland sparks no outrage from those demanding Angus Taylor be placed in the stocks over his handling of water licensing. Journalists who mouth pious words about freedom of the press and protecting sources sometimes demand unlimited powers of surveillance and coercion by shadowy bodies with extraordinary powers to eavesdrop on anyone about whom they entertain the merest suspicion. How many journalists risk being ensnared by wire taps as they quiz highly placed political sources?
The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption and its equivalents have elevated a handful of barristers to the status of celebrity custodians of the public interest. Yet their impact on serious corruption, especially in local government where it is at most risk of flourshing in the darkness, has been unconvincing. Indeed, it has been disproportionate to the destruction of careers and reputations of those ultimately vindicated by genuine courts of justice. Former NSW premier Nick Greiner and barrister Margaret Cunneen SC, for example, suffered humiliation and harm to their reputations before ICAC findings were set aside by properly constituted courts. Mr Porter showed on Monday that he has learned important lessons from the worst excesses of the state anti-corruption bodies, especially ICAC and its counterpart in Western Australia. By insisting that CIC hearings be conducted in private, he has recognised that show trials often harm the innocent while achieving nothing commensurate to the damage inflicted on confidence in the political system.
For Australians who cherish liberties derived from the best US and British models, this has been a challenging year. Forgoing a US style bill of rights, our founders opted for the British model of responsible government, in which the popularly elected parliament is supreme. Parliamentarians enjoy privileges to raise allegations, free from defamation laws. Standing committees, Senate estimates and other existing mechanisms, including the Auditor-General, are equipped with powers to interrogate public officials. Government ministers face rigorous hostile examination by the opposition in question time. The answer to corrupt governance lies in the people electing a new government. It is not sentimental to argue our system serves Australia admirably, as do the courts. Justice is generally done and seen to be done. No system is perfect. However, ours deserves to be defended.
The proliferation of quasi-judicial Star Chambers, providing fodder for Twitter agitators, was not contemplated when our parliamentary democracy and the separation of executive, legislative and judicial powers was devised. Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers want public hearings and for the proposed body to be empowered to initiate its own inquiries. That would create a monster. Such a body has no place in a society in which the rule of law and the presumption of innocence are foundational principles. Those demanding show trials by a body not legally constituted as a court should be careful what they wish for. Ask Mr Greiner. If Labor and the Greens seek to impose such provisions, Mr Porter would do well to kill the bill.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Treasury faces $60bn question	The Australian	The extraordinary bungle has a silver lining for taxpayers One of the biggest budget accounting errors in memory, by the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office, is deeply embarrassing for the Morrison government, especially Josh Frydenberg. Anthony Albanese and his frontbench are relishing their opponents’ discomfort, with digs claiming the government “couldn’t even run a bath’’ and that the error was so enormous it “could be seen from space”. Beyond the banter, the opposition and a range of interest groups are asking how the $60bn will be spent. There is no shortage of claimants clamouring for the JobKeeper scheme to be extended in favour of the higher education and arts sectors, casual workers and employees of foreign companies. The government is right to resist such pressure, and should continue to do so.
The $60bn is not money sitting in the bank, as Scott Morrison said yesterday. It is money that the government would otherwise have had to borrow, against the taxes that will be paid by this and future generations. The fact that the $1500-a-fortnight JobKeeper scheme is supporting 3.5 million workers rather than the anticipated 6.5 million people is a positive sign. More employers and staff have managed to continue business as usual, albeit with more working from home, during the lockdown.
There is no reason, at this stage, to extend the scope or duration of the generous JobKeeper scheme, which is scheduled to end on September 24.
On principle, decisions to spend billions of extra dollars should not be made because it is possible to spend money. Outlays should be made because they are required in the public interest. Extra caution is needed in spending borrowed money, especially during a major economic shock such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Hours before news emerged on Friday that the budget outlook had ­improved by $60bn, one of the world’s top three credit ratings agencies, Fitch, warned that it might cut Australia’s coveted AAA rating. It cited concerns about Australia’s soaring debt and deficits incurred through the massive stimulus programs enacted to offset the fallout from the coronavirus. It is “welcome news that the impact on the public purse from the (JobKeeper) program will not be as great as initially ­estimated” as the Treasurer says. The program, established as a temporary lifeline for businesses and their staff, is due to be reviewed at the end of June. Anomalies such as lower-paid workers receiving far more money per fortnight under the scheme than they normally do in wages need to be addressed. The Treasury bureaucracy needs to examine how such a major mistake happened. The error suggests lessons need to be learned about why the modelling showing JobKeeper would likely be deployed to support about 6.5 million workers was so far wide of the mark. Much of the problem appears to stem from the ATO forms filled out by employers. About 1000 businesses made errors when reporting their estimates of eligible employees on their enrolment forms. Instead of reporting the ­number of employees they expected to be eligible, they reported the amount of assistance they ­expected to receive. In some cases, as Mr Frydenberg writes on Monday, they wrote 3000 instead of two. The subsidy will cost $70bn rather than $130bn. While embarrassing, at least the error is on the right side of the ledger.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Covid no match for the Cup	The Australian	The exuberance of our national spirit carried the day
The stands and lawns of Flemington were empty, the Birdcage deserted, and the strappers wore masks as they led their magnificent chargers around the parade yard. Not an outlandish hat was in sight. On a glorious spring day after a winter of discontent in Melbourne, the pandemic could not stop the race that stops the nation. Australians know it is something to celebrate that one of the annual events that unites us is not about a military victory or a revolution but a horse race. And celebrate we did, albeit COVID safely, in workplaces, pubs, halls and homes. We wagered millions in bets and bought sweep tickets in support of good causes — and for the sheer fun of it.
Yet again, the Melbourne Cup was an international event. But it remains as quintessentially Australian as it was when it was run for the first time in November 1861. As always, the experts were wise after the event. And there were plenty of good stories from every stable, joyful and sad. In Ireland, trainer Joseph O’Brien, 27 watched in the small hours as Twilight Payment delivered him his second Cup, beating Tiger Moth, trained by O’Brien’s father, Aidan, into second place. There was tragedy, too, as last year’s Epsom Derby winner Anthony Van Dyck, the topweight and trained by O’Brien Sr, broke down with a fractured fetlock and had to be humanely put down. The sport of kings was never risk free for beast or man. Despite the absence of 90,000 cheering spectators as he returned to the enclosure on Twilight Payment after leading for almost the entire race, jockey Jye McNeil, contesting his first Cup, had “goose bumps”. Providing winning owner Lloyd Williams with his seventh Cup, McNeil found the experience “very overwhelming”. So did most Australians who love the Cup and who were reassured by the success of the event, however different it felt.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Covid-19 lessons to be learned	The Australian	The failures of Victoria’s response are becoming clearer Too slow and too sloppy, Mr Andrews. As 37 Melbourne suburbs lock down again, at vast cost and frustration to residents, employers and all who normally interact with those in the 10 postcodes affected, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews needs to answer a few hard questions. First is: why has it taken more than a month for his government to overhaul its shambolic hotel quarantine system? And second: why were the three companies involved in overseeing quarantine exempted from a tender process? The first COVID-19 case in a security contractor at the Rydges on Swanston quarantine hotel was made public on May 27. Total cases in that cluster have since risen to 17. A second cluster, linked to 31 cases, including two new cases, emerged after a security contractor at the Stamford Plaza tested positive on June 17.
Mr Andrews says he acted quickly, setting up a judicial review of hotel quarantine and diverting overseas arrivals to other states for the next fortnight. Responsibility for the quarantine shambles must be nailed. But it should have been far sooner, especially as Victoria, ironically, took pride in putting the most draconian clamps on civil liberties early, driving golfers off the course and clearing fishers from their favourite spots.
What is more important than lamenting the Andrews government’s mistakes is learning from them. That applies to all jurisdictions as they also prepare to face mini-outbreaks that governments and health authorities regard as inevitable as Australians learn to live alongside the virus as the economy continues opening up.
NSW is looking ahead, as Yoni Bashan reports. Senior Berejiklian government officials are preparing for a flare-up in cases and, wisely, are ruling out any move back to a full-blown lockdown. They are looking to precision targeting of suburbs, as they did when some schools were closed for a day or two early in the first outbreak. Moving quickly and precise targeting are vital. The limitations of lockdowns are becoming clear. As Rachel Baxendale reports, at least 27 of the latest 73 cases in Melbourne were attributed to local government areas outside the 10 hotspot postcodes in the city’s north and west. But for all the angst, the picture needs to be put in context. Amid 10.5 million cases and 514,000 deaths worldwide, Australia ranks 72nd of nations most affected, with 7900 cases and 104 deaths. In medical terms, we are well prepared for outbreaks. We must also reinforce the value of social distancing and hygiene.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Victoria Police’s abject failure	The Australian	The findings will not console those whose loved ones died Victorian Coroner Jacqui Hawkins did not mince words in her findings from the inquest into the attack by James Gargasoulas, who killed six people, including a 10-year-old girl and a baby boy, in a car rampage in Melbourne’s Bourke Street on January 20, 2017. Gargasoulas was unstoppable by the time he reached the city. But, as the Coroner concluded, the fact he was able to reach Bourke Street arose from “systemic deficiencies” on the part of Victoria Police. These included poor planning, a lack of assertive leadership, inadequate resources, loss of objectivity, and inflexible attitudes and policies. Each factor, Ms Hawkins concluded, contributed to “a perfect storm”.
Coming on the heels of the Lawyer X debacle, the inquest findings should make disturbing reading for Chief Commissioner Shane Patton, Police Minister Lisa Neville and the Andrews government. On Thursday, Mr Patton conceded “some shortcomings in our operational response”. But the police involved acted in good faith, based on the information available to them, he said. There had never been a hostile vehicle attack in Australia, he pointed out; nobody could have predicted the outcome. That’s cold comfort for families still grieving loved ones.
The precise events that unfolded in Bourke Street were “unforeseeable”, as Ms Hawkins concluded. But, she noted, police knew Gargasoulas was violent and had an extensive history of baiting police and dangerous driving. It was “agonising”, she said, that despite the events of the days leading up to the attack, and scores of police actively engaged in attempting to stop Gargasoulas, the “violent, drug-­fuelled, psychotic and delusional criminal was able to slip through the cracks and evade interception by police over several hours”. Gargasoulas’ behaviour in the lead-up to January 20, the inquest found, was “consistently dangerous, violent and unpredictable”. It included a violent assault on January 18 and stabbing his brother, Angelo, early on January 20.
Evidence about the police response after the stabbing was “marked by blame-shifting and standing behind the limits of roles, which were often expressed in imprecise terms”, Ms Hawkins said. Police tracked Gargasoulas through South Melbourne, where he narrowly avoided hitting pedestrians. But the police failure to call a pursuit prevented formal supervision or oversight. Ms Hawkins’s recommendations will improve procedures and sharpen the handling of critical incidents. On the positive side, most of the recommendations already have been implemented. The Victoria Police service has far to go, however, to re-establish public trust.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Commission implicates Pell	The Australian	The freed cardinal remains a divisive figure in our culture
It is no surprise redacted chapters of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, tabled in parliament and released on Thursday, are highly critical of Cardinal George Pell. How could they not be? After all, it was the criminal prosecutions against him, some based on allegations of sexual abuse in 1996 and 1997 when he was archbishop of Melbourne, that prevented the royal commission from revealing all the details relating to him when it reported in December 2017. In essence, the commission has rejected key portions of Cardinal Pell’s sworn evidence. It found that by 1973, Father Pell, as he was then, was aware of child abuse being committed by clergy and had considered measures to avoid situations that “might provoke gossip about it”.
More specifically, the commission accused Cardinal Pell of involvement in the 1982 movement from Ballarat to Sydney of serial pedophile Gerald Ridsdale, one of the world’s worst Catholic abusers; as a bishop, failing to recommend the removal of notorious abuser priest Peter Searson in 1989; and not doing enough to stop repeat offender and Christian Brother Ted Dowlan. “We are satisfied that in 1973 Father Pell turned his mind to the prudence of Ridsdale taking boys on overnight camps,” the commission found. But the commission rejected several other claims that were levelled at Cardinal Pell; it found it was unlikely he offered a bribe in 1993 to David Ridsdale, the nephew of the priest who offended hundreds of times against children from the 1960s to the 80s.
In an interview after being released from prison last month, following a unanimous High Court acquittal, Cardinal Pell said he did not expect a harsh verdict from the commission. He saw himself as “scapegoat” for the church’s failings. In a statement on Thursday, he said he “was surprised by some of the views of the royal commission about his actions” and that these views are “not supported by evidence”. To be clear, the standards of the commission are not the same as in criminal trials. In Ballarat at the time of the Ridsdale offending, Father Pell was a junior priest. As John Ferguson writes, the man most culpable for what happened in the diocese was corrupt and cavalier Ronald Mulkearns, the bishop who consigned hundreds of children to lives of misery. Yet it defies belief the larger-than-life cleric, who is proud of the 1996 Melbourne Response — the redress scheme for allegations of sexual abuse within the church — could have been so passive and clueless about what had been happening around him.On these occasions, when the names of monstrous offenders are mentioned and painful memories are revived, we think of the victims of these crimes and their families. Their hurt is enduring and made worse when churches seek to dodge basic obligations. The royal commission, established in 2013, exposed the wicked neglect of once-trusted institutions, which should have been protecting children. Instead they, and the police, looked the other way. Or, worse, enabled the abuse to occur for decades. That is a stain on our collective history, with grief and rage everlasting. A divisive figure in our culture, though innocent of the sexual abuse that put him behind bars for 13 months, Cardinal Pell will remain entwined with the sins of the Catholic Church he once led and personified. As Ferguson writes, he “has escaped jail but his reputation is on bail”.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
China’s campus mischief is a security wake-up call	The Australian	The government faces a complex challenge to our interests
Sharri Markson and Kylar Loussikian’s expose of scientists in our universities plugged into a secretive, strategic operation of the Chinese Communist Party is sobering and calls for a carefully thought through response from the Morrison government. This under-the-radar co-option of taxpayer-funded expertise and research by a foreign power has obvious implications for national security at a time of intensifying geopolitical conflict.
Our investigative reports show dozens of researchers at major universities have been recruited to a CCP program called the Thousand Talents Plan, which fits into longstanding attempts by China to harness by whatever method necessary the innovation and technology of the outside world to strengthen its own position in the great power rivalry that obsesses the regime, especially under President-for-life Xi Jinping. Academics in our higher education system have been given an extra funding stream from this CCP program and patents flowing from research here in Australia have ended up with Chinese entities. In some cases our universities were oblivious to this, and at first denied it was happening when contacted by The Australian. The risks and conflicts are obvious and unacceptable. Universities have announced reviews, as they should, but the ultimate responsibility to ensure proper safeguards lies with the federal government, which clearly needs more effective, expert and well-resourced oversight in this area.
These are not easy issues. Universities and the federal Treasury have had strong financial incentives to maximise links with Chinese institutions and to smooth over irritants and obstacles in bilateral relationships. The higher education business model is built largely on the China market, and fee income from mainland students has driven a booming services export industry. It’s also the case that international research collaboration is a good thing and does not have to be a zero-sum exercise. In the same way, ethnic Chinese expatriates in our universities make a significant contribution not only through their research but as go-betweens and enablers of productive joint projects. Unfortunately, as Chinese-Australians themselves have been quick to point out, the regime under Mr Xi has shown that it is all too willing to put first its own narrow interests and chauvinistic ambitions, to regard ethnic Chinese wherever they are as owing loyalty to the CCP’s hegemonic project, and to treat the intellectual property of open democracies as something to be exploited, including by theft and deception. Even if universities did not have financial reasons to downplay these risks, the task of policing interventions such as the Thousand Talents Plan is a headache. International research is a process of exchange more complex than the export of iron ore. So-called blue-sky research, with no immediately obvious military or strategic value, can end up having very pointy applications. And there are important fields, such as materials science and sensor technology, where there is a multiplicity of real-world uses, some innocuous and some militarily momentous. Universities thrive with openness, not suspicion, yet they have to contend with an authoritarian regime that seeks to harness all human activity to its accumulation of power, and does so with great skill in the dark arts of covert statecraft.
These dilemmas are not new, and both the university sector and government have insisted that they had in place adequate yet flexible rules and policies to manage the risks. That won’t wash any more. Troubling evidence of the range and depth of foreign interference by China in Australia has mounted up remarkably quickly. Two related changes will apply severe pressure to politicians and vice-chancellors to become much more active and successful in protecting our national interests. The first is that Mr Xi has proven right the sceptics who doubted that China’s economic opening would reform its politics and render it a benign and co-operative international partner. From territorial provocation through cyber attacks and hostage-taking to industrial-scale human rights abuse, the CCP regime has forced many people, Australians especially, to give up illusions or indifference about the rising power of China. The high-stakes conflict between the US and China, with Australia caught in the middle, is undeniable. The second change is driven by the economic catastrophe of COVID-19. As this social pain deepens, Australians will not tolerate institutions — political or educational — that fail to serve our national interests effectively, and this will require an elimination of incompetence, waste, abuses and conflicts. A higher education system drawing on public funds and having its work diverted to serve an oppressive regional bully is a state of affairs that voters will not accept.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Small gains on a long road to economic recovery	The Australian	The government has done well but it must tackle structural reform In more ordinary times a budget deficit of $197.7bn, equivalent to 9 per cent of gross domestic product, would give little cause for celebration. In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, however, the otherwise eye-watering number represents an improvement on the more pessimistic expectations of only weeks ago. Together with new data showing unemployment is expected to peak at 7.5 per cent in the March quarter next year, down from an expected peak of 8 per cent, the mid-year financial update delivered on Thursday by Josh Frydenberg shows that things slowly are getting back on track.
Australia’s real GDP grew by 3.3 per cent in the September quarter after a fall of 7 per cent in the June quarter this year. On a calendar-year basis, real GDP is forecast to grow by 4.5 per cent next year following a fall of 2.5 per cent this year. Rising housing prices and improvements in consumer and business confidence give some promise that the economic recovery will continue to strengthen in the new year.
Announcing the revised budget figures, the Treasurer said Australia was outperforming all advanced economies. Internationally, there has been a loss of momentum because of a resurgence in COVID-19 infections. After falling by 4 per cent this year, global GDP is forecast to increase by 4.75 per cent next year. Australia’s relatively better financial performance is due to its success in suppressing the virus, which is still out of control in many parts of Europe and the US. Australia’s major trading partners are forecast to grow by 5.35 per cent next year following a fall of 2.5 per cent this year.
Mr Frydenberg was quick to caution that the road ahead was challenging. “We have not defeated the virus,” he said. “It still is with us.” To emphasis the point, health authorities in NSW have been on high alert to contact trace and contain a COVID-19 outbreak in Sydney’s northern beaches. The source of the infection is believed to have been a musician who had performed across a wide area. As of Thursday the number of confirmed infections was 17 and authorities had advised residents from the Spit to Palm Beach to stay inside if possible.
Talk of renewed border closures by trigger-happy state governments is one of the significant impediments to rebuilding economic momentum. With state borders now open, the labour market continues to strengthen alongside the recovery in economic activity. About 85 per cent of the 1.3 million people who lost their job or were stood down on zero hours in April are back at work. The unemployment rate is now forecast to fall to 6.25 per cent in the June quarter of 2022, mirroring the view of the Reserve Bank of Australia that getting employment levels back to those before the pandemic will take several years. It took six years for the unemployment rate to recover to its pre-recession level in the 1980s and 10 years to do so in the 90s. This time, Treasury thinks the lost ground will be made up in four years. Nonetheless, this should ensure that interest rates stay low for an extended period regardless of what happens to housing prices.
A faster-than-expected return to work mainly has been responsible for a $15.9bn improvement in the government’s underlying cash balance, bringing the deficit below $200bn. The $15.9bn saving is welcome but, as Tom Dusevic writes, it is merely a rounding error when you realise Canberra’s spending is going to be $2.4 trillion across four years, or 100 times the clawback. Deficits represent additional borrowings. At some point a reckoning will have to be made with the huge level of debt being accumulated. With interest rates low it is a good time for government to borrow if the money is spent wisely. The downgrade of AAA credit ratings for NSW and Victoria is a reminder that economic norms have not been abandoned completely. With this in mind it is important that the government remains focused on moving past the pandemic and back to a more normal budgetary position. This will require structural reforms including in the hard-fought areas of industrial relations and tax. It also will require some good fortune in the successful rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine to allow the resumption of global travel, and a clearer picture on how future trade relations will be managed with China. The government has done a good job so far in managing the pandemic and it is correct to maintain support until the global outlook is more clear. When the pandemic has passed, the budget repair work must start in earnest.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Time for action on uni speech	The Australian	The government has the whip hand and the high moral ground
The great legal scholar Ronald Dworkin observed “any invasion of academic freedom is not only harmful in itself, but also makes future invasions more likely”. To his credit federal Education Minister Dan Tehan recognises that there has been a steady erosion of free speech and academic freedom on Australian campuses. It preceded this government. However, it must be dealt with by the Morrison government to prevent the “long march through the institutions” becoming a fait accompli. The time for decisive action has arrived.
The minister has commissioned two substantial reviews into academic freedom on our campuses. The first by former Australian High Court chief justice Robert French was handed to the government in April last year. Mr French found that free speech and academic freedom required stronger protection. He provided a so-called “model code” for the tertiary sector to implement voluntarily. Subsequently Mr Tehan commissioned another review, by former Deakin University vice-chancellor Sally Walker, to determine the extent to which the universities had adopted the model code. As Richard Ferguson reports today, Professor Walker’s findings are disturbing. Only nine of 42 universities have fully adopted the model code. This is a damning indictment of our universities. The time for reviews and voluntary codes of practice has passed.
While Professor Walker has made well-intentioned recommendations about more transparency in reporting and adoption of uniform standards, it is clear that the universities respond more readily to sticks than carrots. The Morrison government needs to act to ensure that the tertiary sector operates in a fashion commensurate with the generous support it receives from the taxpayer. Universities are not merely degree-conferring institutions. They occupy a particular role in nurturing the great Enlightenment project that has shaped the West. It is not fanciful to suggest that the health of our democracy can be gauged by the degree to which our higher education institutions inculcate values of diversity of thought, freedom of debate and genuine intellectual inquiry. Based on the reviews by Mr French and Professor Walker, they have failed that test. Their heel dragging to this point inspires no confidence that they will implement meaningful change.
The government needs to legislate to enforce a code. It has the power of the purse and the legislative tools to do so. Nothing better epitomises the conformist climate on our campuses than the appalling treatment of Peter Ridd by James Cook University. Professor Ridd reluctantly became the focal point in the battle for intellectual freedom on our campuses following his termination by JCU. Unfortunately, this was upheld by the full Federal Court of Australia and awaits ultimate adjudication by the High Court. That there is a crisis of intellectual freedom and freedom of speech in universities is beyond dispute and the Ridd case is but the most conspicuous symptom of the malaise. For years the anecdotal evidence has mounted of trigger warnings, safe spaces and the “no platforming” of figures such as Bettina Arndt who challenge the modern canon of identity politics.
The pandemic exposed the dysfunctional business model of our tertiary sector. It had become too reliant on the lucrative market of foreign students. This created a climate where our vice-chancellors became more concerned with revenue than with academic rigour. Sensitivity to criticism of China by the University of Queensland and the University of NSW amply demonstrates this vulnerability. The Morrison government must not waste the current crisis in university earnings. It should tie funding under the Higher Education Support Act for universities to their formal adoption of guarantees of free speech and inquiry. Mere recommendations will be met with the same insouciance that has characterised their response to date. Our vice-chancellors have revealed that they are compliant when money is at stake. The government holds the purse strings and the moral high ground on freedom of speech. It must act.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
PM’s Covid vaccine deal heralds a ‘day of hope’	The Australian	The government is putting the nation ahead of the pack
Scott Morrison has tapped into the nation’s mindset and lifted our spirits with his announcement that his government has locked in a deal for the Aust­ralia-wide supply of the world’s first potential COVID-19 vaccine. Under a letter-of-intent with Britain-based drug company AstraZeneca, every Australian will be offered the University of Oxford vaccine for free early next year or even late this year, provided it proves successful. It remains unproven technology but its efficacy in terms of developing antibodies against coronavirus has been shown and its safety demonstrated in phase one and phase two trials. There is no guarantee, of course, that the Oxford or any other vaccine will be successful, as the Prime Minister said. That is why the government is continuing discussions with other developers and backing Australian researchers, such as the University of Queensland, in the quest for a vaccine.
After 22 million COVID cases worldwide and 780,000 deaths, including 450 in Australia, few would disagree with Mr Morrison that a vaccine should be “as mandatory as you could possibly make it”, while allowing for medical exemptions. He is aiming for a take-up rate of at least 95 per cent. That should be achievable given concerns about COVID contagion and Australians’ appreciation of the benefits of immunisation against measles, mumps and rubella, flu, cervical cancer and other illnesses. Amid repressive state border closures, Victoria’s stage four lockdown and grim figures about the coronavirus death rate in nursing homes and its decimating effect on jobs, aviation and other industries, our COVID discourse desperately needed a change of gear. Mr Morrison has provided it, offering realistic hope of deliverance from the nation’s and the world’s worst health crisis in a century and the worst economic crisis since the Depression.
Australian biotechnology company CSL, the largest company on the Australian Securities Exchange, backs Mr Morrison’s optimism. CSL expects to have an effective anti-COVID vaccine ready by the middle of next year. The company is continuing its partnership with UQ, which has a vaccine in phase one trials. CSL and UQ have “tightened the timeline” on the project. CSL also has signed an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy or manufacture the Oxford vaccine in Australia. CSL chief executive Paul Perreault says no single vaccine or therapy will defeat COVID-19. For that reason, CSL is deploying resources on three fronts: partnering with UQ, potentially manufacturing the Oxford vaccine, and developing hyperimmune treatment for the most serious cases of the virus. Its efforts, and those of about 160 vaccine projects under way around the world, 30 of which have reached the stage of clinical trials, offer desperately needed hope as coronavirus continues to spread. The widespread, almost unprecedented collaboration between industries, government and researchers in search of a vaccine is a bright spot. And it underlines the increasing importance of scientific research.
Conscious of the spread of coronavirus in developing nations, Mr Morrison has taken a responsible stand in promising Australia will support our regional neighbours in acquiring vaccines for their people. He has already discussed vaccines with Indonesian President Joko Widodo and the leaders of Fiji and Papua New Guinea. But until research is finalised and vaccines manufactured and distributed, efforts to contain COVID-19 through social distancing and hygiene must continue diligently and consistently. So must efforts to save lives with best-practice treatments. Victoria’s experience shows how a couple of bad mistakes dealing with such a contagious virus can escalate into a full-blown disaster within days. After the strangest six months most Australians have ever lived through, especially Melburnians, the idea of returning to normal life, as it was late last year, feels surreal. A vaccine holds out the promise of families and friends being together wherever and whenever; all business sectors gearing up to full throttle; stepping into crowded areas without a qualm; being out and about freely; flying interstate and overseas; uninterrupted school and university terms, and the return of international students. It also offers hope that the current ongoing economic destruction can be curtailed as soon as possible. Most of all, the prospect of a vaccine offers hope of life without a lurking fear of COVID-19.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Manufacturing policy can’t neglect basic reform tasks	The Australian	The government is up against real challenges and won’t find it easy
The contrast between beggar-thy-neighbour vaccine nationalism in Europe and Australia’s good fortune in being able to make the AstraZeneca vaccine in Melbourne naturally encourages enthusiasm about more manufacturing Down Under. As Tom Dusevic wrote on Saturday: “The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable supply chains can be and has changed the conversation around sovereign manufacturing capability and building resilience to shocks. Industry policy is again in vogue, especially in the niche worlds of business lobbying, policy development and scientific research.” It’s not only COVID or its pandemic successors that threaten supply chains. China’s regional power plays, and the heightened risk of hot war, mean we must consider the risk of disrupted supply by sea lanes. It makes sense to give careful thought to sovereign manufacturing capacity and what can be done to give it maximum effect. Key strategic assumptions have unravelled. Not long ago it was widely believed that as globalised trade opened up the economies of authoritarian countries, so too their political systems would liberalise, and ideological rivalry would give way to mutual prosperity. China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, however, have shown that something like market economies can coexist with greater domestic suppression and adventurism abroad of the conventional military kind as well as covert cyber interference. And, as Australia knows only too well, the Chinese Communist Party has reminded everyone that decisions about trade can have punitive political purposes.
Against this background, the Morrison government last year launched its $1.5bn Modern Manufacturing Strategy. The idea is to better harness the efforts of government, business and the research sector to exploit existing advantages, chase emerging opportunities and respond to strategic imperatives. These are all worthy aims, and there’s no doubt Australia tends to underperform in vital areas such as commercialisation of research and high-skill, high-value manufacturing. We do need fresh thinking in radically altered circumstances. But this kind of government-led initiative carries inherent risks, and there may be less patience to get the policy design right at a time of such strategic pressure.
Michael Brennan, chair of the Productivity Commission, explained the risk of industry policy subsidies succinctly in Saturday’s paper: “The problem comes in picking favoured sectors and subsidising selected private businesses. It’s hard for anyone to see clearly where the next big profit opportunities lie, and doubly hard for governments to be sure they are backing proposals that will succeed, but which would not have succeeded but for the government assistance.” He doesn’t dismiss the need to study supply chain weaknesses — early analysis points to potential problems with personal protective equipment, medicines and agricultural production ­chemicals — but he advises a careful and selective approach alert to costs and benefits. The concern is that, supercharged by the rhetoric of a sovereign imperative, the “revival” of manufacturing may be oversold, some sectors and businesses will extract economic rents, opportunities unguessed by less than omniscient policymakers will be deprived of resources, and as ever the taxpayer will be dudded. We have to steer between the two extremes of a naive squandering of subsidies and policy defeatism deaf to new challenges.
The six priority areas set out by Industry Minister Karen Andrews look credible: resources technology, food and beverages, medical products, recycling and clean energy, defence, and space. But translating these broad areas into specific successful projects will not be easy. As Dusevic reported on Saturday, there are teething problems with the signature grants program redolent of past, lacklustre attempts at industry policy. Is the government able to conjure out of the myriad existing and new measures a coherent policy system that will allow promising businesses — especially small-to-medium firms — to navigate ideas and innovations past the red tape towards success?
Sovereign manufacturing has the lustre of novelty but there is no escaping the difficult and familiar task of basic economic reform: a tax system that encourages entrepreneurial risk-taking; an industrial relations system that underpins growth in wages, productivity and employment; and schooling with rigour and excellence that leads to higher education and skill formation built on solid standards. If our political system cannot deliver these, why should we expect it to pull off an advanced manufacturing coup? Only last week, the government’s labour market reforms failed in the Senate. We have debt heading towards $1 trillion and, after a pandemic-leveraged expansion of the state, it is going to be politically difficult to rein in the public sector so that the vital spirits of the private economy can be re-energised. The unexpectedly quick bounceback of employment — so far, anyway — may have created complacency about the challenges ahead. Advanced manufacturing is worth the pursuit but it would help to have some basic economic reform and political focus, beyond the rancour and dysfunction of today’s social media-driven news cycle.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
AFP raid on wrong side of law	The Australian	The government must act to stop such errors recurring
Now the High Court has ruled unanimously that the Australian Federal Police’s raid on the Canberra home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst on June 4 last year was illegal, the Morrison government should bring the shameful mess to a swift end. It needs to rule out the possibility that Smethurst could still be prosecuted for doing her job — to inform Australians on serious matters of public interest, as News Corp Australasia executive chairman Michael Miller said on Wednesday. The 2018 news story that prompted the raid on Smethurst should concern all citizens. It suggested that government departments were considering allowing the nation’s cyber spy agency, the Australian Signals Directorate, to monitor Australians for the first time.
The warrant that authorised the raid on Smethurst’s home was issued by a new magistrate at an uncontested hearing where the only argument heard was that of the AFP. In their decision, the High Court justices found unanimously that the flawed warrant did not specify the offence under investigation. The warrant also misstated the relevant law. The court ordered the AFP to pay the costs of Smethurst and News Corp, publisher of The Australian.
The decision is welcome. But the court invoked no principles about free speech or the public’s right to know. By a majority of 4-3 the High Court also decided not to order the AFP to return the information seized in the raid. Nor will the decision prevent future raids on journalists, based on similar errors by novice magistrates. The only way to prevent such conduct in future will be for the Morrison government to accept the logic of having the AFP applications for search warrants against the media subjected to contestable hearings.
As legal affairs editor Chris Merritt writes on Thursday, providing for contestable warrant hearings would be a modest, procedural change that would confer no special privileges on the media. But allowing media organisations to contest such warrants against journalists would help avoid debacles like this in future.
Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are in poor shape in Australia. The day after Smethurst’s home was raided, the ABC’s Sydney headquarters were raided over a series of 2017 stories about the conduct of some of the nation’s special forces in Afghanistan.AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw made it clear on Wednesday afternoon that the force has still not ruled out pursuing charges against Smethurst and the ABC journalists. The commissioner also announced an internal review of the investigations into the journalists. He did not move to return the material obtained in the raid. As Merritt writes on Thursday, even common thieves, when sprung, are required to give back their ill-gotten gains. “The AFP, it seems, are now to be treated as legally privileged burglars free to pillage and keep the property of others.’’	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Kelly does no favours to electorate that backed him	The Australian	The government must kick on strongly despite its precarious position Governing while relying on the support of a stroppy media tart sitting as an independent would be a challenge for any political leader. Craig Kelly’s resignation from the Liberal Party has cost the Morrison government its working majority in the House of Representatives. It potentially could create problems for the government for the remainder of this term. Mr Kelly, however, has promised to support supply and confidence bills and “seek to vote in a manner consistent with all official policies that the Coalition took to the 2019 election”. But all bets will be off, presumably, on legislation unforeseen two years ago. Mr Kelly could resist any new developments on climate change policy, for example, such as legislating a target for net-zero emissions by 2050. Cases such as that would put the ball in the opposition’s court.
Given his determination to be re-elected in Hughes, his Sutherland Shire seat that borders Scott Morrison in Cook, Mr Kelly also could be expected to favour populist, egocentric positions if difficult decisions needed to be made on cutting spending. He holds Hughes with a margin of 18,800 but it remains to be seen how safe he will be next time without brand Liberal behind him. Joining the Nationals or One Nation would be unlikely to help his chances of retaining the seat. Mr Kelly’s defection suggests he believed he had a better shot running as an independent than securing Liberal Party preselection. After the Prime Minister rebuked Mr Kelly three weeks ago for his outspoken comments about corona­virus treatments, government sources said it was increasingly unlikely that Mr Morrison would intervene to back Mr Kelly in any preselection battle in ­Hughes, as he did in 2018. In resigning, Mr Kelly has shown scant regard for the people who voted him into parliament and for those who saved his preselection.
The longer-term consequences of Mr Kelly’s resignation remain to be seen. As Greg Sheridan wrote on Wednesday, centre-right politics has collapsed or fractured in many nations. This is evident in Europe, especially in France, and in the US, where the Republican Party is under stress between Donald Trump’s populism on one hand and a more traditional centre-right tradition of governance on the other. The coherence and unity of the Liberal-Nationals Coalition have been strengths for national centre-right politics in Australia for decades. But mavericks such as Don Chipp, Bob Katter, Pauline Hanson, Tony Windsor, Rob Oakeshott and Cory Bernardi have defected previously. Some caused ripples, others unleashed storms. But Mr Kelly’s move seems to be mainly about him.
Mr Kelly’s defection may increase the chances of an election this year. At this stage the government looks set to travel well without him, but he could be an unwelcome distraction. But well-managed minority government can be a springboard to majority government, as was the case for Peter Beattie in Queensland and Steve Bracks in Victoria. Mr Beattie’s bold strategy after he was elected with 44 seats out of 89 in 1998 was the right one. He said he would govern as though he had a working majority of 10. He succeeded. Similarly, after forming minority government in 1999, Mr Bracks was returned in a landslide in 2002. In a difficult week for the government, Mr Morrison’s leadership authority was evident when Anthony Albanese tried to goad him about Mr Kelly. “If the Leader of the Opposition is feeling so confident about the performance of his opposition, perhaps he would like to bring on a motion,” Mr Morrison said in reply to the first question on Tuesday. Mr Albanese also got short shrift from Mr Morrison on Wednesday: “If he thinks he has control of this house, I invite him to move the relevant motion or stop showing off.”	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Cut green lawfare to lift growth, jobs, investment	The Australian	The government must not waste the chance for vital reform
The news that a small coterie of green activists has used environmental laws to delay 28 projects worth $65bn ­ demands effective action by the Morrison government. The investments include mines, dams, roads, a tourist development, a natural gas project, a salmon farm and landclearing. On Friday and Saturday, political editor Dennis Shanahan revealed companies trying to invest billions of dollars have been forced into court for a total of more than 10,000 days (almost 28 years) since 2000. At a time when business investment has dropped to its lowest level since the 1990s and Australia is in danger of a recession as a result of the coronavirus, green lawfare is undermining GDP and jobs, especially in regional Australia.
The current review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 led by former Australian Competition & Consumer Commission chairman Graeme Samuel should be an important catalyst for reform. Environment Minister Sussan Ley launched it last year to tackle green tape and provide greater certainty to business, farmers and conservation groups. Investors and regional leaders, frustrated by green groups tying up projects in litigation, should not miss the chance to speak up. Submissions are due by April 17. Mr Samuel will present a draft report in June and his final report in October.
The review covers the EPBC Act as a whole. But last week, free-market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs showed that section 487 of that act is especially problematic. It is used by activists, thousands of kilometres from projects, to delay them for as long as possible. The Abbott government passed an amendment to repeal section 487 in the lower house in 2015. But the Senate blocked the reform. The Morrison government, committed to cutting red tape to boost growth, should revisit the issue. ­Resources Minister Keith Pitt is eager for reform, noting people in regional areas are sick of seeing significant projects delayed by court action by activists with no ­connection to their area. Senate crossbenchers such as Centre Alliance and One Nation should be persuaded, in the interests of their supporters. Submissions to the Samuel inquiry would be a useful impetus for reform.
As Shanahan reported, the IPA found that the vast majority of lawfare under section 487 inflicted long delays but did not result in substantial changes in environmental controls. Of cases under section 487 since 2016, 94 per cent have failed to bring about a ­substantial change to original projects as ­approved by the federal environment minister. Groups that have used the section include the Australian Conservation Foundation, Friends of Leadbeaters Possum, the Bob Brown Foundation and the Wilderness Society. The Adani coal project in Queensland’s Galilee Basin finally got the green light from the state following Labor’s abysmal showing in last year’s federal election. But the company’s nine-year battle, including 341 days in court courtesy of an Australian Conservation Foundation appeal in 2016, damaged Australia’s sovereign risk profile among overseas investors.Repealing section 487 would not diminish the legal options open to private landowners and others with direct interests in projects that could adversely affect their interests. But by barring ideologically driven green lawfare by activists, such reform would provide an enduring economic stimulus, especially in the regions where unemployment is a problem.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Climate roadmap for our pragmatic Prime Minister	The Australian	The government must resist any attempt to pick winners
Technology and innovation have always been the best answer to meeting the challenge of lifting global economic prosperity while safeguarding the biodiversity of a shared planet. Australia’s first response to the emergence of climate change as a major issue was to join with the US and other developed nations to invest in research and development of solutions. Another consistent theme has been for Australia to measure its progress against that of the rest of the world. These sentiments were articulated by prime ministers Paul Keating and John Howard before climate change action fell hostage to political division and claimed a string of leaders: Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull.
There is plenty of politics still left in the climate debate, but in recent days Scott Morrison has begun to lay out a pragmatic route he no doubt hopes will lead his government all the way to victory at the next election. The Labor opposition is attempting to change tack but is still offering a mixed message, stranded between the demands of its traditional blue-collar base and those of voters in its inner-city seats. On the green fringe, there will always be those who see every bushfire as evidence of a climate emergency, just as MPs from coal-producing regions rightly will continue to argue forcefully for an industry that creates jobs and a big portion of the nation’s export earnings.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a new dimension to the conversation on energy, employment and sustainability. The technology roadmap being outlined on Tuesday is an opportunity to build on the Morrison government’s focus on “things that work” and that can be done. Announcing the development of the technology roadmap, federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said the goal was to bring a strategic and system-wide view to future investments in low-emissions technologies. With a slogan of “technology, not taxes”, Mr Taylor said it was an approach based on rigour, discipline and optimism, not ideology. Part of the discipline was in being prepared to drop schemes that lost promise and to leave deployment of technologies that had reached commercial viability to the private sector.
Stretch goals in the roadmap include getting hydrogen production to less than $2 a kilogram and commercialisation of carbon capture and storage to enable low-emissions heavy industry and prolong the use of fossil fuels. Biological sequestration in soil carbon and elsewhere represents a massive untapped potential new industry for Australian farmers while firmed renewables and long-duration energy storage are the much-needed technologies to sustain the existing rush to deploy solar and wind.
The roadmap is certain to face objections from special interests that favour one technology over another. The government must resist any attempt to pick winners, just as it should avoid making politics the central issue of its climate change response. The pandemic provides an opportunity for all sides to come closer together. The reality is that every state government now has a policy of zero emissions by 2050. The Prime Minister says Australia almost certainly will be emissions neutral by 2050 but the official target remains the Paris Agreement pledge to cut emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change target date to become carbon neutral remains the second half of the 21st century.
On present indications it is business that increasingly will take the lead, with public and investor pressure forcing directors to put much greater emphasis on sustainability goals. Business, in turn, is united about the need for greater policy clarity from government. Mindful of the heavy political blood already spilled on the altar of climate change policy, there is an opportunity for a pragmatic, right-leaning prime minister such as Mr Morrison to cut through. Setting a framework, as the government has sought to do in recent days, is important. Policies should encourage R&D of new technologies without offering ongoing and unsustainable subsidies. Solutions that work will speak for themselves in the marketplace. The disastrous rollout of the National Broadband Network is a clear example of how locking into old technologies through government mandate comes with a heavy price tag for taxpayers and consumers. The Australian has always identified investment in R&D as critical to success in reducing global carbon dioxide emissions while preserving living standards and safeguarding nature, just as we have supported mechanisms that put a market price on carbon in a way that rewards innovation. Our other benchmarks have been to limit subsidies, to call out rent seekers and to resist the urge by government to pick winners. We are in favour of renewables, just as we believe there can be a global future for coal done well with carbon capture and storage, and we support the use of gas with infrastructure that one day may be used by a thriving hydrogen industry. We want battery technology to continue to develop and we want a government flexible enough to adopt new advances as they appear that will provide the best outcome for the economy, the environment and the nation.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Timely defence escalation to meet strategic dangers	The Australian	The government’s assessment of the situation is realistic On Wednesday Scott Morrison issued a clarion call to the nation. We have arrived at a pivotal moment in history. The Prime Minister’s speech at the Australian Defence Force Academy marks a seismic shift in how the government views our security and the stability of our immediate region, and the stability of the wider global order. Since European settlement in 1788 the security of this continent has depended on the maritime supremacy of two great liberal democracies — Britain and the US. Throughout our history as a sovereign nation, our security, and on one occasion our national survival, depended on the global order provided by those two allies, whose values we share and whose institutions have shaped our own culture and polity. Australia is a trading nation and the security of our sea lanes has been guaranteed in turn by the hegemony of Britain, then the US. While we paid an enormous price in the two great global conflagrations of the 20th century, we enjoyed considerable prosperity without being required to divert large portions of our gross domestic product to national security. Rather than making us a lucky country, that indulgence, arguably, made us a fools’ paradise. Only in the earliest and darkest days of the Pacific War was an enemy state able to strike directly at our homeland. In the intervening decades we became complacent about the state of the world. Our geography is that of an island continent. Our strategic culture has conformed to that insularity. For too long we assumed that the US would continue to preside over our region and the global order. China would rise to the status of a great power and inevitably would democratise as it became enmeshed in the global market economy. Russia would be weakened and acquiescent in its status as a vanquished superpower.
These rosy assumptions have not been vindicated. At the height of that benign period no less a leader than John Howard asserted that Australia need not choose between its Anglo-American history and its Asian geography. On Wednesday, Mr Morrison effectively declared that benign era has come to an end. History has not ended. Indeed, if history is any guide, we are entering a period of grave danger. The last time the global system accommodated two totalitarian capitalist states, German and Japan, was during the 1930s. World War II ensued. It is not alarmist to observe, as did this newspaper’s Greg Sheridan and Jim Molan, a distinguished former soldier, that the strategic outlook in our immediate region is dire. There is a very real risk of great power conflict in the Indo-Pacific. It is not fanciful to suggest that any one of a number of flashpoints could erupt into conventional war.
Nor is there any polite way of ignoring the common denominator in all these potential conflicts. China now constitutes a grave risk to the peace and stability of our region. Under Xi Jinping, China has become belligerent and provocative. It seems to have viewed the recent tumult in the West as a symptom of terminal decay. Thus emboldened, it has intensified its repression of civil liberty in Hong Kong and made ominous hints about its claims to Taiwan. In recent weeks it has also acted provocatively towards Japan and Vietnam. It has engaged in bloody clashes along the disputed Line of Actual Control with India. This intensification of its reprehensible behaviour towards its neighbours follows the steady militarisation of natural and artificial reefs in the South China Sea during the past few years. The West was far too complacent about this activity, which has now created a new ground reality designed to ensure forward basing of US naval and air forces inside the so-called second island chain became untenable. In relentlessly pursuing this course, China has treated international law with contempt. Its territorial claims, defined by its preposterous Nine Dash Line, has created growing consternation in Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and The Philippines. But of more immediate concern has been its overt hostility towards, and bullying of, Australia through hysterical accusations of racism and sinister cyber operations against our infrastructure and attempts to subvert our democratic institutions. Finally, Mr Morrison has declared that a bright line must be drawn between civility and appeasement. To the brutal regime in Beijing, the price of peace is supine compliance. The choice between our history and geography has been made for us — by the regime in Beijing.
This newspaper argued last November that Australia needed to bolster its forward defences in northern Australia, and to procure armed drones and land-based ballistic missiles. We welcome the comprehensive and urgent suite of measures announced by Mr Morrison. Together, they enhance our capability to deny intrusions upon the vital sea and air approaches to our nation. They are defensive in nature and will be employed only in the event of direct threat.
However, they also permit us to support our allies, especially the US and India, in maintaining freedom of passage through vital sea lanes through enhancements to our mine warfare capabilities. This measure and our procurement of anti-ballistic missiles are long overdue. Apologists for the Chinese Communist Party will blame Australia for the rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. Some will resort to the hoary chestnut of white Australian racism. That is nonsense. Australia is one of numerous Asian nations summoning the resolve to resist China’s revisionist ambitions.
The ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic have already restored the primacy of the nation-state as the source of security and allegiance. Hard borders and more realistic Westphalian alliances will replace fluid borders and the footloose cosmopolitanism of the post-Cold War era. Davos Man has succumbed to the virus. Mr Morrison is correct in moving urgently to ensure that Australia has the means to secure its sovereignty and liberal democratic values as we enter what some are terming a new cold war. By showing resolve and acquiring the means to deter threats, we ensure that it remains a cold war.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
The grand old dame starring on this week’s cover is a fine e [... ] [Derived headline ]	The New Zealand Herald	The grand old dame starring on this week’s cover is a fine example of the 1920s-era California-style bungalows that sprung up in Auckland’s inner-city when the property developers of the time were busy transforming farmland into what these days is some of the most desirable real estate in the city.
The property was at one time split into flats, before a previous owner put in the hard yards to make it a single home again, managing to retain many of the character features of the era such as original mouldings and matai floors.
The current owners have had to do little in the way of structural renovations, though they have updated the home to fit with the modern lifestyle of today. Adopting a classic but contemporary style is one way to retain your home’s character while giving it a modern twist.

Russia’s aggressive cyber warfare	The Australian	The hacking of government agencies is a threat to the US and its allies US political leaders are right to be alarmed by the startling disclosure that for nine months an extended, undetected Russian cyber attack penetrated the heart of government in Washington. The National Nuclear Security Administration in the Energy Department that oversees the US nuclear stockpile, the Pentagon, Homeland Security and Treasury were affected. Democratic congressman Jason Crow, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said the infiltration was “unprecedented in scale and scope” and “our modern-day cyber Pearl Harbor”. Dick Durbin, the second-most senior Democrat in the Senate, said the attack was “virtually a declaration of war”. Republican senator Mitt Romney said it was “the equivalent of Russian bombers flying undetected over the entire country” since March.
US intelligence agencies and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former CIA director, are emphatic that the hack was carried out by the Russian SVR agency, a successor to the KGB. “Clearly” Russia was responsible, Mr Pompeo said on Friday, describing the hack as “very significant”. Republican senator Marco Rubio, head of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a Trump backer, is calling for retribution, arguing “the methods of the hack were consistent with Russian cyber operations”. After days of uncustomary Twitter silence on a major issue involving national security, Donald Trump played down Russian involvement. Without any intelligence agency backing, he raised the prospect “it may be China”.
Despite an official US federal government warning about the “grave risk” posed by the hack, Mr Trump’s longstanding (and perplexing) aversion to calling out Vladimir Putin’s malign activities came to the fore. In again seeking to avoid any criticism of the Kremlin, Mr Trump reverted to his preoccupation with his election loss, claiming the real motive of the cyber onslaught included “a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big”. For four years, Mr Trump has had good reason to be constantly vigilant about Chinese bad behaviour. But in this instance, the weight of intelligence and Mr Pompeo’s conclusion point overwhelmingly to protracted and malign Russian involvement. It would be unfortunate for the US and its allies if Mr Trump failed to accept reality when his own Republican congress members are demanding a resolute response to Moscow’s cyber offensive. The scale and extent staggered even experienced cyber analysts. It saw the Russian SVR agency infiltrating both government and private networks through a company called Solar Winds that makes critical network monitoring software used by governments and blue-chip global firms. The hack also hit computer networks in US allies Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, Britain, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.
US reports suggest officials are embarrassingly unclear on the details of the breach and how it was able to operate undetected for so long. What is certain is that a strong response is needed to leave Mr Putin in no doubt his malicious cyber warfare will not be tolerated. The Russian despot’s unrelenting attempts to subvert and undermine Western democracies are intolerable. They need to be confronted. Scott Morrison has warned previously of a “pattern of malicious cyber activity” by Russia’s military intelligence. “Cyberspace is not the Wild West,’’ he said in October 2018. “The international community, including Russia, has agreed that international law and norms of responsible state behaviour apply in cyberspace. By embarking on a pattern of malicious cyber behaviour, Russia has shown a total disregard for the agreements it helped to negotiate.” Mr Trump’s insouciance over the Russian cyber onslaught ill-serves his legacy. Ex-Trump national security adviser John Bolton was right to call for “appropriate retaliation to re-establish deterrence”. President-elect Joe Biden has declared cyber security will be “a top priority”, and pledged “I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation”. Mr Putin’s attack demands no less.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Victorians’ mental health suffering under lockdowns	The Australian	The hotel quarantine inquiry is producing important lessons Victorians have had enough. Their state is in the grip of a mental health crisis, which is not news to those who have endured months of one of the strictest coronavirus lockdowns in the world. Month after month the restrictions, curfew, loneliness and anxiety about health, jobs, businesses destroyed, holding on to homes and children’s wellbeing and education have taken a heavy toll. This will not be a surprise to many Victorians’ families and friends interstate and overseas who have seen the impact of the heavy-handed response on loved ones.
Some of the scale of that impact has now been quantified. Calls to the support lines of Beyond Blue are 77 per cent higher in Victoria than across the rest of the country. Calls to Kids Helpline and Lifeline also have soared. Eating disorders among young people are up by a third. Since March there has been a 15 per cent increase in the number of Medicare-subsidised mental health services delivered, as Simon Benson reports on Wednesday. In a state of 6.5 million people, $819m in benefits has been paid for 7.4 million services. Between September and October alone, more than 350,000 Victorians sought access to Medicare-funded GPs, psychiatrists, psychologists and counselling treatments. It will be cold comfort to Victorians that the World Health Organisation now is urging governments not to use lockdowns as their primary method of controlling the spread of COVID-19. The WHO says strict restrictions have had a dramatic adverse effect on lives, especially in exacerbating poverty.
The virus has not gone away. Victoria recorded 15 new cases on Monday and 12 cases on Tuesday, one fewer than NSW, which had 13 but without the restrictions that have crippled Victoria. Premier Daniel Andrews, to some extent, is at last acknowledging that it may be necessary to reopen the economy with higher daily case numbers than originally planned: “It may be at a point where we have to call it, where we have to say that this is as good as it will get — that means there is some greater risk, that means that the task of keeping this thing suppressed will be harder,” he said on Monday. Health authorities have said the 14-day average had to be about five cases for the government to consider easing restrictions significantly on Sunday. But, as Mr Andrews said on Tuesday, 10 might have to be the new five, and five the new zero. The 5km radius rule should be dropped. So should rules prohibiting business activity, including keeping the doors of most retail stores, restaurants, cafes and pubs shut. As in other states, COVID-safe plans would need to be put in place and supervised. But Mr Andrews has been sending mixed signals, adding to confusion and frustration. If Melbourne opened up now, he said on Tuesday, the city would be open for only a short period before rising cases would shut it down again. “That is not the strategy,” he said. “That’s not what people want. It’s not what I’m prepared to settle for.” Despite Mr Andrews’ purported determination to protect public health, revelations continue to emerge from the hotel quarantine inquiry exposing gross failures of governance. Health officers critical to the oversight of the ill-fated hotel quarantine scheme received just one hour of online training, as Ewin Hannan reports on Wednesday. In a final submission to the inquiry, Wilson Security said it was not until June 22 — three months into the scheme, and after the Rydges and Stamford hotel outbreaks — that Department of Health and Human Services staff met the company to discuss Wilson’s infection control and prevention arrangements at the hotels. Until that time, the DHHS had no idea that Wilson had established infection screening procedures such as temperature testing. The DHHS then told Wilson of its intention to introduce similar procedures across the program and asked for details. There were no outbreaks at hotels where Wilson Security operated. But under minimal or non-existent DHHS supervision, outbreaks at hotels overseen by other companies led to Victoria’s second wave of the virus, which has cost almost 800 lives and devastated the state and national economies. If, as Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton says, the state’s remaining chains of transmission are some of the trickiest in the world, DHHS staff will need to be far more efficient in avoiding a third wave of infection than they were in overseeing hotel quarantining. Professor Sutton says although NSW recorded more virus cases than Victoria on Tuesday, the circumstances were very different. He should take the long-suffering public into his confidence and explain. Why is controlling the virus so much harder in Melbourne than in Sydney? Despite Mr Andrews’ daily press briefings, Victorians feel alienated from decision-making. As federal Health Minister Greg Hunt says, the mental health impact of prolonged lockdowns is severe. Victorians need to see a light at the end of the tunnel and an effective plan of testing, tracking and isolation in the event of small outbreaks that will allow the state to function while living with COVID-19. That light remains elusive.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
EDITORIAL Back to school a sensible way to begin slowly	The Northern Advocate	The immediate area of the Government’s focus as it responds to the Covid-19 pandemic in past weeks has, of course, been health.
Now that we appear to be tracking on the right path in that area, the focus turns to the economy as the Government looks to open up New Zealand to business. In turn, this leads to education, to enable workers’ children to return to the classroom and begin the equally important business of learning again.
This week, as we exit alert level 4 and our month-long lockdown, there is a notable feeling of anticipation, certainly. Yet it is clear for parents, caregivers and education providers gearing up to open the school gates, there is also much anxiety in the mix, too.
This is understandable. For the past month we have made major and fundamental changes to the way in which we live, work, study and interact in an effort to combat the spread of the virus here. The messaging has been — and continues to be in large part — act as if you have Covid-19 and everyone else does, too.
It is a huge turnaround to start relaxing that thinking.
Parents are rightly anxious about sending their precious offspring back out into a world that many of us adults are still not venturing fully into. Schools and early childhood centres are rightly worried about being able to ensure the health and safety of their young charges and staff alike.
The Government has been working on ways to mitigate the physical health risks, and balance them against the flipsides: the potential psychological risks of keeping children in lockdown too long, the long-term impact on children’s learning and progress, and the need for parents to get back to work.
Children have not been immune to the virus and there have been child deaths. Yet Education Minister Chris Hipkins and director general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield say the international experience so far is the health risk to youngsters is generally low and the impact on those infected generally far less severe than on adults. In New Zealand’s case, the rate of community transmission of the virus is now very low, and that gives reassurance it is safe for limited numbers of children to return to education facilities with precautionary measures in place.
Not all epidemiologists and academics agree, saying more evidence is required. One worry is the extent to which children can convey the virus to adults, particularly the elderly, who are the most likely to get very sick and die from the virus. That will be something people looking to expand their family bubbles in alert level 3 should take into consideration.
The Early Childhood Council wants centres to stay closed until alert level 2. At Morrinsville College (Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s old school), principal John Inger has accused the Government of forcing teachers to be child-minders and warning of the “potential disaster” of schools becoming “incubators for the virus”. But the Auckland Primary Principals’ Association says all its schools will be opening and it believes the national sentiment is largely to do the same.
We have to start somewhere. A partial opening, up to year 10 inclusive and largely for the children of essential workers and others who must return to work, is a sensible way to begin.
While the Government clearly desires teachers back in classrooms, Hipkins says he will not “force” early childhood centres to open under alert level 3. That flexibility is welcome.
Children pick up on the stress and anxiety of adults around them. If a facility is not ready to welcome kids back, and not comfortable doing so, it is perhaps better for all involved that it doesn’t open. But many are willing and able to do so.
All parents must now play their part. The Government recognises there will be some who need to take advantage of the partial education opening. But the messaging is that parents who can keep their kids learning at home should do so. An expanded bubble with a caregiver may help with that. Those parents who do send their kids back into education facilities must ensure sick children stay at home, and that family bubbles are strictly maintained outside the classroom, as are good hygiene practices.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life

Protests make a mockery of COVID-19 lockdowns	The Australian	The impact of the marches will emerge in the next fortnight
Viewers of television news on Saturday could only stare in indignation, wondering if they had missed an official announcement that the COVID-19 pandemic and all restrictions were over. As police looked on, tens of thousands of protesters jammed city streets, squares and bridges, ignoring social distancing and rules limiting gatherings to 50 or 20 people. Workers who have lost jobs, nursing home residents missing their families, small business owners who have watched enterprises shrivel after years of hard work, hospital patients going without visitors, students whose study and sporting hopes have been upended and those prohibited from travelling to or from states such as Queensland can only wonder: Why one rule for the protesters and another for the rest of us? Many people now regard the remaining lockdown rules as a farce and want to disregard them. That could be risky. But the protests, and the collective failure of the states to prevent and control them, let Australians down.
One way or another, the protests will be a turning point in Australia’s fight against coronavirus. On one hand, if the gatherings trigger a spike in cases, as the nation’s health officers fear, further opening of the economy and the lifting of state border restrictions might be delayed. If so, consequences for workers, the unemployed, struggling businesses, government revenue and the ability of taxpayers to continue supporting those in need would be dire. The Parliamentary Budget Office has projected the legacy of the virus will be additional net debt of up to $620bn by the end of the decade. The budget deficit is expected to peak at up to $200bn next financial year and remain in the red until 2030.
On the other hand, if no significant spikes in cases emerge in the next fortnight, many will regard the case for an immediate lift of all remaining restrictions as compelling. Regardless of the dangers — evident in rising infection totals overseas — demands will come thick and fast for a return to full crowds, with or without masks, at major sporting events, conferences, in cinemas and theatres, at churches, weddings, funerals, baptisms, parties and in restaurants, clubs and bars. It may help the cause of public health that most, but by no means all, of those who protested were young; although young people can spread the virus to those who are more vulnerable. It is doubtful whether many of those who attended understand the impact of a severe recession, which their actions might have exacerbated. The poor and disadvantaged, including indigenous people, would suffer severe hardships, with governments’ capacity to help limited after months of costly support and stimulus spending.
The democratic right to protest is important. And as we have long argued, policymakers, in consultation with indigenous leaders, must improve the administration of justice and reduce indigenous prison rates, which exceed those of African-Americans in the US. The deaths of at least 432 Aborigines in custody since the 1991 royal commission is a national shame. The need to address such imperatives, however, does not justify untimely, reckless protests, just as the nation is edging close to eradicating COVID-19.
After weeks of nannying, the shillyshallying of state premiers towards the protests beggared belief. On Sunday, WA Premier Mark McGowan insisted state borders would remain closed “for a considerable period’’ amid fears the protests could spread the virus. Yet he has not banned a Black Lives Matter rally planned for his state next Saturday, but urged protesters to maintain physical distancing. Experience in the eastern states, and the US, shows such pleas are readily forgotten as crowds build in the emotion of such events. In a pertinent warning, WA indigenous state Treasurer Ben Wyatt pointed out that indigenous people faced elevated risks from coronavirus.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian did the right thing on Friday when she declared the Sydney march illegal. And on Friday night, a NSW Supreme Court judge ruled in favour of an application by NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller to block the Sydney CBD protest. The will of the elected government was thwarted on Saturday, however, by the NSW Court of Appeal. Fifteen minutes before the Sydney march was due to start, it authorised the event. That display of judicial activism did not uphold the public interest. Barely two months ago, NSW police were driving off road in Rushcutters Park in Sydney’s inner east to move on a few people sitting on the grass. On Saturday, they stood by as thousands massed in close contact. The inconsistencies are farcical.
In Victoria, where Premier Daniel Andrews declared in April that “playing golf is not worth someone’s life” and year 3-10 students only return to school this week, police let protesters off scot-free and fined organisers. Queensland and South Australian protesters also got off lightly. Supposedly too nervous to let “southerners’’ in to holiday, as local tourism operators go broke, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk failed to stop 30,000 turning out in Brisbane. The lack of firm instructions to police from state leaders, insisting on crowd control and safe spacing, or, better still, blocking the protests, was problematic. Now the reckoning starts. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee meets on Monday to consider the dangers of new COVID-19 outbreaks and possible delays in easing social restrictions after the rallies. Australians have been patient, good-hearted and disciplined during the COVID-19 crisis. The protests made a mockery of their sterling efforts.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Workplace reform, open borders will boost tourism	The Australian	The industry has made its case for extra help. But it must be limited Despite the strength of the post-COVID economic recovery, Australia’s tourism industry is still facing big challenges. From Broome to Tasmania, Cape York to Victoria, a third of the nation has suffered a drop in visitor numbers of 40 per cent or more. The devastation wrought by border closures and the halt to international visitors is not confined to a couple of hotspots in Queensland, Rosie Lewis reports on Monday. While a third of towns and cities have seen some positive growth, this is due mainly to domestic day visitors, who spend far less than overnight travellers and international tourists.
As tourism businesses prepare for the end of JobKeeper on March 28, Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director Simon Westaway is predicting mass redundancies. Tourism Minister Dan Tehan is urging Australians to do their “patriotic duty” and take a holiday at home this year to help the struggling sector. And Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has resorted to giving Queenslanders 15,000 travel vouchers, worth up to $200 apiece, to visit Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef. She wants Josh Frydenberg to extend the JobKeeper subsidy for the tourism sector. The Treasurer, who is in Queensland, could outline the government’s economic support plans as early as Friday. Well targeted assistance funded by taxpayers, however, can be no more than a stop gap. As Mr Frydenberg says, more than 70 per cent of those who were on JobKeeper in the Wide Bay, Townsville, Mackay and Whitsunday regions have come off it. So have more than 65 per cent of those on JobKeeper on the Sunshine Coast and 55 per cent in Cairns.
The return of the industry to full strength will depend on several factors. First will be the success of the vaccination program in Australia and in our overseas tourist markets, which will allow international borders to be lifted when it is safe to do so. Second, if state leaders want to protect the industry and jobs in the meantime, it is vital they avoid further lockdowns and state border closures. The inconvenience, fear of being stranded away from home and anxiety about having to quarantine at heavy personal expense have thrown a dampener on many domestic holiday plans. State border closures, or merely the threat of them, have left confidence among potential travellers at an all-time low, according to Tourism and Transport Forum chief executive Margy Osmond. “That is why, as the vaccine is rolled out, TTF calls on national cabinet to commit to put politics and state electioneering aside and commit to keeping state borders open once and for all.” Third and most important in the long run, the Morrison government’s industrial relations reforms are vital for recovery, efficiency in the sector and job security. In the interests of workers and businesses, Senate crossbenchers should not take advantage of the absence of Attorney-General and Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter to force a delay in the legislation. As Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry industrial relations director Scott Barklamb says, with JobKeeper ending soon small businesses still struggling with restrictions and reduced trade cannot be the collateral damage of politicians’ attention being focused elsewhere. Tourism enterprises and their staff need flexibility to meet the demands of a 24/7 industry with boom periods and quieter seasons. Crossbenchers should work with acting Industrial Relations Minister Michaelia Cash and pass the omnibus bill in the national interest.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Restoring economy key to healing civil unrest in US	The Australian	The killing of George Floyd has become a lightning rod The best, and the worst, sides of the US were writ large at the weekend. As a display of scientific ingenuity and private enterprise, it would be hard to beat the SpaceX launch from the Kennedy Space Centre on Saturday. After watching the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule built not by NASA but by South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk’s SpaceX company, Donald Trump spoke of “the sense of pride and unity that (this) brings’’. SpaceX marks the first human space launch from the US in almost a decade, a partnership between a private entrepreneur and government aimed at revitalising the nation’s space ambitions. The President hoped the launch would be a “partial antidote” to the impact of COVID-19 that has claimed 106,000 American lives and left 40 million unemployed, as well as to the violence convulsing 30 US cities.
The trigger for the violent disorder, the killing of unarmed African-American George Floyd, 46, by a white police officer in Minneapolis last week, has ignited a tinderbox of grievances. Video footage showed that for eight minutes and 46 seconds Derek Chauvin, 44, pinned Mr Floyd to the ground with his knee pressed into his neck. Mr Floyd’s repeated gasps — “I can’t breathe” — were ignored. It was, as Mr Trump, who was initially sympathetic to the public anger, said “a shocking sight’’. Even when Mr Floyd became “unresponsive”, Mr Chauvin kept his knee pressed to Mr Floyd’s neck for almost another three minutes.
Mr Chauvin has now been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. He faces decades in jail if convicted. Three other officers who did nothing to stop Mr Chauvin have been suspended and are under investigation.
The riots, as Cameron Stewart writes from Washington, are morphing into something broader than Mr Floyd’s death, police brutality and racism. They have become a catch-all for the grievances of many in a nation stricken by the pandemic and deeply divided by politics, race and wealth.
Even the White House was locked down as protesters converged. They were incensed by Mr Trump’s provocative tweet condemning “THUGS … dishonouring the memory of George Floyd’’ and warning “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”. That phrase echoed a notoriously harsh police chief during unrest in Florida in 1967. Mr Trump argued he was merely stating the obvious, as a warning to those looting shops. Atlanta’s black mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, spoke in a voice of reason to rioters in her city: “This is not a protest, this is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. This is chaos … if you care about this city, then go home. If you want to change America, go and register to vote. Do it in November. That is the change we need in this country.” Five months from the November 3 presidential election, Mr Trump is intent on reopening the US economy and allaying the impact of the lockdown on jobs. But the battle against the virus remains challenging, with hundreds of new cases being reported daily, adding to the 1.8 million Americans who have been diagnosed so far. Mr Trump’s prospects of re-election will depend largely on his ability, in the coming months, to reverse the debilitating effect of COVID-19 on the economy, especially jobs.
Against critics’ expectations, he showed what he was capable of after his election in 2016. True to his manifesto, his corporate tax cuts and pro-investment policies revitalised much of the nation’s rust-bucket manufacturing sector, to the benefit of employers and workers’ salaries. In January, before COVID-19 hit, unemployment in the US was 3.6 per cent, its lowest rate since 1969. And unemployment among African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans was lower than at any time since the US Labor Department began collecting those statistics. Analysts expect the next set of unemployment figures to reach almost 20 per cent. Rebuilding the nation’s economic base, which Mr Trump is well qualified to do, can only help repair its civil unrest and despair. It will require as intrepid an effort, of a different kind, as the launching of SpaceX.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Victorian spike hits economy	The Australian	The lockdown of nine public housing towers could backfire In managing COVID-19, good health policy that keeps the virus suppressed is also good economic policy. That correlation is writ large in “Fast crisis, slow recovery”, the Deloitte Access Economics Business Outlook analysis released on Monday. Coronavirus has taken a sledgehammer to the nation’s economy. But, while no state or territory has been left unscathed, some have been hit harder than others. After a bleak weekend in Victoria, where 108 new cases were recorded on Saturday and 74 on Sunday, the need for tighter restrictions, Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson noted in the report, “has sent job losses soaring and consumers hanging on to their cash rather than spending it’’. Victoria is set to take the unwanted title of Australia’s worst economic state through the COVID crisis, as Geoff Chambers reports on Monday. Population, once a key growth engine in the nation’s second-largest economy, has stalled. Victoria is also heavily dependent on overseas students, whose return will be delayed by the latest outbreaks.
After a spike of 312 cases over the past week in Melbourne, Premier Daniel Andrews’s move to lock down nine public housing towers in the inner suburbs of Flemington and North Melbourne, where 27 people have tested positive to the virus, smacks of desperation. The 3000 residents, confined to their small units for five days, overseen by 500 police, in buildings with high population densities, are angry and confused about the dystopian experiment, especially when 43 per cent of those diagnosed with COVID-19 across Melbourne are in local government areas with no postcodes locked down — yet. Nor has the process been smooth. On Sunday afternoon, 18 hours after it began, residents such as a father of five young children complained the family had not been doorknocked and were worried about what they were going to eat. Food and care packages are being distributed, but some residents feel as though they are in jail. That said, experience overseas shows the virus spreads rapidly in high-density, low socio-economic housing with poor facilities, where residents are less likely to have access to the best medical care. Federal authorities are supporting Victoria’s action, with acting Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly likening the towers to “vertical cruise ships”.
Apart from Wuhan early on, few other places in the world have forced such a drastic denial of liberties. Time will determine its effectiveness. It is a gamble. Apart from the impact on the mental health of those confined with no access to fresh air and sunshine, lockdowns can make a bad situation worse. Scientists believe the enforced cabin quarantine on the Diamond Princess off Japan in February was such a case. Despite the lockdown, 712 of 3711 passengers (19 per cent) got the virus. The impact of COVID-19 and the measures taken to limit what authorities call its “explosive’’ potential to spread through the public housing towers underline the fact that bad mistakes in managing the virus must be avoided. Victorians are paying dearly for the Andrews government’s failures. These include: not ensuring proper supervision of quarantine hotels; lack of serious effort to stop Black Lives Matter marches, which sent a dangerous signal to the rest of the community; and its failure to communicate the need for social distancing and testing to all ethnic and religious minorities.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Tower residents’ rights trampled	The Australian	The lockdown was warranted but imposed in a harsh, inhumane way Victoria, under Premier Daniel Andrews, purports to take inclusiveness so seriously that its public service has been directed to phase out “gendered” terms such as husband and wife as well as Mr, Mrs, Miss and Ms. Supposed concern for human rights, however, was cast aside when the Andrews government detained 3000 residents of nine public housing towers in the inner Melbourne suburbs of Flemington and North Melbourne in early July, shortly before the state’s second wave of coronavirus. Mr Andrews gave residents no advance warning before he announced the lockdown on Saturday afternoon, July 4. Confused residents, many of whom did not speak English, were caught off guard without food, medications and other essentials. They were confined to their small units and denied fresh air, sunshine and exercise for days.
Victorian Ombudsman Deborah Glass has called on the government to apologise to them — for good reason. In a report tabled in parliament on Thursday, Ms Glass said: “The rushed lockdown was not compatible with the residents’ human rights, including their right to humane treatment when deprived of liberty. In my opinion, based on the evidence gathered by the investigation, the action appeared to be contrary to the law.” As we editorialised on Monday, July 6: “Apart from Wuhan early on, few other places in the world have forced such a drastic denial of liberties … On Sunday afternoon, 18 hours after it began, residents such as a father of five young children complained the family had not been doorknocked and were worried about what they were going to eat.” Giving residents even half a day to shop and explaining in their own languages what was happening would have made a real difference. Time would determine the effectiveness of the lockdown and its impact on the mental health of those confined without access to fresh air and sun, we said.
Ms Glass found the lockdown was effective and necessary. Its implementation, however, was rushed and incompetent, and caused unnecessary confusion and distress. Telephone notifications, for example, did not start until the third day and almost half of all households at one tower, at 33 Alfred Street, North Melbourne, had not been contacted by July 10. Delays in translation and distribution meant written explanations were not provided until the fifth and sixth days, when directions were about to be revoked. The lockdown was lifted at eight of the towers after five days, but residents at 33 Alfred Street, where infection rates were highest, were detained for another nine days.
Most of the residents affected, the report says, found out about it when they saw uniformed police officers surrounding their homes. That was especially problematic. A significant proportion of tower residents, Ms Glass’ report says, came from non-European backgrounds: “Some had endured civil wars and dictatorships before settling in Australia, some even surviving torture at the hands of their former state. For them the overwhelming police presence was particularly traumatic. Their distress, when they spoke to us, was palpable.” The residents deserve an apology. But none was forthcoming on Thursday. Mr Andrews conveniently held his first press conference of the week a few minutes too early to comment on the report, Rachel Baxendale reports. Victorian Housing Minister Richard Wynne was left to carry the can but he said he would make “no apology” for “saving people’s lives”. The number of known active cases of coronavirus in the nine towers had doubled from 17 to 34 in the three days to July 4, Mr Wynne said, when the decision was made to lock them down. Ms Glass’ investigation found the immediate start of the lockdown appeared traceable to a Crisis Council of Cabinet meeting at 1.45pm on the Saturday. Her request for documents from the cabinet meeting unfortunately was denied. So much for transparency. Victoria’s deputy chief health officer, Annaliese van Diemen, who was acting chief health officer on the day of the lockdown, was given just 15 minutes’ notice before the July 4 media conference to consider and sign directions for the lockdown, including the potential human rights impacts. The immediacy of the lockdown was not on her advice, the report says. Dr van Diemen told the Ombudsman’s investigation that she did not believe ­delaying the lockdown by a day “would’ve made a hugely significant difference to the longer-term epidemiology” of the coronavirus outbreak in the towers. The decision, then, was political rather than medical. And it made a mockery of the Andrews government’s woke agenda.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
End of JobKeeper a step on road to economic recovery	The Australian	The loss of job subsidies could produce a spike in unemployment When Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg announced JobKeeper a year ago, Australia was on the edge of an economic abyss, the Treasurer recalled on Sunday. His department feared double-digit falls in GDP and a tripling in unemployment to 15 per cent, which would have seen more than 2 million Australians out of work. “We were all witness to the confronting scenes of tens of thousands of our fellow Australians queuing up outside Centrelink as the economic impact was felt from health restrictions being imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19,’’ Mr Frydenberg said during a visit to the Breast Cancer Network Australia in Melbourne on Sunday. It was a good place to mark the end of JobKeeper. The scheme enabled the BCNA, like many not-for-profit organisations, to continue to support the people who depend on it during COVID.
At the height of the pandemic, JobKeeper helped keep about a million businesses afloat and 3.8 million workers in jobs. Of those, about 680,000 businesses employing 2.8 million people have graduated from the scheme to stand on their own feet, with unemployment now 5.8 per cent. Most nations envy that record. But as Treasury Secretary Steven Kennedy warned last week, up to 150,000 jobs and 110,000 small businesses are at risk as the scheme ends and about 1.1 million workers lose their wage subsidy of up to $1000 a fortnight.
The anxieties of many workers and businesses are understandable, despite other, ongoing support packages. But however successful JobKeeper has been for so many, it is time to end the wage subsidy that has cost taxpayers $90bn. “We can’t keep spending borrowed money forever,’’ as Mr Frydenberg says. Continuing the scheme as the economy strengthens could hamper labour mobility by deterring some workers from moving on to more productive jobs. Australia is not out of the crisis yet, as Mr Frydenberg writes on Monday. We must remain disciplined and avoid higher taxes and a higher debt burden in future.
The start of the Easter holidays should be a good time to make the break from JobKeeper, although industry leaders in tourism and hospitality, understandably, are anxious about the impact of the change. But as Robyn Ironside reported last week, pent-up demand for leisure travel made Melbourne-Gold Coast Australia’s busiest air route in January, relegating traditional list-topper Melbourne-Sydney — adversely affected by the northern beaches COVID outbreak — to 13th. Other leisure routes such as Sydney to Ballina and Brisbane to Hamilton Island have also flourished. The industry’s concern about the plight of travel agents — who rely heavily on overseas bookings — and CBD businesses is understandable. That is why it is critical state governments resist the imposition of COVID travel restrictions as far as possible. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry also wants cruises to be reactivated and foreign-flagged ships allowed back into Australia to operate domestic cruises. That is a worthy objective, as soon as it is safe, when vaccinations are further advanced. As of Thursday, more than 400,000 Australians had had their first shot. For now, John Hart, executive chairman of ACCI’s chamber of tourism, expects 30,000 jobs to go in coming weeks.
At this stage, Greater Brisbane appears to have avoided another lockdown before Easter after health authorities corrected claims that a young man who tested positive held a party attended by 25 people while he was supposed to be isolating. With three community cases detected — including one where the patient has recovered — a lockdown would be costly overkill. Brisbane’s mini-outbreak has thrown thousands of travellers’ Easter travel plans into chaos, which will hurt airlines, accommodation, and other businesses, and jobs. Travellers from Queensland in Western Australia need to get tested for COVID-19 within 48 to 72 hours of arriving and self-quarantine for 14 days. Brisbane has been labelled “orange’’ under Victoria’s “traffic light” travel permit system. After applying for a permit, people entering Victoria from those areas must self-isolate, get a test within 72 hours of arriving, and stay isolated until a negative result is received. Tasmania has barred anyone who has attended a venue identified by Queensland Health unless they are an approved essential traveller. Until herd immunity to the virus, or as close to it as possible, is established, testing and contact tracing must remain the frontline of containing it. NSW, which has set the gold standard for contact tracing, is in a position to lift remaining restrictions on dancing, singing, and numbers at weddings, funerals, church services, sporting events and concerts, with venues allowed to fill to 100 per cent. Lifting such restrictions is a milestone, as is the end of JobKeeper. The latter signals the nation’s business-led recovery is under way, with new banking data revealing a surge in new and increased lending to small and medium businesses.
As Mr Frydenberg says, the next stages of recovery will centre on business investment incentives, tax cuts and reforming the skills and training system. The easing of COVID restrictions, and government incentives for households and businesses to spend, should help unlock $240bn of savings accumulated throughout the pandemic in households and businesses. The coming months, post-JobKeeper, will be challenging. But compared with Germany, facing another hard lockdown, and the British economy that contracted by 9.9 per cent last quarter, Australia has reason to be confident.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Never say never to simple, efficient, fair tax system	The Australian	The luxury car tax is a lemon and should be discontinued
How did we end up with a luxury car tax? First, by design, then neglect, followed by greed. When Peter Costello introduced the GST in 2000 he junked the annoying, often random wholesale sales tax that applied to goods. To help the local car industry — curtailing an expected rush to buy imported luxury vehicles, which attracted a much higher sales tax — the then treasurer created the LCT; it was a 25 per cent levy on vehicles costing more than $55,134. In 2008, the Rudd government jacked up the rate to 33 per cent. The current threshold is $67,525 (or $75,526 for fuel-efficient cars). It’s a dud tax, inefficient and discriminatory. Why cars?
In his 2010 review of the tax system Ken Henry called for the LCT to be abolished, noting the “truly absurd” tax had bipartisan support when it was introduced. In its 2014 review of the automotive manufacturing industry, the Productivity Commission said the LCT is a “higher cost and less efficient method of raising revenue than more broadly based taxes” and should be scrapped. It may have been a lemon, but successive governments made lemonade. From $175m in its first year, the LCT raised $675m last financial year and is projected to rake in $750m by 2022-23. It means buyers pay $6000 extra for a $90,000 imported vehicle.
With the end of local car production, there can be no justification for this tax, other than the capacity of the well-heeled to pay through the nose. Sure, Josh Frydenberg needs every loose coin wedged in the bucket seats to raise his “back in black” surplus, but the LCT’s days are numbered. Liberal backbench MPs and motor traders are putting pressure on the Treasurer to ditch it. On Wednesday, Mr Frydenberg said he had no plans to remove the LCT “but I would never say never in relation to that’’. Nudge nudge, wink wink. “We’ve got a series of taxes we’d like to remove, but we’re committed to keeping the nation’s balance sheet strong,’’ he said.
A government that spruiks its “lower taxes” credentials should aim higher, especially after so many reviews have told Canberra where the dead weights on the economy are. The nation needs a surge of business investment to lift our productivity growth rates, which lead to higher company profits and wages. A lower company tax rate, as well as one that does not discriminate between the size of enterprises, would be a spur to capital formation, job creation, innovation and skills development. It’s a battle for another day, given Labor’s predilection for spoiling and class war.
In his first budget last May, the Treasurer’s selling point was a surplus and “no new taxes”. As well, there was an extra $158bn in personal income tax cuts, taking the Coalition’s refund to $302bn over a decade. It was a genuine reform, with the goal of 94 per cent of taxpayers paying no more than 30 cents in the dollar (plus the Medicare Levy) by 2024. That flattening of the tax scales will aid workforce participation and aspiration, rewarding those who acquire skills. But the weakness in the plan is it simply hands back to workers the nasty theft that is bracket creep — and not all of it, either. The share of federal tax paid by individuals and companies will reach 75 per cent in 2022, up from 69 per cent in 2002, according to the Grattan Institute. Like other countries, we need indirect taxes, such as the GST, to do more of the heavy lifting in the years ahead. Scott Morrison, who once eyed such a move, has shelved that idea for the moment.Australia needs a simpler, fairer and more efficient tax system. The options are theoretically straightforward, but the politics of reform are dire. As we wrote here on Tuesday, we support the call by NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet to revamp the federation. The states should have better control and responsibility for their spending. They should not be penalised for fixing their finances. States are reliant on stamp duties from property transfers; these taxes hinder workers from moving to growth areas and keep people in homes that don’t suit them. An annual land tax would be better. Payroll taxes are a job killer. Economic reform must focus on federal-state finances, reviving the GST (meant to be a growth tax), and making company tax globally competitive. The LCT is a relic of our protectionist past. Let’s wave goodbye. Tax reform carries risk, given Canberra’s dysfunction, and will test our leaders. But the pay-off from a better, more robust tax system — higher living standards, sustainable public services, security — is worth it.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Hard lessons from Ruby Princess litany of errors	The Australian	The main advice to experts in the report was ‘do your job’
Bret Walker SC has done Australians an important service in his forensic, comprehensive report of the Special Commission of Inquiry into the Ruby Princess cruise ship fiasco. The findings, based on detailed facts and the legislated responsibilities of state and federal bodies, underline the need for health authorities in all jurisdictions, especially qualified “experts’’, to avoid similar errors, such as delays in testing vital swabs and sloppy decision-making. In the case of the Ruby Princess, the price of those missteps was the deaths of 28 passengers who contracted the virus on the ship in March and more than 1000 infections that were traced to the outbreak.
The public, especially Victorians, are looking to the COVID-19 Hotel Quarantine inquiry, which resumes hearings in Melbourne on Monday, for a similarly informative, politically dispassionate expose. The value of such inquiries is not only to hold authorities to account but to avoid the repeat of grave errors with life-threatening consequences and destructive repercussions for the wider society and the national economy. Like the Ruby Princess during the first wave of COVID-19, the hotel quarantine debacle has been a major harbinger of coronavirus cases during the second wave. As senior counsel assisting the Victoria inquiry, Tony Neal QC, said, “it might even be that every case of COVID-19 in Victoria in recent weeks could be sourced to the hotel quarantine program”.
In his report, Mr Walker concluded that in light of information available, the decision by the NSW Health Expert Panel to assess the risk on board the vessel as “low” — meaning, in effect, “do nothing” — was inexplicable and unjustifiable. It allowed 2647 passengers to disembark from the vessel and disperse into the community without adequate coronavirus checks. The delay in obtaining test results for the swabs taken from the Ruby Princess on the morning of March 19, which should have been tested immediately, was inexcusable. The NSW Health expert panel and the ministers responsible for overseeing them, Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Health Minister Brad Hazzard, especially have a litany of questions to answer arising from the 320-page report.
The commission has also demonstrated the folly of politicians trying to misuse the pandemic to score political points. Opposition home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally was initially inclined to blame Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton and the Australian Border Force for the fiasco. So was Ms Berejiklian. In March, Yoni Bashan reported that she told her partyroom meeting that ABF officials were ­responsible for the catastrophic decision to release 2700 cruise ship passengers into the community, risking contagion across the nation. But Mr Walker’s report was clear: “Neither the ABF nor any ABF officers played any part in the mishap.’’ To the contrary, as Mr Walker said, in view of their lack of medical or epidemiological expertise, it is as well for the public good that the ABF or the Department of Home Affairs do not bear any responsibility.
The one “fly in the ointment’’ as regards the commonwealth, Mr Walker found, was the response to a summons to a commonwealth officer to attend the commission. It was met with steps towards proceedings in the High Court. “Quite how this met the Prime Minister’s early assurance of full co-operation with the commission escapes me,’’ Mr Walker said. In light of the disaster that unfolded from the Ruby Princess, moves afoot to better protect maritime borders from COVID-19 are worthwhile. Bashan reports on Monday that all passengers and crew aboard cruise ships would be required to declare they did not have coronavirus symptoms under protocols being considered by the Morrison government and the states and territories. Those caught lying about such symptoms would face significant penalties. The measures are already in place for commercial vessels. As Mr Walker acknowledged, the failures in decision-making that led to the Ruby Princess catastrophe have largely been recognised by the expert panel’s physicians. Making recommendations to such experts, as he noted, would be inappropriate and unhelpful when they amount to no more than “do your job’’.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Labor pitch raises big questions	The Australian	The manifesto unloads a lot of unwanted policy baggage Anthony Albanese’s new policy manifesto, revealed exclusively by The Australian on Tuesday, has received an unintentional boost. The revolt it has triggered among seven Socialist Left unions might encourage voters to take a fresh look at the direction the Opposition Leader is offering. While the unions are indignant that 75 per cent of the content from the previous platform has been gutted, their tantrum should be to Labor’s advantage among swinging voters and small businesses.
Mr Albanese was right to go for a major spring clean. Post-COVID, the world is a very different place to what it was in the lead-up to the election in May last year, facing challenges that were unimaginable then. New policy imperatives that double down on growth, jobs and building prosperity — while also rebuilding the ravages of the pandemic across society — are needed. While the Socialist Left unions whinge, unfairly, that the draft platform is an “empty vessel”, Mr Albanese stopped well short of a clean sweep of policies that he and the nation might be better off without. Much, however, will depend on detail to be built around the scaffold. That can be provided only when the fallout from COVID is clearer, and nearer to the next election, which is due by May 2022.
Mr Albanese made a breakthrough in junking the promise to lower emissions by 45 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030. That pledge was an albatross around Labor’s neck in last year’s campaign. Former leader Bill Shorten was unable to quantify its cost to the economy, incomes and jobs, and the party’s credibility suffered as a result. As opposition resources spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon says, a 2030 target would be “redundant”. By the time of the next campaign, the timeframe available to achieve a medium-term target would be shorter and its costs more painful on top of the economic fallout from the coronavirus. A sharp difference remains between Labor’s policy of net-zero emissions by 2050 and the Coalition’s goal of zero emissions in the second half of the century. Much will depend on technological progress in the interim. The maintenance and enhancement of Australia’s comparative advantage in affordable energy should be a priority for both political sides.
Despite the complaining of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the Electrical Trades Union, the Community and Public Sector Union and others, the draft platform would afford unions significant extra power in workplace relations. It emphasises wage growth, protecting penalty rates and “full gender equality” in the form of 26 weeks’ paid parental leave and 10 days’ domestic violence leave. It would hand back power to unions targeted by the Australian Building and Construction Commission. And the final platform for Labor’s workplace relations policies will be negotiated with ACTU secretary Sally McManus and other union bosses. The party also is committed to increasing the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent, then 15 per cent. As the election draws closer, the credibility of Labor’s industrial relations wish list will depend on the capacity of business, including small businesses struggling in the aftermath of COVID, to pay, and the extent to which Labor would ensure hefty gains for unions would be offset by productivity improvements.
On the vital subject of taxation, it is reasonable at this stage that Mr Albanese has set out broad parameters. His platform promises a “progressive and sustainable” tax system, with incentive to encourage productive enterprise while guaranteeing adequate revenue to fund quality public services and bringing about “a more equal distribution of income and wealth”. The potential downside of that vision, however, will be in the detail. It will test whether Labor really has learned the lesson of the last election — that voters aspire to keep as much as possible of what they earn and do not welcome higher taxation, bigger government and the march of the nanny state. On the Australia-China relationship, Labor says Australia must engage effectively with ­Beijing, but sensibly notes the nation also must stand up for “democratic values” and safeguard our sovereignty. Releasing a pared-down manifesto makes sense. While cautious, this one gives Mr Albanese plenty of options to finetune Labor’s pitch to suit the times.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Playing politics on euthanasia	The Australian	The mark of a serious debate is attention to palliative care
Mid-campaign Queensland’s Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has promised to legalise voluntary assisted dying if she wins another term at the October 31 state election. Voters appreciate political parties being upfront about their intentions. However, a euthanasia bill is no ordinary policy. It’s a matter of life and death, going to fundamental values that underpin a civilised society. There are powerful, competing considerations involved which lead good people to disagree. Policy has to deal with complexities that are medical, ethical and practical, keeping in mind the risk of unintended consequences, doubts about consent and influence, and the danger of overreach and abuse. For all these reasons, the policy approach to euthanasia must be cautious, well-informed and orderly.
Here lies the problem. Ms Palaszczuk’s announcement came as a surprise. The Queensland Law Reform Commission has been looking at a draft bill and was not due to report until March. Now, the Premier says she will introduce legislation in February, pre-empting and expediting the law reform project. Catholic leaders claim they were misled and ask why the rush. Back in May, the Premier had put off the idea of a euthanasia bill, saying it was “very complex” and needed “further careful consideration”. And so, she set the law reform inquiry to work, and the issue seemed off the political agenda until after the election.
Now the Premier has not only decided to fast-track legislation but has made clear she would support it in a conscience vote. Put on the spot, LNP Opposition Leader Deb Frecklington, has declined to reveal her personal stance, saying she will wait for the law reform report. This contrast between the two leaders may help some voters make up their minds but it also risks distorting debate on the substance of euthanasia by framing it as a partisan political contest during a high-stakes election campaign. That’s at odds with the rationale of a conscience vote.
Dying with dignity is a pressing concern for many, especially in an ageing population with medical interventions able to prolong the life of the very sick. Governments are doing their job when they respond to such concerns with robust policymaking. But it’s difficult to resist the conclusion that Labor’s sudden change of mind is driven by polling that shows the Premier’s superior electoral appeal to the elderly demographic known as “Palaszczuk’s pensioners”. What the people are owed is not a campaign headline but a carefully thought-through policy. The Premier’s instinct in May was right; she should have waited for the law reform report. What’s done is done. Now or after the election, there still needs to be serious debate about euthanasia — and palliative care. The Premier acknowledged the link herself with the promise of $170m in extra funding for palliative care over six years. That’s welcome, although it’s a tenth of the new money needed, according to the peak body, Palliative Care Queensland. Especially if voluntary assisted dying is on offer, palliative care must be available as a viable choice, lest euthanasia become an oppressive default option. A series of inquiries has shown that palliative care is underfunded, patchy in provision, poorly organised, and in need of more trained staff. When the Premier committed Labor to euthanasia, she said the dying should be “empowered to consider all the options available”. Those are empty words unless palliative care is given much closer attention than it has had to date.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Myanmar closer to dictatorship	The Australian	The military junta would suit China’s strategic aims in the region A robust response from the world’s democracies is imperative after what Scott Morrison rightly described as the Myanmar military’s “disturbing” arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, 75, and other democracy leaders. What has taken place may not be a coup d’etat in the conventional sense. The military already controlled the principal levers of powers, as it has done for decades. But with China’s longstanding close ties to Myanmar’s corrupt military brass casting a dark shadow, the army’s lawless disregard for even the limited degree of democracy allowed Ms Suu Kyi and her supporters is a reminder of what is at stake in the crisis in the strategically placed nation of 54 million people on China’s southern border.
Despite living under house arrest for 15 years and winning the Nobel Peace prize, Ms Suu Kyi has shown herself a flawed practitioner of democracy. Her reputation as Myanmar’s democracy champion remains tarnished after her defence of the military’s genocidal campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority in 2017. But the democracy that countries such as the US and Australia did so much to nurture is worth saving. That must be the objective of calls such as that by Foreign Minister Marise Payne for the junta to “respect the rule of law, resolve disputes through lawful mechanisms and release immediately all civilian leaders and others who have been detained unlawfully”.
The crackdown came shortly before Myanmar’s parliament was due to meet following the election in November last year in which Ms Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won by a landslide — 396 out of 476 available seats, against 33 for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party. Military leader Min Aung Hlaing appeared dumbfounded by the result. Like Donald Trump after the US election, he made expansive, evidence-free allegations of fraud. He demanded that parliament be deferred, a call the NLD rejected. Following the detention of the NLD leadership, General Hlaing declared a 12-month state of emergency, took sole charge and, as dictators do, promised there would be “new, free and fair elections” after that. Beyond the general’s pique over the election drubbing, it is hard to understand why he has taken such action.
Myanmar’s “democratic” constitution guarantees the military 25 per cent of parliamentary seats, whatever happens at the polls. No major changes can be achieved without military approval. The generals’ vast enrichment through their shameless control of big business, including factories, four steel plants, a cement plant and an insurance monopoly, remains untouched; the defence budget is shielded from parliamentary scrutiny. Much of the military’s wealth was built up in the decades when Myanmar was the target of crippling Western sanctions for its suppression of democracy. China saw an opening and built close ties with the ruling generals. These included oil and gas operations, with Myanmar pumping natural gas from the Bay of Bengal to China and a new oil pipeline that feeds Middle East crude through Myanmar to a refinery in Yunnan, China. Meeting General Hlaing last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called the two countries “brothers” and praised the Myanmar military’s “national revitalisation”. That closeness underlines the challenge confronting Western and non-Western democracies. A reimposition of the stringent Western sanctions in place before the 2015 election won by Ms Suu Kyi appears likely. But the danger, Amanda Hodge reported on Tuesday, is that doing so would “almost certainly propel Myanmar closer to China, for which dictatorships pose no obstacle to a harmonious relationship”. The Biden administration has no easy options in seeking to honour its pledge to defend democracy around the world. Neither do other nations, including Australia, that did so much to help in the rebirth of democracy in Myanmar. The re-establishment of a full military dictatorship would be a chance for China to further its expansion. What hopes remain for democracy and human rights in Myanmar will be set back even further if the generals take the country closer into China’s oppressive sphere of influence.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Family’s faith, grace in tragedy	The Australian	The morning after his three children and their cousin were killed by an alleged intoxicated driver, Danny Abdallah spoke with a broken heart about little lives lost on a Sydney street. His simple, loving words for Antony, 13, Angelina, 12, Sienna, 9, and Veronique Sakr, 11, struck a chord with a nation stunned by the tragedy. Mr Abdallah said he was numb, yet in his calm, tender way transcended the sorrow by speaking of the joy the children brought to their parents. He urged drivers to be careful, to watch out for innocent kids like his own, walking to the shops to buy ice cream on a stiflingly hot night.As the site of the accident became a floral shrine of remembrance, Mr Abdallah’s wife, Leila, said she was not going to hate the man behind the wheel but forgive him. It was a rare act of grace in a chaotic world that too often knows violence, retribution and hatred. “I am sad. I am heartbroken. But I am at peace because I know my kids are in a better place,” she said. Pain, suffering and loss are inescapable; there’s the rub of life. Yet the Abdallahs are being sustained by their Maronite Catholic faith. Life cannot be the same for them but, as Kevin Donnelly wrote on Tuesday, “while the loss and pain will never be erased, in prayer and communal grieving there is solace”. May the families come to know this shocking loss is shared deeply and widely, and that as a nation we mourn the four children taken from them.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Reopening schools a milestone	The Australian	The move will boost growth, jobs and students’ learning
The return of about four million students to their classrooms in all states and territories is a vital step in Australia’s return to full strength, as the COVID-19 pandemic eases. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, who previously had announced schools would remain closed for the rest of this term, had no alternative on Tuesday but to announce a resumption of classroom teaching from May 26. Victoria is last cab off the rank and anything else would have been a further breach of the advice of health experts. Students are back already in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia, and some are back in Queensland and NSW. Remaining out of step with the rest of Australia would have undermined Victoria’s recovery. It also would have hurt students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds for whom home learning has been problematic. For most, digital technology has been a lifeline, which was not the case during the US polio epidemic last century when research showed school closures damaged young people’s prospects. For returning students, the first half of this year is a time they will not forget.
Schools reopening should boost communities’ morale as part of what Scott Morrison describes as getting out from under the doona. It will add nearly $2.2bn to the economy, Josh Frydenberg told parliament on Tuesday. A week ago, Treasury analysis presented to the national cabinet showed classroom closures had led to more than 300,000 job losses and sliced 3 per cent from gross domestic product. Those losses, arguably, were avoidable. From the outset of the coronavirus crisis, the Prime Minister, armed with the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, has been consistent in maintaining that schools should be open. COVID-19, as Mr Morrison noted, has a very low rate of transmission between children.
State and territory leaders and teachers’ unions have been more cautious, especially Mr Andrews. Most parents, bombarded with conflicting advice, played it safe and kept their children at home. But as the economy opens up, the gradual return of classes, to be completed within a couple of weeks, will free parents to concentrate on their jobs at home, to return to their workplaces as conditions allow and, in some cases, to look for work as economic activity gathers pace.
In terms of learning, Education Minister Dan Tehan says the evidence is clear that nearly half of Australian children and young people are at risk of adverse effects on their educational outcomes by being physically disconnected from school. If online delivery were to continue for much longer, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, those with complex learning needs, those with disabilities and indigenous students would lose valuable ground in numeracy and reading. These are the essential building blocks of further educational attainment and an important determinant of students’ job prospects.Given the disparate assessment and tertiary entrance systems across the nation, most states and territories are adjusting coursework for the rest of the year to give Year 12 students certainty after weeks of disruption. Mr Tehan, keen to encourage private schools to reopen, offered financial incentives for them to do so. And a network of Victorian private schools, in a challenge to Mr Andrews, demanded the discretion to reopen in regions largely unaffected by COVID-19. Now the confusion is over. New clusters of the virus here and overseas are a reminder of the need for caution. The measures outlined by Mr Andrews — staggered drop-off systems and breaks, physical distancing for adults and extra cleaning — are good precautions. And the COVIDSafe app will help alert communities of any outbreaks.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Striking balance between caution and opening up	The Australian	The mystery of the contract security guards is still unsolved Victoria’s hotel quarantine inquiry was right to ask for telephone and text message records of Premier Daniel Andrews and his staff from March 27 this year. And Mr Andrews and his team are doing the right thing in providing them. So is Department of Premier and Cabinet secretary Chris Eccles, whose records were also called for. The situation needs transparency. That said, the records are unlikely to reveal who told the former chief commissioner of Victoria Police, Graham Ashton, that private security would be used to guard the hotels. In his statement to the inquiry, Mr Ashton referred to a six-minute phone call he received in which he learnt details about the private security plan — but he could not remember who the caller was. Mr Andrews says he did not speak to Mr Ashton and does not believe any of his staff did, either.
In that case, the inquiry might need to examine phone and text records of other ministers, their staff and senior bureaucrats. It might also need to reopen hearings. As we said on Saturday, these should be resumed to investigate issues raised by former health Minister Jenny Mikakos in her written submission to the inquiry on Friday. Ms Mikakos blamed subversion of cabinet processes by Mr Andrews for the abject failings of the program. It was set up in haste, she said, with Mr Andrews giving responsibility for the scheme’s design and implementation to Jobs Minister Martin Pakula’s department. Normal decision-making mechanisms, lines of accountability and reporting were supplanted. She also urged the inquiry to treat some of Mr Andrews’ evidence “with caution”. The “weight of evidence”, she said, pointed to a decision being made to use contract labour during “or soon after” the March 27 national cabinet meeting.
The inquiry is yet to be given an answer to the biggest mystery in the deadly saga — who authorised the use of private security firms to supervise quarantine hotels when police and Australian defence personnel were available. The inquiry ended hearings with nobody from the Andrews government putting up their hand to accept responsibility. Nor did anybody from the government, police or bureaucracy shed any light on who did. Victorians, and the rest of the nation, cannot afford for the inquiry not to get to the bottom of that crucial mystery. Serious security breaches at the hotels were the main factor in Victoria’s second wave of COVID-19, which has caused almost 800 deaths, severe social problems and economic catastrophe.
In a controversial move on Sunday, Mr Andrews extended Victoria’s state of emergency and state of disaster for four more weeks. Over 24 hours, 12 new cases and one death were recorded. Melbourne’s metro 14-day rolling average now stands at 9.3, with 10 cases of an unknown source. Regional Victoria has a 14-day rolling average of 0.4 cases. Restrictions were expected to ease next weekend but are dependent on the rolling average falling below five. Mr Andrews insists the decision stems from detailed public health advice. But, given the need to contain rather than eliminate coronavirus, the caseload hardly justifies the extension of restrictions. Is 12 new cases a state of disaster, or emergency? NSW had three in the past 24 hours; 18 in the past week.
It shows, after months of lockdown, that the virus is stubborn. We are not suggesting complacency. To the contrary, health authorities and political leaders need to devise effective strategies, and communicate them to the public, clearly and often, in all languages, about how our society can best live with the virus and minimise risk, especially to the most vulnerable. Hand sanitising and social distancing are already all but forgotten in parts of the nation. The last thing Australia needs is to find itself in the same predicament as Britain, which is back to where it was in March, as hospitals again fill up with COVID-19 patients. Almost 14,000 new cases were reported on Friday in the UK, and 87 deaths.In newspaper ads on Sunday, 78 business operators complained the Andrews government’s lockdown had put hundreds of thousands of small businesses on the brink of bankruptcy. One organiser, FlexiGroup chairman Andrew Abercrombie, said the government was obsessed with eradication. “Victoria now has similar case numbers to where NSW was when it reopened,’’ he said. “Yet we are closed for business, while businesses in NSW are roaring back to life.’’ That advice makes sense. The Andrews government should factor it in.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine

The inquiry ended hearings with nobody from the Andrews government putting up their hand to accept responsibility. Nor did anybody from the government, police or bureaucracy shed any light on who did. Victorians, and the rest of the nation, cannot afford for the inquiry not to get to the bottom of that crucial mystery. Serious security breaches at the hotels were the main factor in Victoria’s second wave of COVID-19, which has caused almost 800 deaths, severe social problems and economic catastrophe.
In a controversial move on Sunday, Mr Andrews extended Victoria’s state of emergency and state of disaster for four more weeks. Over 24 hours, 12 new cases and one death were recorded. Melbourne’s metro 14-day rolling average now stands at 9.3, with 10 cases of an unknown source. Regional Victoria has a 14-day rolling average of 0.4 cases. Restrictions were expected to ease next weekend but are dependent on the rolling average falling below five. Mr Andrews insists the decision stems from detailed public health advice. But, given the need to contain rather than eliminate coronavirus, the caseload hardly justifies the extension of restrictions. Is 12 new cases a state of disaster, or emergency? NSW had three in the past 24 hours; 18 in the past week.
It shows, after months of lockdown, that the virus is stubborn. We are not suggesting complacency. To the contrary, health authorities and political leaders need to devise effective strategies, and communicate them to the public, clearly and often, in all languages, about how our society can best live with the virus and minimise risk, especially to the most vulnerable. Hand sanitising and social distancing are already all but forgotten in parts of the nation. The last thing Australia needs is to find itself in the same predicament as Britain, which is back to where it was in March, as hospitals again fill up with COVID-19 patients. Almost 14,000 new cases were reported on Friday in the UK, and 87 deaths. In newspaper ads on Sunday, 78 business operators complained the Andrews government’s lockdown had put hundreds of thousands of small businesses on the brink of bankruptcy. One organiser, FlexiGroup chairman Andrew Abercrombie, said the government was obsessed with eradication. “Victoria now has similar case numbers to where NSW was when it reopened,’’ he said. “Yet we are closed for business, while businesses in NSW are roaring back to life.’’ That advice makes sense. The Andrews government should factor it in.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Tokyo visit emphasises strength of strategic ties	The Australian	The nation has no better friend in Asia than Japan In Tokyo on Tuesday, Scott Morrison was right to extol the mutual defence pact agreed in principle with new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga as “a pivotal moment in the history of Japan-Australia ties”. Not since its 1960 Status of Forces Agreement with the US has Japan concluded such a far-reaching strategic defence pact with any country. The Reciprocal Access Agreement is a legal and administrative framework for military forces operating in both countries. It will be a key plank of Australia’s and Japan’s “responses to an increasingly challenging security environment in our region amid more uncertain strategic circumstances”, the Australian Prime Minister says. As he told Paul Kelly, it means “our defence forces can operate in and around Japan, and Japanese self-defence forces can operate in and around Australia”. The RAA will form the bedrock of bilateral co-operation and will be an important arm of the broader regional alliance led by the US that includes the Quad nations — the US, India, Australia and Japan. Mr Suga, who was Shinzo Abe’s loyal lieutenant for many years and took over in September, is showing he is as committed as his predecessor to the bilateral relationship.
As a backdrop to Mr Morrison’s historic two-day trip to Tokyo, on which he became the first international leader to meet Mr Suga, The Australian’s two-day Strategic Forum was timely. China inevitably was the dominant theme on the first day of the forum. Josh Frydenberg struck the right tone when he emphasised that Australia stood ready to re-engage in “respectful and beneficial dialogue” with Beijing, despite damaging trade pressures that threatened our exports. “Both our countries,” he pointed out, “have benefited hugely from our growing trade relationship; without this, we both lose.” But the Treasurer was emphatic: our national interest was non-negotiable and always would be protected, first and foremost. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe agreed with Mr Frydenberg about the mutually advantageous trading relationship with China. But as Dr Lowe told the forum, Australia needed to focus on broadening markets. Both India and Indonesia offered “incredible opportunity for growth”, he said.
In a joint statement, Mr Morrison and Mr Suga “expressed serious concerns” about tensions in the East and South China seas, and “reconfirmed their strong opposition to any coercive or unilateral attempts to change the status quo and thereby increase tensions in the region”. Within hours of their announcement of the RAA, the fire and brimstone Chinese Communist Party propaganda machine launched a full-scale broadside. Australia and Japan would pay a price for signing a “very dangerous” defence agreement, the CCP threatened. It accused both nations of being “US tools”. China would take countermeasures, it said.
There is little new or constructive in such invective. But it highlights the relentless belligerence continuing to emerge from Beijing that has made it imperative for democracies across the region and beyond to look to their strategic alliances to defend themselves against Chinese belligerence. Stability in the face of China’s aggression is vital. China has nothing to be concerned about from the RAA, Mr Morrison emphasised in Tokyo, saying: “I think it adds to the stability of the region.” As Greg Sheridan wrote on Wednesday, Tokyo and Canberra are “bit by bit inching ever closer to a full military alliance. It’s not there yet and it would be wrong to misrepresent it. But it’s getting very close. Australia and Japan, in their common alliance with the US, are as near to an Asian NATO as it gets.” A NATO-style alliance for the Indo-Pacific was touted recently by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. As our ambassador in Washington, Arthur Sinodinos, told the Strategic Forum, the Biden administration is likely to be no less hard-headed about China than the Trump administration. China “just hasn’t got friends in Washington at the moment”, The Australian’s Washington correspondent Cameron Stewart said. But Stewart said president-elect Joe Biden had been “surprisingly sparse” about how he intended to proceed and whether he would maintain the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump. The engagement between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Biden in the first month or two of Mr Biden’s term will set the tone of the relationship, as former Australian ambassador to the US Joe Hockey said. That engagement will be vital to the world, especially this region. After Mr Morrison’s lightning visit he will be in quarantine for 14 days. That reflects his determination to make the trip to Japan, his first abroad since the onslaught of COVID-19. It shows the closeness of Australia’s relationship with the world’s third-largest economy and a country that is a key trade and investment partner as well as a political, cultural and strategic ally.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Food, drinks sector needs to ‘grab the ball and run’	The Australian	The nation is well placed to capitalise on natural advantages From gourmet cooking at home boosting supermarket sales to the demand for fine wines and pizza, The Australian and Visy’s Global Food Forum is timely as the nation emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. Online sales of home-delivered meals and groceries are increasing; so are sales of up-market ingredients and equipment such as chef’s knives as more people stay home and cook as an alternative to dining out — especially in Victoria. The quality and range of our nation’s produce is second to none. And COVID-19, while deadly and devastating, has created new opportunities for farmers, processors, manufacturers, retailers and related enterprises such as packaging and delivery. Businesses cannot afford to ignore them. For the sake of jobs at home and consumers across the world, it is vital that the sector steps up, at a time when the World Health Organisation fears a doubling of child malnutrition.
Agriculture and food manufacturing are areas of natural comparative advantage for Australia. And the virus has underlined the importance of safe and secure food supplies, as forum speaker Coca-Cola Amatil chief executive Alison Watkins said. COVID had highlighted the clean, green image of the nation’s food products, making our industries a safe source of supply and a great place to invest as countries looked to diversify their supply chains.
In his keynote address on Wednesday, Anthony Pratt, executive chairman of Australasian cardboard-box maker Visy, affirmed the importance of the Morrison government’s decision to select food and beverage as one of six manufacturing sectors to benefit from $1.5bn in support in last week’s budget. Since The Australian and Visy launched the Global Food Forum in 2013, manufactured food exports have grown from $18bn to $28bn, despite drought and bushfires, Mr Pratt said. In eight years, 1400 food factories had been built in Australia.
The settings for expanding food production and value adding are in place. But as Arnotts chief executive George Zoghbi and Ms Watkins said, Australia was not exporting nearly enough of the premium value-added foods that it produced. The industry, they said, should “grab the ball and run” by making investments in value-added production to capitalise on the Morrison government’s vision for a manufacturing-led recovery from coronavirus. As Mr Zoghbi pointed out, Australia has been selling “all the ingredients that goes into the food supply chain” to the rest of the world for years. What the economy needed now, he said, was to sell finished goods. Or as Mr Pratt put it: as well as selling wheat for $100 a tonne, more of it should be made into bread and sold at $5000 a tonne. It was important to avoid a high bulk-low value export cycle, which did not create a lot of jobs. Despite Australia signing nine free trade agreements in 10 years, with four more under negotiation, the need remains to broaden and diversify export opportunities. As Glenda Korporaal and Damon Kitney report, wine industry veteran Doug Rathbone told the forum that Australia’s wine industry was being threatened with import tariffs as early as this week in China, as a political exercise. The Australian barley industry is still reeling from the imposition of tariffs of 80 per cent in May, which effectively has killed its $1.2bn export market to China. As the conference heard, Australia’s Asian neighbours, including China, will account for about 70 per cent of the increase in global food demand by 2050, opening up big opportunities. The forum continues on Thursday.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Unlock gas reserves to lift domestic supply, exports	The Australian	The nation must capitalise on its vast energy resources
Resources Minister Matt Canavan’s concern to ensure Australia has sufficient gas supplies for domestic use is understandable, especially when productivity and growth are sluggish. In a nation with ample reserves, gas should be a vital part of our affordable energy mix and an important transition fuel in the slow, gradual shift from coal-fired power to renewables to cover baseload power. But Senator Canavan’s domestic gas reservation plan, announced on Friday, which the minister will develop this year in conjunction with the states and territories, is a second-best option.
Rather than focusing on the most critical issue — gas supply, which is the purview of the states — a reservation plan would seek to ensure adequate supplies by manipulating the market process. The issue again underlines the lack of an effective national energy policy that would capitalise on the nation’s comparative advantages by driving export growth and ensuring affordable power for large-scale industrial users.
On Monday, resources leaders pointed out the risks and shortcomings of a domestic gas reservation scheme. Richard Cottee, one of the founders of Queensland’s booming $70bn natural gas industry, said a domestic gas reservation scheme on the east coast could devalue the price of gas and lessen state royalties. Such outcomes, perversely, would ­reward NSW and Victoria, which had locked up reserves, Mr Cottee, chairman of State Gas and Elixir Energy, said. The policy, he said, could lessen the royalties received by Queensland and South Australia while enabling the Victorian and NSW governments to posture their “anti-gas” stands. A reservation scheme, he said, was a rationing exercise. The better option would be increasing supply and competition.
Victoria should ditch its ideologically driven moratorium on onshore gas exploration as soon as practical. NSW, which has locked up major gas supplies for too long for fear of political repercussions, also has much to answer for. The current policies of our two largest states have held their economies, and the nation, back. At least, in NSW, after years of drawn-out regulatory hurdles, energy producer Santos expects to receive a decision on its $3bn Narrabri coal seam gas project in the first half of this year. Santos has previously called for a clear timeline, arguing the development could help ease the tight east coast market by providing up to 50 per cent of the gas needs of our largest state.
Senator Canavan needs to take note of the views of the Queensland ­Resources Council — led by former Howard government resources minister Ian Macfarlane — and the Australian Industry Group. Both are sceptical that domestic gas reserves are necessary or have any benefits. Senator Canavan said we “can’t repeat the mistakes of the past in just letting our gas be shipped overseas with no thought to our domestic requirements’’. Large industrial users, such as Manufacturing Australia chief executive Ben Eade, agree. Mr Eade, who argues a reserve scheme is “in the national interest”, says gas reservation already happening in Queensland and Western Australia is serving both producers and customers well.Australia has much to gain by stepping up gas exploration, supply and export. After years of dependence on Middle East oil, gas production and shale oil have been major factors in the US becoming energy self-sufficient.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
New vaccine plant builds on our scientific strengths	The Australian	The nation will be well placed to fight future pandemics The most successful civilisations and nations historically are those with the capacity to strengthen their position and help their people by building out of the ravages of war, tragedy and plague. In the wake of the sometimes deadly COVID-19 pandemic and its fallout, especially in Victoria, Australians can take heart from the $1.8bn agreement between the Morrison government and biotech giant CSL to be announced on Monday. The far-sighted development will see the largest biotech and vaccine manufacturing plant in the southern hemisphere built in Melbourne. The pandemic, currently crippling the US, Britain, Europe and developing nations, has demonstrated the dangers of future global security threats. Vaccines are not necessarily a panacea; and they take time to develop. But the plant, a major part of the Morrison government’s post-pandemic manufacturing strategy, will have the capacity to deliver pandemic and seasonal flu vaccines that will quarantine Australians from global supply chain shortages or queues. Aside from pandemics and flu vaccines, it will produce a vaccine against Q fever, a debilitating disease caught from livestock. It can harm patients for years. It will also make a range of life-saving anti-venoms.
In an age when science and technology are increasingly important cornerstones of nations’ wellbeing and prosperity, the facility will create 1300 high-end bio and med-tech jobs, as well as 520 construction jobs when building starts next year. It will be funded through an $800m construction investment by CSL subsidiary Seqirus and a $1bn commitment by the commonwealth to purchase all future vaccinations for the next 12 years. That worthwhile investment of taxpayers’ money in nation-building will help keep Australians safe by strengthening our long-term sovereign medical capabilities, creating the ability to develop new vaccines when needed. Scott Morrison says the new complex will be the most hi-tech in the southern hemisphere, using cell-based technology to enable faster production in the event of pandemics.
While Victoria, NSW and Queensland again recorded no new transmissions of COVID on Sunday, the predicament of other nations was a sharp reminder that the pandemic will remain a threat until a safe, effective vaccine is in place. The number of new infections in the US surged to another record of 184,514 on Friday, a 20 per cent increase from Thursday. In Britain, 26,860 new cases and 462 coronavirus deaths were recorded on Saturday. Italy’s second wave has put more than 33,000 people in hospital, more than during the dark months of March-April, and is killing about 600 a day. The spread of the virus through minks in at least six countries is also a concern.
Given the disease’s contagion, Australia’s national cabinet, correctly, is taking nothing for granted as we head towards Christmas in a strong position, with internal borders reopening, albeit too slowly in some cases. At its 31st meeting on Friday, national cabinet endorsed the review of the contact tracing and outbreak management systems of each state and territory, led by Chief Scientist Dr Alan Finkel. All 22 recommendations of the report will be adopted. States will commit to faster COVID-19 testing and notification systems, with results to be made available within 24 hours and potential contacts notified within two days of the test. In the event of any outbreak, the approach will be to go hard and go early. A digital data exchange will be created to enable states and territories to easily access and transfer information about cases and contacts where people have crossed borders. The review also found states and territories should share new technologies, such as electronic venue and workplace attendance registration systems, smartphone apps to monitor self-quarantine, new diagnostic tests and wastewater surveillance. To their credit, states and territories were assessed as now having strong contact tracing and outbreak management systems in place. From now on, they will stress-test their systems regularly. As the Prime Minister said after the meeting, such protections would keep the nation open. Those at the frontlines of fighting coronavirus can be proud Mr Morrison is forwarding a copy of the review to US president-elect Joe Biden. It will also be available to other countries. There is no room for complacency. Eleven months after the first cases of a then-mystery disease were linked to a Chinese wildlife market, a World Health Organisation investigation is under way. But as The Times reports, concessions to Beijing are undermining it. There is still no timeline for the international team to enter China and no guarantee who it may interview, what records it will see or whether it will be allowed to visit Wuhan, the city that was ground zero. WHO has agreed that Chinese researchers will conduct the early stages of the investigation. Against that disturbing background, Australia is right in fine-tuning testing and contact tracing, and investing in the new vaccine plant.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Make do and mend as we await Attack submarines	The Australian	The nation will rely on the Collins subs until at least 2034 On June 10, 2011, under the headline “Not a single submarine seaworthy’’, Cameron Stewart revealed: “For the first time in a generation, Australia does not have a single submarine available to defend the nation today. The Australian understands the entire fleet of six Collins-class submarines cannot be put to sea despite the navy’s claim that two of them remain officially ‘operational’.’’ The situation was an embarrassment for the navy, whose attempts to improve the $10bn Collins fleet had been stymied by breakdowns, accidents and the growing unreliability of the ageing vessels.
Fast-forward nine years and the saga continues. But Australia’s region is more volatile, the Collins-class subs, designed in the 1980s, are older and taxpayers face a bill of at least $3.5bn to overhaul them. At least $583m per Collins sub will be spent, Ben Packham reports on Monday, to rebuild their main motors, generators and key systems. The impost is unavoidable. The first of the much-anticipated 12 new Attack-class submarines, to be built in Adelaide to the specifications of French company Naval Group, are not due to enter service until at least 2034. The last is scheduled to become operational in the 2050s.
Until the first of the new vessels goes into service, Australia cannot afford a dangerous, protracted capability gap. The new acquisition, Australia’s largest-ever defence investment, is vital to national security. By 2035, about half of the world’s submarines will be operating in the Indo-Pacific region, the 2016 Defence white paper forecast.
The Abbott government originally envisaged that the replacements for the Collins-class subs would be in service in the mid-2020s. But by April 2016, when the Turnbull government awarded the contract for the 12 new subs to the French, the delivery date was set for the early 2030s. The project was originally mooted to cost $50bn to build and about $50bn to maintain over the subs’ 50-year lifespan. But in May we reported the cost is likely to be $90bn to build the boats, on top of $145bn for maintenance. Those figures take into account the effects of inflation and currency fluctuations.
In January, an Australian Nationa­l Audit Office report disclosed that the new submarines’ design phase was running nine months late. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the delay was essential to get the design right to “reduce costly changes and uncertainties’’ when the submarines were built. She had a point; design is the foundation of good performance. But, given the potential for cost overruns and the ageing Collins fleet, keeping the project on time is vital.
Conscious of the long-running maintenance challenges associated with the Collins-class subs that were also built in Adelaide to a Swedish design, The Australian was always sceptical about the “populist protectionism” behind the Turnbull government’s decision to build the new vessels in Adelaide. Mr Turnbull announced the decisions ahead of the 2016 federal election, when the demise of the car industry in South Australia was a sore point with voters. We could only accept the government’s word that, based on the advice of the Defence Department and outside experts, after a long assessment process, the French boats will be best suited to our needs compared with the German and Japanese bids. These were also judged to be of high quality.
Buying a ready-made product off the shelf would have strengthened Australia’s defence preparedness much earlier. As a report to government by the Rand Corporation in 2015 noted, every piece of homemade defence equipment is more expensive and takes longer to build than alternatives. Purchasing subs off the shelf from overseas would have avoided refitting some, if not all, the Collins subs. On the other hand, building the new submarines should boost Australia’s capacity to produce defence equipment independently. The subs project will have a significant impact on the budget in the years of recovery from COVID-19. After years of expense in fixing the Collins-class boats and years of delays in settling on their replacements, the $3.5bn cost of refitting the old subs, as the navy waits until 2034 for the up-to-date Attack-class subs, is yet another step in a long, inefficient chronicle. At a time when national security is paramount, the ADF needs to do better in procuring other vital equipment.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Testing and reporting vital to boosting school results	The Australian	The nation’s education systems need to lift the bar higher The poor showing of Australian school students in basic skills and subjects in international testing is a good reason to retain and if possible improve national testing. A review of the National Assessment Program: Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) has recommended an overhaul and expansion of testing to include science and technology, maths and critical and creative thinking. We are yet to see what content the additional sections would cover. But former Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority chairman Barry McGaw, who led the review, and his team were right to resist the pressure of teachers unions to scrap testing of all students and replace it with sample testing. That option, Professor McGaw told Rebecca Urban on Monday, would leave parents in the dark and deny schools accurate information about how they were performing compared with other schools. The review was commissioned by NSW with support from Queensland, the ACT and Victoria.
The review’s recommendation that testing be carried out in Years 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 (rather than Year 9) was sensible. Testing in Year 10 when students were more mature, the panel pointed out, would be useful for when decisions about choices needed to be made about upper secondary subjects. And testing as early in the school year as possible, rather than in May as at present, the report noted, would give teachers a measure of students’ starting points for the year. It would also debunk the criticism of unions and education academics that testing narrows the focus of classroom learning as teachers feel pressured to “teach to the test’’. That should not be the case.
Unlike subject tests, NAPLAN measures skills rather than knowledge. The only effective way to prepare students for NAPLAN, as the report says, is implementing the Australian Curriculum. But nor is it problematic if the testing focuses more attention in classrooms on “the basics’’. The problems too many students face with reading, writing and numeracy, the building blocks of education, are at the heart of many education problems.
The depth of that crisis was clear in December when Australia had its worst showing in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) test. In global education rankings, the nation’s 15-year-olds performed at a significantly lower standard in reading, maths and science than a decade ago, despite government funding for schools rising by more than $20bn. Our maths performance equated to the loss of more than a year’s worth of schooling since 2003. In light of the need to lift the bar, the NAPLAN review recommended that the level of the National Minimum Standards on the NAPLAN scales be reviewed to ascertain if they are too low. The report also backs the development of new “proficient” and “highly proficient’’ benchmarks. As Professor McGaw says, Australia sets national minimum standards too low, “and the education ministers think that as well”. We need to aim higher.
The strength of NAPLAN, the results of which are reported on the MySchool website introduced by Julia Gillard, is its accountability. It informs parents about their own children’s achievements and that of schools. High fees do not necessarily produce high scores. NAPLAN also provides broader snapshots of how state and territory education systems are working in different year levels, and whether particular classes improve or fall back as they progress through the system. From 2008 to 2019, national NAPLAN results have revealed improvement in reading and numeracy in primary schools but not in secondary schools, a static performance in writing in Years 3 and 5 and a decline in Years 7 and 9. They have also revealed that Queensland and Western Australia have improved more than others, but they started behind the ACT, NSW and Victoria and have not surpassed them. On Saturday, Education Minister Dan Tehan pointed to the case of South Australia, where Years 3 and 5 reading and writing results have improved after the recent introduction of statewide phonics screening in government schools. As Mr Tehan says, NAPLAN will have a role in measuring the impact of disruptions caused by COVID-19 on students’ learning. But that should not preclude the system being improved. Education standards will shape our future in an increasingly competitive, complex world. They are too important an area of social policy to be shielded from scrutiny. Parents are entitled to know about the quality of schools before they enrol their children; taxpayers are entitled to know if the system they fund is working. The misguided, self-centred push by unions to scrap comprehensive testing and abandon transparency is indefensible. This report suggests the system needs refinement. But whatever its new name, NAPLAN’s basic structure, which holds teachers, principals, education authorities and states to account, is serving our children, who are our future.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Defence equipment for the era	The Australian	The nation’s geopolitical environment has become more dangerous The Defence Strategic Update, launched by Scott Morrison in a measured speech delivered on July 1 at the Australian Defence Force Academy, demonstrated that our government understood how dramatically Australia’s geopolitical environment had deteriorated since the defence white paper of 2016. Although China was named only seven times in the text of the document, the update was explicit in explaining the rationale for the force structure decisions it contained. In polite diplomatic language, the update acknowledged that it represented a recalibration of our defence posture and degrees of readiness because “habits of co-operation in the Indo-Pacific are being challenged”.
The Prime Minister noted that there were some disturbing echoes of the 1930s in the present global situation. Significantly, the update discarded the comfortable assumption that Australia could enjoy up to 10 years’ warning of a threat from a major power to our vital interests or sovereignty. This newspaper supported the government’s assessment. In particular, we welcomed the substantial investment in enhanced maritime strike weaponry and sensors, as well as cyber capabilities, to enable the Australian Defence Force to hit harder further from our homeland bases, and to detect and defeat hybrid “grey zone” threats of the kind that our most likely adversaries have developed.
Mr Morrison and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds solemnly committed to strict accountability in the delivery of the suite of enhanced and expensive capabilities. Given the sacrifice that so many Australian taxpayers have made this year, the assurance that every dollar of defence expenditure would provide commensurate value was welcome.
Yet, as Ben Packham revealed on Monday, the design, procurement and introduction to service of the army’s helicopter fleet has been plagued by numerous problems. The Department of Defence reported that the MRH-90 Taipan and the ARH Tiger were grounded for significant periods. The MRH-90’s flying hours fell short of projections by 46 per cent, and the ARH’s by 35 per cent.
According to Defence, chronic shortages of spare parts severely curtailed readiness of the MRH-90, while a design flaw makes it impossible to man the door gun of the helicopter while troops are disembarking. This adds to a sorry saga of bungled defence procurements by Australia, most notably the delayed delivery of the replacement for the Collins-class submarine. While Ms Reynolds has inherited these problems from her predecessor, Christopher Pyne, it is up to her to jolt the unwieldy Russell Hill bureaucracy out of its torpor.
Australian defence procurement has a long history of inexplicably poor decisions. Too often, expensive platforms are delivered late, accompanied by budget blowouts. However, as Packham also reported, the air force has achieved initial operational capability with the controversial F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. This offers a glimmer of good news. This fifth-generation stealth platform gives Australia an edge over air forces in our immediate region. It is a very capable aircraft, though its limited range detracts from its deterrent effect. It will be required to refuel on missions, thus making it vulnerable as the tanker aircraft are not stealthy. Nevertheless, when fitted with hypersonic missiles it will constitute a significant deterrent to adversaries seeking to encroach into our northern maritime approaches, as will the P8-Poseidon aircraft.
The army helicopter saga and the issues with the submarine project warrant a shake-up in the Defence Department, which has been clumsy, unresponsive and arcane for too long. It has been subjected to numerous reviews, none of which seems to have improved the agility or transparency of its operation. In an era of dramatically reduced warning times and rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific, our elected leaders must demand that the bureaucracy delivers value for the enormous amounts being spent on protecting the nation. Ms Reynolds is now secure in her portfolio and is supported by an exceptional assistant minister in Andrew Hastie, who has had recent experience fighting wars at the end of this supply chain. Now is the time for our force structure to be brought into alignment with our strategic rhetoric. That requires political action. Urgently.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Biden era launched with patriotic appeal for unity	The Australian	The new administration needs to govern from the centre
After a polarising campaign, US president-elect Joe Biden struck the right tone in his victory speech on Sunday Australian time when he appealed for an end to “this grim era of demonisation”. It is time to put away the harsh rhetoric, he said, and lower the temperature. Reaching out to 70 million Americans who voted for President Trump, Mr Biden said he understood the disappointment. “I’ve lost a couple of elections myself. But now, let’s give each other a chance … This is the time to heal in America.” Most election winners promise the same. But it is vital for the US and the world that Mr Biden, after he is sworn in as the 46th US president at the age of 78, makes good his rhetoric. Mr Trump, angry and bitterly disappointed at being rejected by voters for the second term he desperately wanted, must also play his part in calming his supporters.
Amid the fissures that have opened up in American society, and the ravages wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Biden, for all his displays of optimism, has reason to feel daunted. On Friday, 127,000 new COVID-19 infections were diagnosed across the US — the third consecutive day of record numbers, outstripping those recorded in the first wave earlier in the year. Mr Biden and Senator Kamala Harris, the first woman and the first person of colour to occupy the office of vice president, will be sworn in on January 21. But Mr Biden was wise to move quickly to announce the appointment of a group of scientific experts to work on a plan to defeat the virus. Success or failure against the pandemic will do much to define his presidency. The US, like most of Europe, is heading into the northern hemisphere winter in bad shape.
Mr Trump paid a high price for his refusal to heed scientific advice on the virus. But Mr Biden should not give in to demands for a wholesale lockdown that would cripple the economy. Much depends on getting the balance right. The US economy has been bouncing back, growing by a record 33 per cent last quarter. A jobs report last week showed unemployment had fallen to 6.9 per cent, with 638,000 jobs added in October. But if the virus cannot be reined in its effects could trigger a double-dip recession or even a depression with grave repercussions. Individual enterprise needs to remain the American way. Mr Biden would best serve the interests of the US by resisting any push from the left of his own party for a major ideological lurch on issues such as legislating for “equal outcomes” (one of Senator Harris’s interests) or defunding police. The Republican Senate majority should help Mr Biden resist such impulses.
Daunting foreign policy challenges also await. Mr Biden needs to project firm and clear objectives to discourage opportunism by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. In congratulating Mr Biden, Scott Morrison reminded him of the strategic importance of the US-Australia alliance as the bedrock of Washington’s and our own role in the Indo-Pacific region. Mr Morrison will be inviting Mr Biden and his wife, Dr Jill Biden, to the 70th anniversary celebrations of the ANZUS Treaty next year. As Barack Obama’s vice president for eight years, Mr Biden knows the importance of the US pivot to this region at a tense time, mainly caused by China’s unrelenting belligerence. Mr Trump built on the pivot and Mr Biden must further it. A resolute assertion of US commitment to the region is needed from the new administration, including an acknowledgment of the importance of freedom of navigation through the South China Sea.
Mr Biden needs to be similarly decisive in building on Mr Trump’s progress in the Middle East, where US-brokered treaties between Israel and moderate Arab states have improved prospects of peace. Whatever his involvement in the Obama administration’s shortsighted nuclear deal with Iran, Mr Biden would be unwise to recommit to it in the same terms, despite its support among European leaders. While many EU leaders would have breathed a sigh of relief following Mr Trump’s defeat, Mr Biden needs to hold them to their new commitments, bludgeoned out of them by Mr Trump, to bear a larger share of NATO’s defence of Europe. Their contributions are needed to deter incipient Russian aggression.
Mr Biden has made clear his determination to reverse Mr Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement on climate change, and the World Health Organisation. Australia, as Mr Morrison pointed out on Sunday, has remained committed to both, despite being a close US ally. It will be to the world’s advantage if Washington plays a constructive role in such forums, especially, in ensuring the WHO does better in dealing with the COVID. For all Mr Trump’s considerable achievements, grace was not one of his characteristics in the Oval Office or on social media, especially. But he needs to show it now. He is entitled to launch whatever legal action he deems fit to challenge what he regards as examples of fraud to challenge Mr Biden’s victory. But with even his close political allies insisting that nothing verifiable or of major significance has emerged, Mr Trump should be careful about where his disappointment is leading him. Americans do not like sore losers; for his own sake and that of the US and his supporters he should consider why it is important not to undermine his legacy, which in many ways will continue to shape the direction of the US for a long time. After the uncertainty of Mr Trump’s presidency, Mr Biden’s victory has been welcomed in the US and around the world as an opportunity for a return to “normalcy”. For all the upheavals surrounding the result, the process is also testimony to the strength of US democracy. Despite losing, Mr Trump gained seven million more votes than when he defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. Mr Biden got more than 75 million, a record in any presidential election. Such record engagement is a healthy sign of the US’s 244-year old democracy. Given the sharp electoral divide, if Mr Biden is to make good his promises to “restore the soul’’ of the US and unite blue and red states, he will govern from the sensible centre.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Biden era launched with patriotic appeal for unity	The Australian	The new administration needs to govern from the centre After a polarising campaign, US president-elect Joe Biden struck the right tone in his victory speech on Sunday Australian time when he appealed for an end to “this grim era of demonisation”. It is time to put away the harsh rhetoric, he said, and lower the temperature. Reaching out to 70 million Americans who voted for President Trump, Mr Biden said he understood the disappointment. “I’ve lost a couple times myself. But now, let’s give each other a chance … This is the time to heal in America.” Most election winners promise the same. But it is vital for the US and the world that Mr Biden, after he is sworn in as the 46th US president at the age of 78, makes good his rhetoric. Mr Trump, angry and bitterly disappointed at being rejected by voters for the second term he desperately wanted, must also play his part in calming his supporters.
Amid the fissures that have opened up in American society, and the ravages wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Biden, for all his displays of optimism, has reason to feel daunted. On Friday, 127,000 new COVID-19 infections were diagnosed across the US — the third consecutive day of record numbers, outstripping those recorded in the first wave earlier in the year. Mr Biden and Senator Kamala Harris, the first woman and the first person of colour to occupy the office of vice president, will be sworn in on January 21. But Mr Biden was wise to move quickly to announce the appointment of a group of scientific experts to work on a plan to defeat the virus. Success or failure against the pandemic will do much to define his presidency. The US, like most of Europe, is heading into the northern hemisphere winter in bad shape.
Mr Trump paid a high price for his refusal to heed scientific advice on the virus. But Mr Biden should not give in to demands for a wholesale lockdown that would cripple the economy. Much depends on getting the balance right. The US economy has been bouncing back, growing by a record 33 per cent last quarter. A jobs report last week showed unemployment had fallen to 6.9 per cent, with 638,000 jobs added in October. But if the virus cannot be reined in its effects could trigger a double-dip recession or even a depression with grave repercussions. Individual enterprise needs to remain the American way. Mr Biden would best serve the interests of the US by resisting any push from the left of his own party for a major ideological lurch on issues such as legislating for “equal outcomes” (one of Senator Harris’s interests) or defunding police. The Republican Senate majority should help Mr Biden resist such impulses.
Daunting foreign policy challenges also await. Mr Biden needs to project firm and clear objectives to discourage opportunism by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. In congratulating Mr Biden, Scott Morrison reminded him of the strategic importance of the US-Australia alliance as the bedrock of Washington’s and our own role in the Indo-Pacific region. Mr Morrison will be inviting Mr Biden and his wife, Dr Jill Biden, to the 70th anniversary celebrations of the ANZUS Treaty next year. As Barack Obama’s vice president for eight years, Mr Biden knows the importance of the US pivot to this region at a tense time, mainly caused by China’s unrelenting belligerence. Mr Trump built on the pivot and Mr Biden must further it. A resolute assertion of US commitment to the region is needed from the new administration, including an acknowledgment of the importance of freedom of navigation through the South China Sea.
Mr Biden needs to be similarly decisive in building on Mr Trump’s progress in the Middle East, where US-brokered treaties between Israel and moderate Arab states have improved prospects of peace. Whatever his involvement in the Obama administration’s shortsighted nuclear deal with Iran, Mr Biden would be unwise to recommit to it in the same terms, despite its support among European leaders.

Post-Covid strength has come with a high price tag	The Australian	The new debt burden will make it harder to respond to future crises The nation’s post-COVID economic recovery is strengthening, judging by new consumer price index data. In the December quarter, the CPI grew by 0.9 per cent, exceeding market expectations. Rising childcare expenses as parents returned to work, increases in private health insurance premiums and a higher tobacco excise drove the increase. And the figures show that Australians spent up on furnishings, household equipment and services, shaking off the shackles of recession. At this stage of the economic cycle, moderate price rises are a healthy sign. The economy appears to be well short of the need for an interest rate rise to contain inflation and avoid the buoyant property market overheating. The Reserve Bank board may expand on that next week.
Employment figures, due on Thursday, will give a fresh snapshot of the jobs market after unemployment fell to 6.6 per cent last month. The International Monetary Fund has confirmed Australia’s strong position. Its latest update forecasts our economy to grow by 3.5 per cent this year, 0.5 per cent faster than predicted in October, and by 2.9 per cent next year.
While we are significantly better off than comparable nations, Australians should be under no illusions. Our comfortable position has come at a high price. That price has been quantified in an aptly named report called The Looming Iceberg: Australia’s Post-Pandemic Debt Risk, by former senior NSW Treasury official Robert Carling for the Centre for Independent Studies. The report shows federal and state government debts will more than double to $1.75 trillion across the five years to 2024, seriously weakening public finances and paving the way for further credit downgrades. As a consequence, economics editor Adam Creighton writes, Australia’s exceptionalism — our fortunate position as one of the least publicly indebted nations — is over. The increased debt burden, the report says, “poses a risk to economic growth in the longer term and reduces fiscal flexibility and the capacity to respond to future crises”.
The largest increase in net debt was in Victoria. NSW, while in a stronger position, recorded the second-largest increase, “which will transform its fiscal position from one of outstanding strength in recent years to one that is more in line with the average of the states”. The assumption that debt burdens will be manageable in the long term needs to be heavily qualified, the report argues. A steep decline in the debt burden like that achieved after World War II will depend on vigorous economic growth, continuing very low interest rates and fiscal discipline on the part of governments. As Mr Carling notes, public debt was rising even before COVID struck a year ago. Federal and state stimulus measures saved livelihoods and kept countless families out of poverty through the pandemic. Much of the increase in debt was unavoidable. But as the report says, reversing it should be a policy priority once the underlying causes of the rise have passed. Taxpayers are not a bottomless pit. The tourism sector is pushing for a limited extension of JobKeeper beyond March 28 to compensate for the ongoing loss of international visitors. As we reported last week, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have made it clear that the government does not intend to extend the $90bn wage subsidy program. But Tourism Minister Dan Tehan has opened the door to targeted support for tourism businesses, asking the sector to justify any further assistance. In the medium term, vaccines and the new 15-minute finger prick COVID tests should help restart overseas travel.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Maori wards are only fair FROM THE EDITOR	The Daily Post	The news Taupo District Council is introducing Maori wards ahead of the 2022 elections should be welcomed.
The motion to establish the ward passed 7-3 at a council meeting last week and even two of the councillors who voted against the motion totally supported the idea of Maori wards but felt the timing was wrong.
The move would guarantee Maori representation on the council but could be challenged via a public-initiated petition.
In my view, a petition to challenge the decision to establish Maori wards would be narrow-minded.
The Treaty of Waitangi requires us to give effect to the notion of partnership, and without adequate representation across a number of different forums and entities, there can be no partnership. Maori also own a large proportion of the land area of the district but are under-represented in relation to that.
The argument you most often hear against Maori wards is that: “Maori have got to be like the rest of us and stand for election“.
The problem is that’s not working. Yes, there are Maori on council and have been in the 20 years I have been covering council. But at only one or two councillors at a time, the number is woefully low. Maori do stand for council and candidates in recent years have been both skilful and well-respected in their communities, but Maori turnout in local body elections is historically low. As one person said to me: “Maori do not vote”. Part of the reason is that they do not see local government as relevant to them. Having Maori wards would go some way to addressing that.
The common narrative from those opposed to Maori wards, that “we are one people” is, in my view, also misguided. We are many different people and together we make up one district. Our willingness to acknowledge that diversity and work together for the benefit of all, is what makes us strong.
The Taupo District Council is relatively undiverse compared to its neighbour Rotorua. We have nobody under 40, and only two Maori councillors, Tangonui Kingi and Kirsty Trueman.
One third of the Taupo district population is Maori, according to Stats NZ. Yet there has been no guaranteed representation on the council for tangata whenua. The council had the chance to fix that and they grasped it, despite fears around the timing.
This decision can be overturned by a public poll on the matter. In my view, this would be a step back. A council should represent its people. Creating Maori wards would go some way towards ensuring the Taupo District Council does just that.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL We’ll get through this together	The Daily Post	The news was hardly unexpected, but still, it hit like a hammer blow. Lockdown. Businesses to close. Schools to shut. Stay home. Stay away from others. Stay calm.
Staying calm was by far the hardest part. My first impulse was to rush to the supermarket and stock up. I didn’t. I did rush to Mitre 10 Mega and stock up on rabbit food for the kids’ pet bunnies though, figuring (and a staff member confirmed) that it wouldn’t be open to the public from Thursday. I have faith that if we all chill out and people refrain from taking more than their fair share, the supermarket will still be open when I need it.
From my office window, for the last week I watched the cars circling around the Pak’n’Save carpark. When I did finally venture in for my weekly shop it was better than I expected but there were still some things I just couldn’t get at that time — washing powder and pasta spirals. And the toilet paper aisle was a log jam. That was last Thursday evening. But reports were that it had been much worse a few days prior. The people who rushed in and cleared out all the tinned food, rice and pasta should be feeling pretty smug right about now. I get that many people have large families and mouths to feed. But for those who don’t, and stocked up just because they could, their smugness comes at a cost. I spoke to two people from local foodbanks last week — and it’s been reported from other areas too — that people on lower incomes who don’t have the ready money to do a big shopping trip to the supermarket have been missing out on the basics for their families because others have come in and cleared out all the bread, cheese and frozen vegetables and snapped up the budget and home brand items. I applaud supermarket owners for introducing buying restrictions on the hot-button items, to prevent people taking more than their share.
I’m get it. I’m scared. My kids are scared. But scared is not the same as freaking out. We are taking it seriously. There seem to be a few people who aren’t, like those posting idiotic messages on social media along the lines of ‘this is all fuelled by the media to make you panic’. Ignore them. Nobody wants anybody to panic. But we do need to be informed.
I’ve been working from home since late last week. Like many Kiwis, I wonder whether I’ll be working at all in six months or a year. The word ‘cancelled’ is becoming depressingly familiar, to everyone. I worry about my elderly dad, whose partner has just returned from a visit to Melbourne. I desperately hope he’ll be okay. My two teenagers who have NCEA credits to gain this year — what will they do now school is closed?
I worry about the people who don’t have the resources to buy and stockpile food, even if they wanted to. Those on fixed incomes who live from week to week, or with families, whose jobs in tourism or other industries are on the line. Those who are already sick, or battling cancer, or immuno-suppressed. The new babies and the vulnerable elderly. The healthcare workers who we all expect to march off to work every day and battle on the front lines, the police we are relying on to keep order, the people who will be carrying on working in the supermarkets and the pharmacies and power stations and petrol stations, who pick up our rubbish and generally stop society from imploding.
As we keep hearing ‘these are unprecedented times’. A report by senior writer David Fisher in last week’s New Zealand Herald spoke about a Ministry of Health report on ethical values for a pandemic, published in 2007 but still relevant today. The report aimed to identify values that would speak to New Zealanders in the event of deciding what decisions to make in a pandemic. The report offers this:
■ Minimising harm: not harming others, protecting each other and accepting restrictions on our freedom for the protection of others;
■ Respect/manaakitanga: that each of us matters and should be treated as such; allowing others to make their own decisions; supporting those who make decisions for others, restricting freedom only as is necessary.
■ Fairness: A fair go for all, fair prioritisation when resources are scarce, helping others get their fair share;
■ Neighbourliness/whanaungatanga: being there for family, friends and neighbours, working together to meet needs;
■ Reciprocity: helping where we can, contributing specialist skills, supporting those who carry extra responsibilities for others;
■ Unity/kotahitanga: committing to getting through it together.
Let’s all keep these values in mind as we move through this trying time.
I hope that we’ll look back in future years and talk affectionately about how everyone pulled together and we all got through the Great Covid-19 Pandemic of ‘20. (“And would you believe it, in Australia, there were fist fights in supermarkets over toilet paper!” “No way Grandma, really? Toilet paper? You can’t even eat toilet paper!” “I know, crazy right! But for few weeks there everybody nearly collectively lost their minds”)
So, look after your family. Check in by phone or email or messenger with your friends and neighbours. Call those elderly parents and grandparents. Support those local businesses who remain open. Hang tough. Taupo and Turangi are strong. We can do this. He waka eke noa — we’re all in this together.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Albanese shuffles the deck chairs in bid for ALP unity	The Australian	The opposition wants to link action on climate to creating new jobs Anthony Albanese tried to spin his frontbench reshuffle on Thursday, claiming it would ensure Australians “get the most out of Labor”. That is only a fraction of the story. It is mainly about silencing growing rumblings about his leadership, papering over divisions about climate change policy and boosting his authority. The Opposition Leader pointedly has swapped the positions of former climate change and energy spokesman Mark Butler, from the party’s Left, with that of former health spokesman Chris Bowen, from the NSW Right. Mr Albanese says Mr Bowen, who served briefly as treasurer in the second Rudd government, will bring an “economic perspective” to the role. This is a pitch to those on Labor’s Right who agree with backbencher Joel Fitzgibbon that the party has spent too much time talking about climate change and not enough about issues important to its traditional base. Mr Fitzgibbon resigned from the opposition frontbench after a blazing row with his leader on the subject in November last year. Mr Fitzgibbon has welcomed the reshuffle, insisting Mr Butler was overenthusiastic in his approach to climate change action. Mr Albanese will be hoping the move placates voters in regional areas. On the left flank, however, where the Greens pose a threat to Labor in inner-city seats, Greens leader Adam Bandt was quick to claim that “Labor is giving up on climate action and is letting Scott Morrison completely off the hook”.
Mr Butler, who had held the shadow portfolio since 2013, was the architect of the uncosted 45 per cent emissions reduction target that damaged Labor at the 2019 election. Mr Bowen, as Treasury spokesman, was responsible for the failed policy on franking credits. It is debatable which one of them lost the party more votes: probably Mr Bowen, who told radio listeners during the campaign that if they disliked the franking credits policy they were “perfectly entitled to vote against us”. Many took him at his word. Perhaps he learnt a big lesson; if not, he will find it hard to take voters with him on climate policy, which is looming as a major challenge for both sides of politics at the next election, be it this year or next.
Labor is arguing the party is in lock-step with the Biden administration and that the Coalition’s policies will leave Australia isolated on the international stage. On Thursday, US President Joe Biden signed orders that oil, gas and coal emissions be cut and energy production from offshore wind turbines doubled, citing the “existential” climate crisis. Addressing it would create jobs, he said. The Coalition, which won the debate over Labor hands down in 2019, will rubbish claims from Labor or conference participants in Glasgow that Australia is not doing enough on climate. It will point out that Australia deployed renewables 10 times faster than the global average from 2005 to 2018. Scott Morrison also will be quick to again debunk any uncosted Labor polices.
At his press conference on Thursday, Mr Albanese likened himself to Mr Biden: “A bloke who was a former deputy leader and an experienced politician who had held a wide range of portfolios and who was someone who was underestimated by some — he is now President of the United States, and I will be the leader of this country after the next election.” It was a bold claim. Mr Biden, however, had built a consistent lead in the polls against Donald Trump before the US presidential election last November. Polls are never the whole story. But Mr Albanese’s rivals will be watching how he and the party fare in polls in coming days. His leadership is under pressure and the reshuffle was brought forward from the end of the week after news of Mr Butler’s move leaked on Wednesday.
As with any reshuffle, there were winners and losers. Potential leadership rival Tanya Plibersek, who set out her vision for the nation post-COVID on these pages this week, kept her shadow education portfolio and has been given responsibility for women. But she lost oversight of skills to deputy leader Richard Marles. Indeed, Mr Marles was the major winner. He moves from defence to a key economic role as spokesman for employment, small business and science. Or as Mr Albanese put it, “jobs and more jobs”. But Labor should not forget governments do not create jobs. They create conditions that encourage businesses to invest in new staff. Mr Albanese wants to restore unity in the ranks ahead of parliament. Doing so would make the opposition more competitive and effective in holding the government to account in the interests of the nation. Shuffling the deck chairs is not enough, however, if Labor does not overhaul its policies. Nor is it enough, necessarily, to dampen leadership speculation, even though changes made by Kevin Rudd make it harder for the party to change leaders.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Ignoring WHO was a good call	The Australian	The organisation has shown it is an apologist for China
The reported willingness of the Chinese Communist Party to allow “a review by the World Health Organisation’’ into the origins of COVID-19 “at an appropriate time” does not appear to amount to much of a concession. After the WHO’s botched handling of the pandemic, any inquiry it ran would be unlikely to provide the independent, scrutiny Scott Morrison has called for.
Beginning with his fawning praise of China’s “transparency” after meeting President Xi Jinping in Beijing in January, the WHO’s Ethiopian director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has been consistently wrong. With cases exceeding four million worldwide, with 280,443 deaths, and the global economy on its knees, Dr Tedros’s assertion after meeting Mr Xi that “China’s actions actually helped prevent the spread of coronavirus to other countries” was absurd. Likewise his admonition of Australia when, amid protests from Beijing, we closed our border to Chinese flights from February 1. That, Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Sunday, was perhaps our most important decision throughout the entire course of the virus, and one of the most important by an Australian government in decades. Dr Tedros, as Beijing’s apologist, said at the time that Australia’s action was “likely to cause more harm than good”. The WHO’s willingness to do the CCP’s bidding has been evident in relation to Taiwan, which has had only 440 cases and six deaths. Taiwan was the first to suspect COVID-19 could be transmitted from human to human and reported that to the WHO in December. Its early warning was ignored, with dire results.The Prime Minister’s push for an inquiry is gaining momentum ahead of the World Health Assembly, a virtual gathering of the WHO’s 194 members, on May 18. The EU, in consultation with Australia, has drafted a resolution calling for an evaluation of lessons learned from the world’s response to COVID-19. China, reportedly, is taking part in discussions about a final draft. Whatever form the resolution takes, it must not let China escape scrutiny. A whitewash is not what the world needs. As Trade Minister Simon Birmingham says, reports that China will slap tariffs on Australian barley following Mr Morrison’s call are deeply concerning.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
High price for telling the truth	The Australian	The origins of COVID in Wuhan have been shrouded deliberately The sentencing by a Shanghai court of Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan to four years’ imprisonment highlights the communist regime’s determination to snuff discussion about COVID-19’s origins. The ruthless sentence also shows the challenge facing a 10-member World Health Organisation scientific team that is due to travel to Wuhan next month to finally give effect to the World Health Assembly’s unanimous backing in May of Australia’s sensible call for a full investigation into the start and spread of the pandemic. As Scott Morrison has pointed out, China, no less than the rest of the world, stands to benefit from an independent scientific investigation into COVID-19’s origins to help prevent future pandemics.
On Monday, Ms Zhang, a 37-year-old former lawyer who from February 1 spent three months in Wuhan recording more than 120 video clips on the outbreak and the regime’s response, was charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. That is Chinese Communist Party claptrap to silence dissenters and consign them to jail.
Ms Zhang visited hospitals and crematoriums, interviewed frightened Wuhan locals, posted the videos on YouTube and shared her unique insights with foreign reporters. Her fearless accounts came as Beijing’s spin doctors were trying to persuade the world that President Xi Jinping was leading a heroic response that was effectively and transparently dealing with the pandemic. The reality, events showed, was different. And Ms Zhang’s videos did much to unmask the CCP’s brazen dishonesty. Her reporting alarmed Chinese authorities. In December last year, eight doctors in Wuhan who expressed concern about the virus were severely reprimanded. Mr Xi is believed to have known of human transmission in early January but Beijing remained silent until January 20, setting back the world’s response by vital weeks.
Ms Zhang went missing in mid-May. She eventually was found in prison. She went on a hunger strike but was force fed. She appeared in court on Monday in a wheelchair. Lawyers said she recited the Bible for comfort and “feels psychologically exhausted”. She and other citizen journalists deserve universal gratitude, not incarceration in a fetid Chinese prison. Unsurprisingly, roadblocks aplenty have been put in the way of getting the WHO’s scientific team to Wuhan. Now that the investigation is set to go it must pay close attention to the fearless reporting of Ms Zhang and those like her who witnessed and helped expose the CCP’s shameless deceit.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
WHO whitewash leaves the world in darkness on Covid	The Australian	The origins of the virus must be uncovered to avoid fresh pandemics
It would be hard to view the report by World Health Organisation investigators into the origins of COVID-19 as anything other than an outrageous whitewash that has found exactly what Beijing has been trying to get the world to believe about the start of the pandemic. The report’s barefaced conclusion that it is “extremely unlikely” the virus emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, just because Chinese scientists say so, beggars belief. But it is no surprise given the cosy relationship between China and the WHO.
Peter Ben Embarek, the Danish food safety expert leading the WHO team, said the group was fully satisfied with answers about the institute’s safety. Conveniently for China, the team did not recommend further investigation into possible links to the laboratory. “They (the institute’s scientists) are the best ones to dismiss the claims and provide answers to all questions,” Dr Embarek said.
But as Stanford University microbiologist David Relman pointed out: “If the only information you’re allowing to be weighed is provided by the very people who have everything to lose by revealing such evidence, that just doesn’t come close to passing the sniff test.” He is right, especially in light of WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’s lavish praise of China in a meeting with President Xi Jinping at the start of the crisis in January last year. After a WHO team travelled to China the following month and also praised its response to the pandemic, it was clear that the WHO, under Dr Tedros, was in China’s pocket.
One of the most bizarre features of the report was the WHO team’s decision to leave open the possibility that the virus might have been transmitted to humans through frozen food. That kooky theory was pedalled by the Chinese Communist Party, which claimed the virus could not possibly have originated in China but was most likely brought in from elsewhere through frozen animal products. At Tuesday’s presentation of the investigators’ report following their 12-day visit to Wuhan, Liang Wannian, representing China, claimed the virus was present elsewhere before it was found in Wuhan in December 2019. “Studies from different countries suggest that (the virus) was circulating preceding the initial detection of cases by several weeks,” he said. Dr Liang insisted that no laboratory in Wuhan had done work with the SARS-CoV-2 strain, as the novel coronavirus is officially known, but on the virus’s distant relatives. He said the likelihood was that it jumped across species in nature through intermediary hosts such as pangolins, cats or minks. Dr Embarek agreed it was “most likely” that the virus evolved in nature and spread to humans through such intermediary hosts.
But the overall conclusion of the WHO investigators was that they had failed to identify the original source of the pandemic and were no closer to solving the mystery of its origins. That could hardly be more disappointing for a world devastated by a virus that has had 107 million known cases, causing 2.3 million deaths.
The report does demonstrate, however, the absurdity of the CCP’s vehement over-reaction to Scott Morrison’s prudent call in April last year for a full investigation into the provenance of the pandemic. As the Prime Minister said at the time, it was in the interests of the entire world that a full investigation be started without delay. Despite Mr Xi’s hostility, the entire world, including even China, albeit reluctantly, eventually agreed with Mr Morrison at the World Health Assembly in May. But because of deliberate Chinese obstruction, it took until last month to get the team into Wuhan. The disappointing report reflects poorly on the WHO’s willingness to get to the bottom of the pandemic. But it leaves no doubt about the importance of getting to the bottom of what spawned COVID-19.
Given the way China, at the start of the outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019, did its best to scrub all evidence of the pandemic’s genesis, it was never going to be easy for any investigative team to establish the truth. Last Sunday was the first anniversary of the death of courageous Wuhan ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who tried to warn colleagues about the virus. Chinese authorities treated him brutally, and his fate sums up all that has been shameful about Beijing’s self-serving response to the crisis. Regardless of China’s determination not to open up, the WHO team’s inadequate effort must not be the end of attempts to establish the truth, which is vital to help avoid future pandemics. Having failed to get any real answers, the world must not give up on hopes for a more rigorous investigation.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Economic rebound boosts business, job opportunities	The Australian	The pace of recovery negates the need for extra taxpayer support
The surge in job vacancies in November, including in sectors hardest hit by the COVID recession, shows the strength of the economic recovery. It is a good reason for the Morrison government to resist calls for support programs such as JobKeeper to be extended beyond March. Further stimulus would add to borrowings and debt, or delay the repayment of both, at the expense of this and future generations of taxpayers. Barring unexpected emergencies that demand government stimulus to protect GDP and jobs, businesses are increasingly well placed to stand on their own resources. In the main, they are doing so well and are creating jobs. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show job vacancies over the three months to November surged to a record 254,000. Around one in six firms was struggling to find enough staff, the ABS December business survey showed. Job vacancies had surpassed pre-pandemic levels in February last year and were 12 per cent higher than in late 2019, Patrick Commins reports on Thursday. The industries with the largest increases in vacancies — retail trade, accommodation and food services — had all suffered large falls in May, at the peak of COVID-related restrictions.
On Wednesday, hospitality and tourism industry leaders urged Josh Frydenberg to relax JobKeeper eligibility rules for hospitality and tourism businesses. These had begun to recover, the sector argued, only to be decimated when snap lockdowns were imposed in Sydney and Brisbane over the lucrative Christmas period. Times remain unnecessarily tough for many businesses, largely because capricious border closures by state leaders are disrupting economic activity and Australians’ travel plans.
Something has gone very wrong in the Stasi-like approach to borders, especially on the part of Western Australia and Victoria. These, in turn, affect the rest of the nation. They have created a situation in which the fear of being caught out by sudden border closures is now more of an impediment to domestic travel than the fear of catching COVID-19, aviation writer Robyn Ironside reported this week. That devastating blow for tourism operators needs to be rectified, not through extra stimulus but by more realistic and pragmatic policies on the part of state leaders. In its eagerness on Wednesday to defend Premier Mark McGowan’s “island within an island” approach to hard border lockdowns and suggest The Australian does not understand, the West Australian newspaper overlooked the debilitating effect of irrational border restrictions on all states, including its own. We understand them all too well, as do travellers and businesses.
In recounting the exasperating, exhausting and costly experience of Melbourne couple Nathan and Jennifer Costin and their three young children, Rachel Baxendale exposes the economic and human costs wrought by Victoria’s go-slow “traffic light’’ permits. That sclerotic system will deter Victorians from travelling and convince other Australians to stay out of the state. It is undermining national unity and personal freedom, without taking us any closer to suppressing COVID-19.
The JobKeeper wage subsidy and JobSeeker coronavirus supplement are due to expire at the end of March. They have fulfilled their purposes well, albeit at vast expense to current and future taxpayers. But it is time to wind back the largesse. Direct fiscal support is forecast to fall from 6.9 per cent of nominal GDP in 2020-21, to 2.4 per cent in 2021-22, as it must. But as support measures are withdrawn, Treasury modelling shows households and businesses have saved $200bn in cash through the pandemic. This will help avoid the economy falling off a fiscal cliff. The nation is in a fortunate position, with the household savings ratio higher now than it was leading into the pandemic. The Treasury analysis shows direct fiscal support will add 5 per cent to real GDP in 2020-21, and another 4.5 per cent in 2021-22, despite a drop of almost $90bn in government support between the two financial years. Morgan Stanley head of Australian economics Chris Nicol is correct when he says job security will be key in whether consumers are prepared to draw down on their savings this year. At this stage, there is no justification for adding to the budget deficit of $197.7bn or to gross debt that will reach $1 trillion later in the decade. Nor is there any justification for WA and Victoria throttling recovery with border regimes that serve no useful purpose.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Learning fast lessons saves lives in coronavirus battle	The Australian	The pandemic has exposed serious weaknesses in aged care It cannot be happening again — surely? It might be. Victoria’s second wave of COVID-19, sparked largely by security bungles at quarantine hotels Rydges on Swanston and the Stamford Plaza in Melbourne in May and early June, has cost 219 lives since July 5. That includes a record daily toll of 19 deaths reported on Monday, a spike that took the national coronavirus toll past 300. Victoria has 7869 active cases of the virus and the state’s current lockdowns are costing the national economy about $12bn, 400,000 jobs and incalculable personal hardships.
The Andrews government, to its shame, does not appear to have learned the lessons of the hotel debacle, which is now the subject of an inquiry headed by retired judge Jennifer Coate. On its opening day, senior counsel assisting, Tony Neal QC, said “it might even be that every case of COVID-19 in Victoria in recent weeks could be sourced to the hotel quarantine program”. Against that background, on Tuesday’s front page Victorian editor Damon Johnston reveals that two more COVID-19 hotels in Melbourne — the Brady and the Grand Chancellor — are beset with big problems involving security, infection control and tensions between medical staff, police and Victorian Department of Health and Human Services officials.
On the day the world officially passed 20 million COVID infections, including five million in the US, the bright spot in Victoria was that new cases totalled 322, the lowest increase for weeks. If the state is at a crossroads, neither the Andrews government nor any other state or territory or Canberra can afford to ignore the hard lessons of past mistakes. Such lessons abound, unfortunately, not only within Victoria’s hotel quarantine programs but also in the problematic, resource-strapped aged-care sector, whose frail residents and their anxious families have borne much of the loss and emotional brunt of the pandemic.
Lessons should have been learned early in phase one of the coronavirus outbreak at Anglicare’s Newmarch House nursing home near Penrith in Sydney’s west. There, 19 residents died after contracting the virus while in care. On Monday, the aged-care royal commission heard that NSW Health Department officials were concerned about setting a precedent if they transferred all COVID-positive nursing home residents for treatment. As Stephen Lunn reports, commonwealth and state officials were sharply at odds about how to treat Newmarch House residents who contracted the virus in the early days of the cluster.
In hindsight, mistakes across the sector have been legion. Little was done to prevent disaster being repeated at more than 100 nursing homes in Victoria, in which 1000 residents have been diagnosed with COVID and 168 people have died. The toll was a “human tragedy”, counsel assisting the aged-care commission Peter Rozen QC said. His description of the virus as “the greatest challenge the Australian aged-care sector has ever faced” is correct.
Problems aired before the commission included the fact neither the federal Department of Health nor the aged-care regulator developed a COVID-19 plan for the sector. That was despite the fact from the outset it was recognised that recipients of aged-care services were a high-risk group. Nor did the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the joint state-federal body that is the main source of advice about COVID-19, have any advice for the sector about coronavirus between June 19 and August 3. During that crucial six weeks, Mr Rozen said, the number of new daily infections in Victoria grew from 25 to 413. No advice was provided, for example, Mr Rozen said, about how the sector should respond to the risk posed by aged-care workers who might be COVID-19 positive yet asymptomatic, especially those working in multiple facilities. In a sector that relies on part-time and casual staff, such workers were always likely to be infection carriers.
The aged-care royal commission, its recommendations and their implementation will be a lengthy process and far broader than the COVID-19 crisis. Immediate lessons about the sector’s main shortcomings in managing coronavirus, however, need to be taken on board. If heartbreaking scenes such as those at Newmarch House and St Basil’s Greek Orthodox home for the aged at Fawkner, in Melbourne’s north, are to be avoided, health authorities and the sector need to prepare for the possibility of future outbreaks. Evidence to a Senate committee scrutinising the Morrison government’s response to the pandemic shows the aged-care watchdog knew there had been an outbreak at St Basil’s but took four days to inform the Health Department. Coronavirus protocols, which stipulate aged-care homes must notify federal authorities, as well as the state public health unit, within 30 minutes of learning of an infection, should always be followed. With Australia’s COVID toll increasing by more than 100 in less than 10 days, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd has warned more people will die because of COVID’s “devastating effect” on aged-care facilities. Current problems in Melbourne’s quarantine hotels also will erode public confidence. An infected guest refusing to stay in her room, hotel staff at risk of infection and understandably anxious, and close contacts between infected guests are a potentially lethal mix. Until mistakes are avoided, ongoing COVID-19 waves remain a serious risk.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Christmas week to make or break Sydney’s Covid crisis	The Australian	The pandemic is wreaking havoc on festivities and sporting events After recording 30 new coronavirus cases overnight, bringing the known total of the northern beaches outbreak to 70 on Sunday, NSW authorities are treading a fine line. On one hand, precautions have been strengthened. On the other, the Berejiklian government is doing as much as possible to avoid the kind of debilitating lockdown that could bring about tens of thousands of job losses and trigger serious mental health problems among the community. Sydneysiders in the northern beaches have responded well, with few exceptions — staying home and keeping their distance from each other, which is the best way to avoid harsher measures being made compulsory. There is no room for complacency, as Scott Morrison has reminded the nation. A quick glance at Londoners facing an austere and, in many cases, a lonely Christmas, like no other since World War II, underlines what is at stake.
The concern of other state and territory leaders about the movement of people to and from Sydney, especially the northern beaches, is understandable. But the hectoring and lecturing by West Australian Premier Mark McGowan is distasteful and disgraceful. Fast to slam down a hard border against NSW in its entirety on Friday — when most of the state was and is unaffected by the cluster — Mr McGowan’s state jingoism in pursuit of extra votes in March is bad leadership. His ridiculously narrow approach is not in the economic or social interests of West Australians, NSW or the nation.
Mr McGowan’s unsolicited advice to Gladys Berejiklian is simplistic and puerile — “They seem to be engaging in a form of whack-a-mole, they try and step on a gym here or a restaurant there. Rather than playing whack-a-mole, they need to kill all the moles.” Likewise, WA Health Minister Roger Cook’s telling Ms Berejiklian to “look at the scoreboard … we’re 0/252 (the number of days in WA without community transmission)’’. But it’s not clear how Mr Cook will police his diktat that NSW guests cannot sit at the Christmas lunch table or open presents in WA homes. Bread and water in the backyard for them, presumably.
Such parochial reactions to a potential crisis in our largest state raise serious questions about WA’s attitude towards our federation and national unity. Rather than pandering to Mr McGowan with banner headlines such as “New South Fails’’ on Saturday, the West Australian newspaper should hold him to account. Other states have taken a more reasonable approach, differentiating, at this stage, between Greater Sydney and the rest of NSW.
Northern beaches residents have responded well to the Berejiklian government’s call to stay home as much as possible, wear masks and be tested for COVID, with many people waiting five or six hours in queues to be tested on Sunday. But as UNSW epidemiologist Raina MacIntyre said, the testing capacity needs to be easier and more accessible.
Ms Berejiklian has adopted a more liberal approach to the compulsory, authoritarian regime imposed early in Melbourne’s second wave. Home gatherings in Sydney have been limited to no more than 10 visitors. Singing indoors is not allowed and no more than 20 people can dance at weddings. As is often the case, managing the pandemic involves a trade-off between the conflicting advice of health experts and the concerns of business over jobs and viability of firms. National employer association Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox is alarmed at the interstate travel bans he regards as a knee-jerk reaction. The lack of trust between states and their contact tracing and testing systems is destabilising, as Mr Willox said. State borders closing at the first sign of new outbreaks would undermine investment, jobs and confidence just as economic recovery was taking hold.
At the same time, as experience in Britain and Italy shows, nothing wreaks havoc on people and economic activity as quickly and severely as a runaway COVID outbreak. Professor MacIntyre wants an immediate lockdown across Greater Sydney if the infection rate is not down on Monday. She told Stephen Rice New Year’s Eve is likely to be “ the mother of all super-spreading events … a disaster waiting to happen”. The biggest danger, she said, was that large numbers of people now infectious but asymptomatic would travel across Sydney on Christmas Day and infect others. Many of those people, in turn, would be out partying at the peak of their infectiousness on New Year’s Eve. Ms Berejiklian says it is a positive sign “we still have not seen evidence of massive seeding outside the northern beaches community’’. But a number of popular venues in Sydney’s inner city and inner west have been added to NSW Health’s warning list as authorities track COVID-19’s spread from the northern beaches cluster to potential infection sites on the north shore, inner east, inner west and south. Sydney-siders from all parts of the city are now being told to get tested and self-isolate. A vast contact-tracing effort is under way. Mystery also still surrounds the source of the cluster, with genomic testing suggesting “Patient Zero” is likely from the US. The next day or two will determine whether Ms Berejiklian’s softly-softly, balanced approach is containing a potentially full-blown disaster.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
We owe better to our most vulnerable elderly citizens	The Australian	The pandemic risk to the aged-care sector was foreseeable There is an urgent need to get a better grip on COVID-19 in the aged-care sector. A Monash University expert, Joseph Ibrahim, has told the royal commission into the sector that he believes not enough was done to prepare for this foreseeable risk, with the result that hundreds of residents may die prematurely. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth rejects the suggestion that a lack of urgency led to inaction, but data and anecdotal reports from aged care combine to present an alarming picture. In this newspaper Sharri Markson reported a series of concerns, raising the possibility of unethical treatment of the vulnerable and avoidable deaths. Australia’s COVID mortality began to increase rapidly around 50 days after the first 100 deaths, and aged care and the Victorian outbreaks have been at the heart of this trend. We are now the third- or fourth-worst country in the world for the concentration of COVID deaths in aged care, and this turnaround has been quick. The royal commission has heard that more than 1000 staff in aged care have been infected by the virus, and for many their working lives are full of worry and grief.
The issue is inescapably emotive and its partisan political edge can only be sharpened by the institutional blame-shifting that comes with a royal commission. But the priority must be to keep cool heads, and quickly learn to make better decisions and put them into practice under crisis conditions. Constitutional demarcations of responsibility are artificial in the sense that nothing will improve without more effective co-operation between all levels of government, the sector itself and families with a stake in it. There seems to be credible evidence of the commonwealth falling short in its preparations, but this can’t be separated from the failures on the ground in Victoria by the state government. All those in positions of authority need to shift their focus from brand protection for the moment, and find common cause in a fundamental human truth. The elderly, frail and vulnerable possess inherent dignity and worth as individuals and as cherished members of family and community. We as a society knew months ago that those in aged and residential care would be especially at risk of this virus, and we had a duty to do everything possible to prevent avoidable suffering, death and bereavement. That goal, after all, was a key rationale for the imposition of an unprecedented lockdown with high costs. Did we make the most of this breathing space? Evidence before the royal commission — and out there in the aged-care sector — suggests we did not, although federal Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy insists planning was adequate. It’s true the pandemic hit a sector with multiple problems and therefore not well set up to deal with a crisis. In our culture, many families have decided they cannot — or do not want to — care for aged relatives in their own homes, yet they also have shown discontent with the fees charged by the sector or the taxation levels necessary for more subsidy. And the sector has its own inefficiencies and reform needs.
The result has been an underperforming sector and facilities chronically short of stable workforces and adequately qualified staff. There has long been a push to set minimum staff-to-resident ratios and this may look superficially attractive. The deeper question is where enough suitably trained staff would come from. And it would still be possible to have a poorly run facility with exactly the right number of staff. There will be no quick fix, short of reforming incentives, training and regulation to maximise the likelihood that each facility will have an effective staff profile and a workplace culture of genuine care and seriousness about fixing problems.
The more immediate problems highlighted by Markson’s reporting have to be addressed in far from ideal circumstances with acute staffing problems and terrible dilemmas. The proper and limited use of sedatives and anti-psychotics is a longstanding debate but becomes more fraught when institutions are in crisis mode and families are unable to visit. If a delirious or agitated resident with the virus is an infection risk to others, some medication may be justified. But at what point does it become a convenient chemical restraint for management of an institution, albeit one in crisis? The same goes for so-called advanced care or end-of-life plans. The risk is that these become a rationale for neglect of infected residents who with the right care might well survive the illness. Worse still is the prospect of residents who are infected but not seriously ill ending up on de facto palliative treatment such as morphine. Each case involves ethically challenging decisions about risks and benefits, both for the individual and others in the facility. Likewise consideration of whether to move infected patients out of aged care and into a hospital, something the Victorian government reportedly resists. We don’t seem to have thought these issues through with enough rigour or urgency. It’s a sound principle that a society ought to be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable people.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
McCormack must step up for Nationals to succeed	The Australian	The party faces serious policy challenges on many fronts
Michael McCormack has not set the world on fire since becoming Nationals leader in February 2018. The colleagues who supported a spill of the leadership on Tuesday cited the Deputy Prime Minister’s lack of cut-through and his passivity in pursuing issues that were important for the party’s rural and regional constituency. In his statement of resignation from cabinet to support Barnaby Joyce, Matt Canavan declared “forthright leadership from the Nationals party is needed more than ever”. Still, Mr McCormack prevailed in the partyroom, seeing off the challenge from the “look at me” Mr Joyce, an enduringly ambitious one-man political band. Did we just see boring beat batty, with due respect to both men?
Mr McCormack’s standing, such as it is, was not helped by Scott Morrison’s Hawaiian vacation in December and the obfuscation around the caretaker arrangements that were in place. The Prime Minister and his team decided to hide Mr Morrison’s overseas holiday — a too-clever-by-half mistake — and, like it or not, ended up diminishing both leaders’ authority. It’s true Mr McCormack’s presentation skills do not win over the style markers in Canberra, let alone his internal critics, but his method brings success in the party’s heartland. At last May’s election, the Nationals held all 16 of their lower house electorates, including two seats where incumbent MPs were retiring, seeing off attacks from One Nation and Clive Palmer’s big money politicking.
As well, Mr McCormack operates in the shadow of the Prime Minister, the dominant figure in conservative politics. That Mr McCormack is so close to Mr Morrison is both a bonus and hindrance to the junior Coalition partner; it promotes Coalition unity, for sure, but does not build product differentiation or a national profile, critics say. But Nationals do their best work on the ground, representing distinct rural and regional communities. This was the case last May in Queensland, where all six Nationals MPs secured increased primary votes. What irks the peanut gallery in Canberra — say, support for the Adani coal project or more dams — plays differently in the commodity-rich, coal-dependent Sunshine State.
That an erratic spirit such as Mr Joyce — a magnet for controversy, with a penchant for crossing the floor on key issues and a talent for melodrama in his personal life — was able to gather any support from a standing start does not bode well for Nationals unity. It’s a pity Senator Canavan has been caught up in Mr Joyce’s long-running vanity project. Senator Canavan is energetic, talented and a skilled communicator. He is more effective in the heart of the Morrison government, overseeing policy for northern development and the resources sector, than as a television talking head, op-ed contributor or numbers man for Mr Joyce.
If there is a silver lining for the party in the turmoil, it comes in the elevation of David Littleproud as deputy leader. He has been in parliament since only 2016 and has been on the fast track. Mr Littleproud must get his teeth into a big policy portfolio, come up with solutions to problems, help his leader in the task of messaging and bide his time.
The Nationals face several policy challenges, given the ongoing drought, recovery from bushfires and broader economic weakness. There is pressure to do more on water, dams, drought assistance and baseload power. Adding to this picture will be a likely hit to export sales of agricultural products from the coronavirus crisis, as well as an expected drop in tourists in regional areas due to bushfires and the virus.As we saw from Monday’s Newspoll, the drop in the Coalition’s primary vote is not going to Labor. As Dennis Shanahan writes on Wednesday, support is being lost to “others”, which includes the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers, who are drawing strong support in NSW. Mr McCormack must lift his game, given the core issues and personalities behind Tuesday’s party revolt won’t easily go away. He must re-engage with disaffected voters, such as those who turned on him outside Parliament House in December, due to water, drought and agricultural policy. It’s a delicate task, with a depleted team, in a disruptive, volatile era in politics. The Nationals leader is on notice.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
We say Invention in Covid-19 era can be harsh	The New Zealand Herald	The problem of knocking Covid-19 over and stopping it from getting off the canvas, means authorities are coming up with changes not on the radar months ago.
In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews has introduced a permit system for those Melbourne residents still allowed to work outside the home during lockdown to show to police when people are outside.
The city, Australia’s second largest, is now also under a nightly curfew. And there’s also a hefty new punishment — fines of A$4957 ($5337) in some cases for those breaching coronavirus isolation.
The moves have arisen out of necessity and desperation, as coronavirus cases in the state have remained stubbornly high. A man in his 30s became the youngest person to die from coronavirus in Australia. He was one of 15 people to die on Wednesday in Victoria, and there were 725 cases.
Hundreds of thousands of workers face uncertainty as many businesses are closing for the six-week State of Disaster.
These are highly unusual changes for this part of the world.
But this is what major crises do — they push policymakers further in terms of what is thinkable and acceptable.
New problems demand new ideas that previously would have been slapped down as unpopular, unrealistic and unaffordable. That then widens the collective vision of what can be done and creates new demands.
It is a process where change can happen quickly — for good or bad — with decision-making done without the extensive debate or the inertia of normal times.
For instance, the Australian Federal Government is introducing A$1500 payments to people who have to isolate for 14 days and do not have sick leave. The payment is only available to people in Victoria while it is in the State of Disaster.
The aim is to discourage workers without sick leave from breaking isolation to earn money.
But the Australian Council of Trade Unions says it is only a “good start”. Council president Michele O’Neil told Channel Seven: “We want it to work like sick leave so there’s no disincentive.” And the Labor Party is pushing for the pandemic leave payments to be available across the country.
Under Melbourne’s stage four lockdown, only essential workers and those seeking or providing care are able to leave their homes between 8pm and 5am. During daylight, people can go outside only if it is necessary, and they have to stay within 5km of their homes.
Andrews says the permit system — papers signed by workers and their employers — will apply to private sector businesses where there is not an official identification.
Victoria is not only battling its outbreak, but also clear fatigue with the pandemic.
Infected people caught breaching the rules for a second time will get the A$4957 on-the-spot fine. That could rise to A$20,000 if a case goes to court. An additional 250 police, 500 defence force and 300 health staff will monitor the lockdown.
Complacency is also something worrying officials here, who are clearly watching Victoria closely.
Health Minister Chris Hipkins bluntly warned New Zealanders about maintaining “constant vigilance”.
“We cannot afford for Covid-19 fatigue to set in.”
Director general of health Ashley Bloomfield said this week that one single case outside managed isolation could turn into a wider outbreak. “We have worked too hard to let that happen here.”
There is also a warning for us in the Victorian experience that unpalatable changes can quickly be pushed through in these unusual times.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses

Freedom camp opportunity? EDITORIAL	Bay of Plenty Times	The pros and cons of freedom camping is a conversation that continually rears its head in our communities.
It seems to me that our closed borders has produced winners and losers economically but given us breathing space on the environmental pressures we face.
Kauri dieback would be one example, as is freedom camping.
Are we using this time to think and act differently in preparation for a return of our international visitors? Or are we once again focused on putting out fires?
An international visitor survey by MBIE found the number of international visitors who did some freedom camping in New Zealand has risen from 54,000 in the year ended 2013 to around 123,000 in 2018, rising by 10,000 visitors since the beginning of the 2000s.
Talking to one east coast Coromandel information centre manager, the experience is that those who freedom camp don’t spend. Not even $2 on a walking map: “They think, why would I when I can download it for free on my phone?”
But total estimated spending by visitors who did some freedom camping has risen from $210 million in 2013 to $540m in 2018 according to MBIE’s survey, a similar pattern to that seen for total international visitors.
Germans were nearly three times as likely — 14 per cent of German visitors, or 14,000 per year — to do some freedom camping than any other of the other top visitor markets in 2017 and 2018 followed by the UK with 6 per cent.
Australia contributes the largest number of freedom campers in New Zealand because they’re the largest visitor nationality, at 29 per cent — average 33,000 in 2017 and 2018.
When Thames-Coromandel’s former chief executive David Hammond left his role, he focused on freedom camping and wrote the best practice guide for Local Government New Zealand, and worked with Nelson City Council on a complete new approach to freedom camping management.
He echoes the findings of MBIE that freedom campers spent, on average, around half as much per day ($99) compared with all visitors ($195) — and a lot is on petrol and consumables that don’t necessarily get to communities. The average spend for those who did some freedom camping was $4400 per visitor in 2017 and 2018, as they stayed longer so spent more.
David says if small communities can embrace freedom camping and manage the negative impacts, we stand to gain, since not all tourism can be high-value tourism.
“We know that local markets really work for [freedom campers] but they’re not on every day of the week.”
Guided cultural tourism is an untapped market for freedom campers who save up to spend on an activity and seek cultural experiences, he says.
One organisation focusing on the positives is the RSA, which acts as a “park over property” allowing freedom camping to RSA members and those of NZMCA, and have done for many years and continuously in Whangamata since 2005.
Campervan owners at the RSA don’t rock up in people movers with a bubble wrapped toilet in the boot, they park their $75,000-plus campervan and buy a meal and support local. But ratepayers were tiring of seeing others that did arrive in cars at a quiet beachfront spot like Onemana, where the community plan discourages freedom camping, and have facilities funded for their use.
Keith Hay of the Waihi Beach Ratepayers says the reason for the freedom camping law is long gone and it needs a national solution, and not an ambivalent attitude from local government.
He thinks fellow local Ian Smith’s suggestion to allow it in 100km/h areas but not 50km/h or 70km/h is a good idea.
It’s time we took the lead on what we can offer our visitors while protecting our special places, and how we can match them with the local businesses that stand to gain from their reappearance on our shores.

Anzac travel bubble major step in Covid-19 recovery	The Australian	The prospect of quarantine-free international travel is most welcome Australians have not lost the zest for travel. In anticipation of, and immediately after, Tuesday’s announcement of a quarantine-free two-way bubble with New Zealand, travellers from both countries rushed to book flights and accommodation on both sides of the ditch for family reunions, holidays and business. From April 19, airlines are expecting to carry close to 100,000 people a week between Australia and New Zealand. Qantas and Jetstar will operate 122 services a week on 15 routes, including new routes from Auckland to Cairns and the Gold Coast. Air New Zealand will fly on 19 routes by the end of June.
News of the opening up of our biggest international air route injected a spark to the return to work from the Easter break — a sense that slowly but surely life was on track to return to something like what it was at the start of last year. “This is the first of many more steps to come, I believe, as we get back to a normal, more normal position, not only over the course of this year but beyond,” Scott Morrison said. “And all in time for Anzac Day also, which is tremendous to see that occur in the true Anzac spirit of our two nations coming together again.’’ The practical benefits will be significant and a win-win for both countries: more planes in the air, more jobs on the ground and in the air for hard-pressed airlines. The agreement was a world first, as New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in announcing it. New Zealanders have been welcome in Australia without quarantining since October. But until now they have had to quarantine when they return home. Given the nature of COVID, some interruptions and suspensions are possible.
The development helps put the row over the pace of Australia’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout into perspective. More than 850,000 Australians have had at least one jab. Yes, that is more than three million short of the government’s initial target of four million vaccinations by the end of March. On Monday, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia said the mass rollout had been delayed by at least a month, with pharmacists unlikely to begin distributing vaccines until June. Grattan Institute director Stephen Duckett said GPs’ waiting rooms were too small to have large numbers of people going through. And University of NSW strategic health policy consultant Bill Bowtell has warned the virus is mutating across the world faster than Australia is administering jabs. The death on Monday of a 77-year-old man from Papua New Guinea in intensive care in a Queensland hospital from COVID-19 is a reminder that the virus is lethal.
But with no community transmissions across Australia on Tuesday, and the rollout at GP clinics gathering pace, there is no reason to panic or for governments to mobilise large-scale mass vaccination facilities such as those established in stadiums, town halls and cathedrals in the US and Britain. In those nations, infections and COVID deaths had soared to desperate levels before the rollouts. By Australian standards, the tolls remain high but they are falling rapidly as vaccines take effect.
Community concerns about Australia’s rollout demonstrate why the Morrison government’s most senior ministers must take the nation into their confidence and keep the public updated on vaccine developments. On Monday, some people felt they were in the dark when Acting Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd could not say when the federal regulator would give the green light for all of Australia’s stockpiled jabs or when CSL would reach its production target. The Prime Minister clarified the situation on Tuesday. He said experts would take their time to make sure vaccines were safe. “There is no holdup,” he said. “The release of vaccines has always been based on them completing those processes, so the fact that they actually have to get approved by the relevant authorities and do the batch testing is not a holdup. It is a necessary part of the process to guarantee safety.” As Mr Morrison has explained several times, the target of four million vaccinations by the end of March was not met because 3.1 million vaccines ordered from Europe were not supplied. While the elderly and other vulnerable people were being vaccinated, GP clinics were the best option, he said. In the next phase, when the bulk of the population would be offered jabs, pharmacies would become eligible to distribute them. Mr Morrison will discuss with state leaders at national cabinet on Friday whether vaccination figures should be published more often. The Australian believes they should be. The public is entitled to know the state of play at such a critical stage in the fight against the pandemic. Before Easter, 79,000 vaccines a day were being given. That rate needs to be expanded. It will be, as more GP clinics and, later, pharmacies join the program. Safety and supplies, including of Australian-made AstraZeneca, will be vital.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Ruby Princess scrutiny is vital	The Australian	The public interest must never be treated with contempt Few investigations have drawn such intense public interest as the Special Commission of Inquiry into the Ruby Princess being conducted by Bret Walker SC. On March 8, passengers disembarked from the ill-fated vessel in Sydney, including 158 people who had reported ill, 13 of whom had high temperatures. The ship then reloaded and sailed for New Zealand with 2700 new passengers and 1100 crew. That group returned to Sydney on March 19 and also was allowed to disembark at Circular Quay without health checks — even though some on board were showing signs of respiratory illness. That rare debacle in Australia’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching consequences. More than 664 passengers have since tested positive for coronavirus, and 22 have died of complications relating to the virus. More than 200 crew members also tested positive. And the ship has been linked to cluster outbreaks in northwest Tasmania and New Zealand.
A few days after the ship docked in Sydney for the second time amid rising public concern, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian raised the political stakes when she tried to fit up Australian Border Force officers for the disastrous decision to let the 2700 people on the second cruise disembark without testing, as Yoni Bashan revealed after one of Ms Berejiklian’s colleagues spilled the beans following a partyroom meeting.
Mr Walker has made it clear the inquiry is about fact finding, not apportioning blame. In carrying out the unenviable task of getting at the truth of who was responsible for the problems, he and his team need to ask hard questions. The Australian acknowledged that when we questioned Scott Morrison’s judgment in suggesting Mr Walker was “aggressive” and “a bit out of line” in his questioning of NSW epidemiologist Kelly-Anne Ressler, who cried in the witness box. But in a society that puts a premium on free speech and public sector transparency, the special commission and the volatile NSW politics that led to its instigation are not beyond scrutiny and critical comment.
The Australian’s David Penberthy exercised that right on May 7. His article drew a hostile statement from the senior counsel assisting the commission, Richard Beasley SC. As legal affairs editor Chris Merritt writes on Wednesday, Mr Beasley’s edgy political philosophy and his retweets on some of the politics of coronavirus make interesting reading. But more important, in terms of free speech and the public right to know — basic tenets of our democracy — what is alarming is that The Australian was asked to provide information to the commission to be considered “as to whether the comments in Mr Penberthy’s article … might constitute a contempt”.
The commission was extremely protective of its independence and anything that could be seen as a threat to its ability to discharge its duties. We endorse that sentiment. Independence and impartiality are crucial, particularly when examining the conduct of governments and their agencies. But so is public scrutiny of this inquiry. As our lawyer wrote to the commission, Penberthy’s article was intended to be “a discussion of political matters and in particular the NSW state government’’. It was not intended to be critical of the inquiry, the commissioner or commission staff. Nor did we intend to call into question the commissioner’s integrity. The Australian unreservedly apologised and withdrew any criticism of the commissioner or the inquiry. That said, free speech — like the perception of independence and impartiality — is fragile indeed. It must not be allowed to become a casualty of the coronavirus crisis.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Nation draws together as COVID-19 fight intensifies	The Australian	The public understands why restrictions must be stepped up
Australians, quiet and strong, can handle the truth about COVID-19 and its effects, as we said on Saturday. The nation now enters the next phase of restrictions necessitated by the global medical emergency. The national cabinet, comprising Scott Morrison, premiers and chief ministers, who have put politics aside to co-operate well, have agreed that all incoming international travellers — returning citizens and visitors — must self-quarantine for 14 days. Flights will continue to operate to allow Australians to return home; but the restriction will reduce international visitor numbers to a trickle. Cruise ships from foreign ports have been banned. Handshakes are out; people need to keep their distance from each other. And, as foreshadowed last week, non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people are no longer permitted. Further steps, such as restricting visits to nursing homes, are set to be announced this week. Remote communities will receive special attention and Anzac Day will not be the same this year. As Chief Health Officer Professor Brendan Murphy and Health Minister Greg Hunt have made clear, no options are off the table, including a nationwide lockdown such as those in place in Italy and France, or a partial lockdown.
The tone and content of the Prime Minister’s press conference on Sunday were sensible and measured, as he took the nation into his confidence. Doing so, The Australian argued last week, was vital. Using two clear graphs to explain why the new restrictions were necessary — to “flatten the curve’’ by slowing the rate of infection — he increased the likelihood of bringing the nation with him to confront the pandemic and its fallout. Several schools at which staff or students have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are closed. But at this stage, most schools will remain open. Closing them could be more harmful than helpful, allowing large numbers of young people into the community, where they could carry the virus to grandparents and others. Closing schools would also add to the pressures of medical staff with children, at a time when every available hand is needed to deal with the unprecedented health emergency.
Cases are multiplying. On Sunday, 298 cases had been confirmed in Australia. A week earlier, the total was 80 cases, and 140 by Thursday last week. Flattening the curve is vital to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed and forced to make agonising decisions about who to save and who to let go. With the number of infections doubling every few days, the number of cases would pass 10,000 in less than six weeks unless the spread is slowed. On Friday, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant warned that 1.5 million people in the state were ­likely to ­become infected, yet the nation has only 2000 intensive care beds. Other wards will need to be equipped for that purpose. But finding additional medical, nursing and support staff will be far harder. Hospitals are already dependent on large numbers of overseas medical staff. Many people, for good reason, are concerned about the preparedness of the public hospital system to cope. The Newspoll published on Monday shows 51 per cent of Australians are worried, 47 per cent confident and 2 per cent uncommitted. A strong majority of 69 per cent, however, are confident about the amount of information provided to citizens on how to protect themselves. Those messages are being reinforced by new government advertising focusing on basic but vital facts such as hygiene and when to see a doctor (and the need to call ahead first). After his support plummeted during the bushfire emergency, Mr Morrison can take comfort that the poll shows he has again overtaken Anthony Albanese as preferred prime minister. The shift suggests he is cutting through on COVID-19. Doing so is essential, given the danger and complexity of the unfolding pandemic.
As Mr Morrison points out, the illness is more severe than influenza but for about eight out of 10 of those diagnosed it will be relatively mild. On the other hand, it is far more serious for the elderly and for others whose health is vulnerable. As The Times has reported from London, intensive care specialists warn that some who survive severe cases of the illness will suffer damage to their lungs, heart and other organs. They will need up to 15 years to recover fully. The Australian scientists who know COVID-19 best warn it is “10 times worse” than flu and spreading faster in Western countries than it did in China, Jamie Walker reports. Those scientists, led by molecular virologist Paul Young, are zeroing in on a vaccine at the University of Queensland.Knowing that a vaccine will not be available until at least December, households are now dealing with anxiety, scarcity and varying degrees of isolation. Relatives, friends and neighbours can do much to help the housebound, especially the elderly. As Mr Morrison says, make a casserole and leave it at their doors. The coming months will be most Australians’ first experience of the “spirit of the Blitz’’.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Sanders, an odd frontrunner	The Australian	The rabid socialist takes momentum into Super Tuesday
Bernie Sanders’s convincing victory in Nevada’s caucuses — following Iowa and New Hampshire — will further boost his status as the Democrats’ frontrunner to take on Donald Trump. Senator Sanders’s win in Nevada, the first state with a significant share of non-white voters, added momentum to the 78-year-old socialist’s campaign ahead of Democratic primaries in 15 states in the next two weeks. At the same time, it will increase the nervousness of party leaders who believe a Sanders nomination will doom the party to defeat in November. A new Wall Street Journal/ NBC poll shows the senator has a four-point lead in a theoretical national contest against the President. It also shows former vice-president Joe Biden, the party’s leading moderate, with an 8 per cent lead against Mr Trump and outsider Mike Bloomberg with a 7 per cent lead.
But Senator Sanders’s 47 per cent share of the Nevada vote left Mr Biden trailing on 20 per cent, with Pete Buttigieg on 15 per cent. Senator Sanders won among all groups — men, women, Hispanics, non-Hispanics, those with and without college degrees, and union and non-union members. He said he was riding a “multigenerational, multiracial” wave that “is going to sweep this country”. That remains to be seen. Establishment Democrats fear that if he has a strong showing in states such as California on Super Tuesday (March 3) he will be unstoppable. Their concerns are justified. Choosing a socialist espousing high-tax, Jeremy Corbyn-style policies would carry immense risks for the Democrats in a nation that is capitalist to the core. Senator Sanders, 78, also is recovering from a major heart attack in October.It remains difficult to believe he will be the Democrats’ nominee. But as Mr Trump showed four years ago, never say never. Prevailing wisdom is that Senator Sanders’s policies make him unelectable. But Mr Trump was seen as unelectable in 2016. His approval rating has suffered little damage and possibly gained ground since his impeachment trial. His approval rating is 47 per cent, behind Barack Obama and George W. Bush who were both at 50 per cent when they were seeking election at this point. Mr Trump’s ratings on the economy are higher, however.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Frydenberg’s Facebook triumph	The Australian	The reforms signal a new era of competitive, digital innovation Measured by degree of difficulty, Josh Frydenberg has just landed a 10 out of 10. Not only has the Treasurer, with the support of Scott Morrison, long championed the need to address the market imbalances and the resultant distortions created by the rapid unchecked emergence of the tech giants, but he has personally driven high-stakes negotiations to nail a highly technical and quite remarkable manoeuvre. Unusually in modern politics, which is so often overshadowed by popularism and partisan polarity, Mr Frydenberg has pursued, somewhat bravely and with a single-minded purpose, and then delivered on a reform promise that many Australians would not have considered a priority or well understood. But in fact that reform is fundamental to a properly functioning, healthy society in which important, sensible, sometimes challenging public debate can flourish and inform rather than continue to allow the rapid emergence of an unhealthy information landscape that promotes emasculation over emancipation.
Mr Frydenberg stands apart today from lawmakers around the world who have not been able to pull off such a delicate and technically difficult legislative outcome. Incredibly, the Treasurer has managed to personally convince the leaders of Google, and the notoriously ruthless founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, to sign up to a multimillion-dollar regime unlike any other attempted elsewhere in the world.
The government, with admirable cross-party support in the parliament, took on a challenge it could have easily ignored. In doing so it also managed to expose to the Australian community exactly why it needed to act, when Google and Facebook revealed their hands and threatened to pull the plug on Australians. As part of the deal, Facebook will restore news content to Australians. The government will push ahead with laws that work as a backstop to force digital companies to negotiate to pay for content they currently take for free. There have been minor changes agreed to the new laws, including giving notice to services that will be covered, but not to the centrepiece recommended by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission for final offer arbitration if commercial agreement cannot be reached. The about-face by both Google, which threatened to withdraw service from Australia, and Facebook, which blocked sites extending well beyond news media, is of international significance. Since making its threat, Google has negotiated agreements with major publishers, including with News Corp, globally. Regulators are co-operating across jurisdictions including the US, Canada, Europe and Australia to bring the digital giants to heel. The issues go well beyond threats to the financial viability of journalism and focus on the monopoly powers of major digital companies and how they are prepared to use these powers to eliminate competition and challenge government. The global pushback includes antitrust actions in the US to challenge monopoly behaviour and efforts to break the vertical integration stranglehold that a small number of digital companies have on the multibillion-dollar online advertising market. The Treasurer was able to declare on Tuesday that Facebook had “re-friended Australia”. Facebook had committed to entering into good-faith negotiations with Australian news media businesses and seeking to reach agreements to pay for content. Global analysts agree that Facebook and Google overplayed their hands in Australia. It was interpreted as hubris, a demonstration of what Mr Morrison said was a belief by big tech companies that they were bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them. From railroads to telecommunications, corporate history is littered with examples of pioneers that have grown too big, exploited monopoly power and been cut down by regulators. The push-back on big tech, started in Australia, could open a new era of competitive digital innovation that will benefit everyone.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Dreamworld’s abject safety failures endangered lives	The Australian	The report must ensure such negligence is never repeated
Queensland Coroner James McDougall’s probe into the deaths of four people on the most popular ride at Australia’s most popular theme park, Dreamworld, north of the Gold Coast, will send shudders through families who have braved the attraction. The report into the deaths of Cindy Low, Kate Goodchild, her brother Luke Dorsett and his partner Roozi Araghi on the Thunder River Rapids ride on October 25, 2016, exposed unconscionable disregard for safety by Dreamworld’s parent company, Ardent Leisure. It detailed shoddy record keeping that was “a significant contributing factor” and uncovered a negligent, greedy corporate culture that put profits before safety. “It is surprising, given the state of the safety management systems in place at Dreamworld, that a tragedy of this nature had not occurred before now,” Mr McDougall wrote. “It was simply a matter of time.” He was unambiguous in sheeting home the blame to the Ardent Leisure board at the time of the tragedy. Such a culpable culture, he said, “can only exist when leadership from the board down are careless in respect of safety”.
State regulators also fell far short of ensuring safety standards the public is entitled to expect. They placed “unjustified trust” in Dreamworld’s willingness to observe proper safety and maintenance systems. The Office of Industrial Relations insisted that its officers did on-site auditing of theme park rides and that they were proactive with the industry about safety. Yet none picked up the “dangerous state” of the Thunder River Rapids ride as described by independent engineers and inspectors after the tragedy. Mr McDougall also noted the “unjustified trust” of government regulators as to the effectiveness of the safety and maintenance systems: “Clearly, given the nature of this tragedy, and the surrounding circumstances, including the lack of record management, the ­absence of any meaningful hazard assessments or effective engineering oversight of these devices, this was simply not the case.” The systems, he said, were “rudimentary” at best.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who prefers a low profile when bad news breaks, has been quiet since the report’s release on Monday. Her Industrial Relations Minister, Grace Grace, said the government accepted the findings. As recommended, the matter has been referred to the independent Work Health and Safety Prosecutor to decide what action, if any, will be taken against Ardent Leisure, under the Work Health and Safety Act. Mr McDougall said it was “reasonably suspected that Ardent Leisure may have committed an offence under workplace law”. With the exception of the company’s former chief executive Deborah Thomas, who threw little light on the salient issues, the coroner’s report was met initially by a wall of silence from the company’s former directors, who included executives with extensive business experience. Late on Tuesday, public relations spinner Tim L’Estrange issued a statement on behalf of the former board, saying the report was a “milestone”. The statement did not address the findings but expressed the hope they would “prevent such a tragedy” occurring again.Queensland passed industrial manslaughter legislation in the wake of the accident, but it does not apply retrospectively. Given Queensland’s range of theme parks — the Gold Coast has four, with others dotted throughout the state — it is reasonable to expect world’s best practice safety standards. Even before the release of the report, Labor had implemented most of the safety recommendations, modernising a facet of the leisure sector where slackness was rife for too long. Major inspections of all amusement rides by qualified engineers will be held every 10 years, in addition to existing yearly inspections. Theme parks face a more rigorous licensing regime, including full safety assessments of all rides. More stringent record keeping for all amusement rides as regards inspections, maintenance and operator competency is required. An additional 33 inspectors and three engineers have been employed. Major theme parks also will face annual audits. Ms Grace, sensibly, has looked to Florida in a push to ensure safety meets world standards. Theme park goers deserve nothing less.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
PM leads with reservists, firebombers, recovery plan	The Australian	The response to the fire emergency has been stepped up
It was slow coming. But the Morrison government is now providing the national leadership Australia’s bushfire emergency demands. Some of the communications surrounding weekend announcements were inept. NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons should have been told that Canberra was committing 3000 army reservists to help fight the blazes rather than having to find out from television. That communication breakdown became even more embarrassing for Scott Morrison when it became clear his staff had found time to make a social media video promoting the government's response to the fires. But the last thing fire-ravaged communities need is a blame game. In light of the significant initiatives that have been taken, such bungles were minor. What matters is what is being done. Despite being roundly criticised for being uncharacteristically tin-eared in handling the issue, Mr Morrison is beginning to turn the situation around. He needed to do so.
On Saturday, at the National Security Committee of cabinet, the government flicked the switch from responding to the requests of states, which are responsible for disaster management, to launching important initiatives of its own. These included the reservists’ boots on the ground, the funding of four more waterbombing aircraft, deployment of extra defence equipment, including HMAS Adelaide — which has arrived off the NSW south coast to help with recovery efforts from the town of Eden — and opening army bases for emergency short-term accommodation. The ADF is in for the long haul, a commitment that should help allay the fears of those in the fire paths. While mainly symbolic, Mr Morrison’s relocating his family to Canberra was a good move. There, he will receive daily ADF briefings. Smoke shrouding the capital has caused shops and public facilities to close.
On Sunday, Mr Morrison announced that former Australian Federal Police commissioner Andrew Colvin will lead a national bushfire recovery agency. The National Security Committee of cabinet will finalise the details on Monday, but the agency will work in conjunction with state authorities and defence efforts to finalise plans for the organisation. The agency will play a vital role for at least two years, delivering federal funding to local councils to rebuild critical infrastructure and to farmers to re-erect fences and remove animal carcasses from properties. Like the national drought and North Queensland flood recovery agencies, it will also co-ordinate income support for households and small businesses affected by the fires. It will also oversee the provision of mental health support for people affected. Establishment of such a body, with a national perspective, is an important step.
On Thursday, The Australian pointed out that bushfire disaster is too vast and complex for a piecemeal approach. The recovery agency headed by Mr Colvin will co-ordinate rebuilding from a national perspective. Mr Morrison and premiers will discuss vital medium-term issues such as the overhaul of hazard-reduction, land-clearing and planning laws at the next Council of Australian Governments meeting in March. A national perspective and input will be important. But as Mr Morrison said, such matters, which are state responsibilities, are best handled locally.
On the ground, with late summer traditionally being the worst season for bushfires in southern regions of the continent, many fear the worst still lies ahead. Spasmodic rainfall and milder weather gave some places a welcome breather on Sunday. In other areas, infernos raged or intensified. Residents and visitors to Eden on the NSW far south coast and surrounding areas were forced to evacuate or shelter on boats. As of Sunday night, 150 fires were still burning across NSW and 48 in Victoria, including three that were threatening communities, including Myrtleford near Mount Buffalo in the snowfields country, which was evacuated late on Sunday. Despite cooler temperatures in the south of NSW easing the immediate threat to the power grid, more than 24,500 homes and businesses in the region may be without electricity for the rest of this week, adding to hardships in an area where many have lost their homes. Severe bushfires in the Snowy Mountains still threaten connections to the Snowy Mountains hydro scheme.Among the latest known victims of the fires, bush pilot Dick Lang, 78, and his son Clayton, 43, a surgeon, were found on Kangaroo Island, where 170,000 hectares — a third of the island — have burnt. Grave fears are also held for the safety of four people still missing in fire-ravaged areas of Victoria. Given the swaths of countryside burnt out across all states since September — an area larger than Denmark or Holland — the skill and dogged bravery of fire crews has been extraordinary in containing the number of deaths to 23. Tragic as each loss is, the cost to human life could have been many times worse.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
JobKeeper and IR critical to building jobs rebound	The Australian	The resumption of parliament should help drive recovery
This week’s resumption of federal parliament after a nine-week hiatus is an opportunity for the Morrison government to optimise conditions for economic rebuilding and job creation. It will introduce the JobKeeper 2.0 legislation, which will see fortnightly payments reduced from $1500 to $1200 from September 28. It will also seek to extend temporary industrial relations changes to workers who will not receive the wage subsidy beyond September. The fortnight of sitting will be crucial in steering recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. After this session, parliament next meets for the budget on October 6. In debating the JobKeeper and workplace relations legislation, all sides of politics need to be constructive in putting the economy ahead of partisan pointscoring and sectional interests.
The government’s chances of passing its legislation in the Senate without Labor and the Greens have improved, as Rosie Lewis reports, after Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff confirmed he and Rebekha Sharkie would support it. One Nation is reportedly “sympathetic’’. The legislation is not yet available for scrutiny. But in principle, targeted, temporary stimulus measures need to be precisely that — not a harbinger of indefinite spending. JobKeeper has done a sterling job of keeping households afloat and workers on companies’ books. But, where possible, it is time to begin winding it back.
Amid a pandemic that has seen 500 million jobs lost worldwide, as Josh Frydenberg writes on Monday, a new Treasury analysis shows an impressive rebound in jobs in Australia between April and July. It has been led by NSW, where 70 per cent of workers who lost their jobs or were stood down had returned to some form of work by July. Treasury’s analysis shows a total of 689,000 of the 1.3 million jobs lost or frozen across the country during the economic hibernation were recovered between April and July. And almost half of all those jobs recovered were in NSW, contributing to a significant decline in taxpayer-funded welfare payments. But, as Simon Benson writes, the national recovery has been undermined by the unavoidable lockdown in Victoria in response to its second, deadly wave of COVID-19 and border closures. Queensland’s border closures have not served it well, leaving it with the highest effective unemployment in the nation.
While jobs recovery remains uncertain, extending workplace relations changes for another six months is good economic policy. Allowing employers the flexibility to direct an employee to work fewer hours, take leave or change duties is a useful strategy to assist struggling businesses and save jobs. Opposition IR spokesman Tony Burke’s criticism that Scott Morrison wants to “make it easier for workers to lose their pay, hours and rights” shows scant concern for current conditions facing businesses and their staff. Aside from the obvious benefits to workers and their families, boosting jobs growth is vital to lifting income tax revenue, reducing dependence on government and lifting consumer confidence and spending. The national GST pie is set to be $300m smaller this year, mainly because of Victoria’s six-week, stage-four lockdown, reducing the scope of states for spending in transport, education and health. From behind their masks, the challenge for MPs and senators this fortnight is to focus on decisions geared to regrow the economy from one its most difficult starting points in 90 years.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
In dark times, let’s shine a light	The Australian	The right to know is vital as we face strategic challenges Next Thursday, it will be a year since the Australian Federal Police raided and searched the Canberra home of News Corp Australia journalist Annika Smethurst. She had reported government plans for an agency monitoring foreign intelligence to turn its sights on Australian citizens, a topic of obvious public interest. Yet Smethurst, who was doing her job serving the right of the public to be informed, has had hanging over her the possibility of criminal charges for an alleged breach of secrecy. Last month’s High Court ruling that the AFP warrant was unlawful must have eased the pressure; on Wednesday, the AFP said it would not charge her after all. Two ABC journalists, whose reporting of war-crimes allegations led to an AFP raid the day after Smethurst’s house was searched, remain in limbo.
Without robust media freedom to report and analyse, the public’s right to know and to be informed as full citizens is rendered null and void. When Smethurst filed her news reports in the autumn of 2018, Australia’s strategic and security outlook was already grim. To the existing threat of jihadist mass murder was added emerging evidence of foreign interference. Now our independent policy as a nation is under pressure from China, our biggest trading partner. Democracy across the developed world is under strain with polarised politics and social media weaponising of core issues. COVID-19 has the potential to make this worse by destroying jobs and livelihoods and setting us up for the misery and instability of a deep global recession.
To get through this, we will need facts, data, sharp analysis and a wide range of viewpoints, minimising the dysfunction and distraction of personal attacks, party political games and sterile symbolic disputes. We need intelligent and pragmatic decisions across government, the economy and society about what to do, and what to avoid. Australians rightly worried about the country and future generations expect this. That is why, right now, they are turning to reputable news sources such as The Australian in record numbers.
The Morrison government has acknowledged that institutions and policies must be rigorously vetted to ensure they give us the best chance of a swift return to prosperity, stability and security. The official culture and laws that unwisely restrain media freedom — chiefly defamation laws and national security provisions — cannot be exempt from this national interest test. Certainly there are sensible limits to media freedom: editors are conscious of the need to draw clear lines protecting national security and personal reputation from unwarranted incursions. It is also true that media freedom comes with a duty of balance and accuracy in coverage. But too often the official insistence on secrecy is a denial of accountability. Like any other policy area, counter-terrorism and intelligence operations will be less prone to going off the rails if there is careful media scrutiny in the public interest. What is complained of as a criminal breach of secrecy may in fact be a routine case of embarrassment for politicians and bureaucrats who have been caught out. The coronavirus pandemic reinforces this need for open, informed debate. It is a scientific question that demands the sharing of data and research so that political leaders can apply expertise and moral values to arrive at the best decisions for society. COVID-19 is not just a public health issue, it is a strategic challenge. And so the government response is doubly in need of close media scrutiny enabling informed public debate. This is quite different from a journalistic “gotcha” exercise. Solid, independent reporting can lead to inept policymakers paying a political price, but this is incidental. Accurate media coverage also vindicates decision-makers who take pains to arm themselves with the necessary information and do the right thing by the country, even at personal cost. And this is the kind of leadership we need, now more than ever.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Diplomacy before sanctions	The Australian	The safe return of Sean Turnell from Myanmar is DFAT’s priority
Australia has a deep interest in the future stability of a democratic Myanmar but should not rush to follow the US with sanctions. The priority for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade must be the welfare and repatriation of Australian Sean Turnell, who is in custody following the military coup that deposed the civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The nation’s long-term strategic interests will be best served by working co-operatively with Association of Southeast Asian Nations leaders including Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore to bring an end to military rule in Myanmar. The coup in Myanmar is a clear example of where Australia can demonstrate the maturity of its relationship with the US by exercising its own mind.
As foreign editor Greg Sheridan wrote on Thursday, the opening up of Myanmar before the latest coup has been transformative for its citizens and of benefit to the region. Australia has developed strong links with Myanmar’s military and civilian leaders and institutions. We must, of course, denounce the military coup that has stopped Ms Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy, which overwhelmingly won democratic elections last November, from taking office. As Myanmar citizens have taken to the streets in protest, the military has stepped up its intimidation, ransacking NLD headquarters and using water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets against civilian demonstrators. If the worrying trend of rising street violence at the hands of the military continues Australia will need to reconsider sanctions of its own. But that point has not yet been reached.
The danger in overreacting before events in Yangon have been given a chance to settle would be to push Myanmar back into isolation and further into the embrace of China. With Cambodia and Laos already client states of Beijing, adding Myanmar would give Beijing de facto veto control over three of ASEAN’s 10 states. ASEAN leaders have a big incentive to work for a peaceful resolution and restoration of democracy.
There are welcome signs in Joe Biden’s decision to impose limited sanctions directed at Myanmar’s military leaders. The choice of limited sanctions demonstrates the administration intends to be more fully engaged with the region and that Mr Biden will be outspoken on issues of human rights.
This message was conveyed by the US President to Xi Jinping on Wednesday (US time) in their first telephone contact since Mr Biden took office. He told the Chinese President the US had fundamental concerns about Beijing’s coercive and unfair economic practices, its crackdown in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang and increasingly assertive actions in the region, including towards Taiwan. Mr Biden simultaneously approved an executive order enabling the US “to immediately sanction the military leaders who directed the coup, their business interests as well as close family members”. Targeting coup leaders is preferable to imposing sanctions that more directly affect ordinary citizens. But at this stage Australia’s interests are best served working for the safe return of Mr Turnell and with our ASEAN partners to keep lines of dialogue open and guide a return to democracy in Myanmar.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
New weapon to tackle COVID	The Australian	The scientific evidence in favour of masks has increased
Personal liberties are vitally important in our democracy. For a serious reason — the fight against terrorism — Australians have surrendered some liberties in recent years. The Andrews government has told the people of Melbourne and the Mitchell shire to do so now, in the fight against COVID-19. The compulsory wearing of masks outside home and school, with $200 fines for noncompliance, goes against the principle of choice.
On the positive side, scientific evidence increasingly suggests facial coverings help prevent transmission of the virus, even if an infected wearer is in contact with others. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says the pandemic could be controlled in four to eight weeks if “we could get everybody to wear a mask”. If so, masks are a small price to allow the economy to function as well as possible, saving businesses and jobs and limiting public debt. Masks are a health issue, not a political issue, and should be treated as such. Victorian authorities must ensure masks are readily available to all.
Health Minister Greg Hunt is backing Victoria’s decision as a potential life-saver. And he reiterated the importance of testing and contact tracing. Nor should anybody think a mask is a substitute for handwashing and social distancing. Medical experts have warned that even the best masks are not foolproof. But they appear to be a useful tool. And they do not impede on work, shopping and other activities. Grim statistics at the weekend underlined why every reasonable tool is needed to fight the virus, especially if more drastic and costly restrictions are to be avoided. Of 363 new cases in Victoria on Sunday, 330 were from unknown sources. Of 2837 active cases in the state, 130 people are in hospital, 28 in intensive care. NSW’s caseload rose by 15, with acting national Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly warning the potential for virus transmission was higher in NSW, which has fewer restrictions than Melbourne. The overseas situation shows the speed of the contagion, with 10,000 new cases daily in both Florida and Texas, where frontline doctors say they have “never seen anything like this COVID surge’’.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Every dollar you donate to GetUp is a waste of money	The Australian	The self-styled activist group is a nasty, partisan hit squad
Trust in the political system is taking a battering. According to the Australian National University’s election study, only 59 per cent of voters are satisfied with how Australian democracy is working, down from a hefty 86 per cent in 2007. A mere one-quarter of respondents in the post-poll survey said people in government could be trusted, the lowest level recorded since 1987, when this version of the study began. Certainly, major parties of the left and right are being fitted up for the dysfunctional policy-making that has marked the past decade. But as last year’s federal election showed, the Americanisation of electioneering has brought two poisonous strains into our politics. One was the $80m tulip-yellow plague of Clive Palmer’s United Australia Party, its nutty populism and mindless jingles polluting the bought media space. Big, ugly money politics is here. The other was GetUp’s nasty, brutish hit squads. As Paul Kelly observed mid-campaign of the two groups, “if their 2019 performance is our future, then our democracy, like our society, is becoming more toxic, hysterical, negative and polarised”.
GetUp presents as a moral, mass movement, committed to ridding the nation of extremism, but is itself a purveyor of out-there ideology. It is secretive, undemocratic and a law unto itself. We welcome political debate and participation. But unlike others in the fray, GetUp doesn’t exist to elect people to parliament — its business model is to destroy careers. During last year’s campaign, the left activist group and unions conducted a sickening all-out assault on South Australian Liberal Nicolle Flint. The repulsive personal attacks on the member for Boothby created an environment for abuse, harassment, intimidation, shouting, even stalking to become the “new normal”, Ms Flint told our newspaper. The onslaughts were designed to inflict mental and physical disintegration on the MP. Such tactics can only scare good people from public life.
Other Liberals targeted by GetUp were Peter Dutton, Kevin Andrews, Christian Porter, Greg Hunt and Tony Abbott. The group’s attack on the former prime minister — who lost his seat of Warringah to independent Zali Steggall — was beyond the pale. A campaign ad depicted Mr Abbott as a lifesaver refusing to rescue a drowning swimmer calling for help. When the swimmer disappears under the water, the actor playing the former prime minister mimics his idiosyncratic laugh. At the time, we said it was an abysmal low in political advertising. The ad ran after two Victorian lifesavers, a father and son, lost their lives while rescuing a man. The Royal Life Saving Society called the ad insensitive; GetUp pulled it but did not apologise to Mr Abbott. It was, however, fundraising genius of sorts, a stunt connecting the activist group with the wallets of its donor base.
And where did that money go? As Brad Norington reported on Monday, GetUp spent more than 70 per cent of the $12.4m in public donations it raised last year on salaries, administration costs and travel. Hold on, doesn’t the leftist group boast “every dollar you donate to GetUp is used to build a more fair, flourishing and just Australia”? We suppose there’s some marketing juice in that phrasing, but the spiel goes on to claim “your donation will be used to fund billboards”, “hard-hitting TV ads into the lounge rooms” of key seats and “rallies demonstrating people power”. Such a contribution is an “investment in extraordinary impact”. Nice impact, if you can get some. Many people will feel dudded by these odd priorities.
Still, GetUp operates in a political and charitable twilight zone. It’s neither a charity, nor a political entity, even though its ruling collective of directors is overwhelmingly from the Labor side of politics. GetUp was found “prima facie” to be an associated entity of Labor or the Greens by the Australian Electoral­ Commission, after a detaile­d investigation of the activ­ist group’s campaigning activity during the 2016 federal election. But the finding, which would have undermined GetUp’s claim to be independent and imposed tougher financial disclosur­e, was reversed a year ago after the AEC sought submissions from GetUp and secured legal advice. It was the third time GetUp was able to shake itself loose of the rules governing political parties and their surrogates.This self-styled movement can say and do as it pleases. So it does. GetUp volunteers accost voters at polling booths with dodgy scripts and engage in push-polling over the phone. The group concocts misleading ads, spruiks for one side of politics. While it claims to have one million “supporters”, sometimes more, GetUp is not run on democratic lines. Its “board” is stacked with Labor partisans, its organisational rules are opaque. GetUp is a political thug, a vanity project for insiders and a not very well concealed weapon with which to whack conservative warriors. This sorry outfit of progressive grifters sucks up funds to spend on itself, all the while preening as a superior force for worthwhile change. Bob Marley sang, “Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights!” For those who want a better Australia, we’d add, don’t give up the fight — or your credit card details.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Public patience is snapping	The Australian	The sensible, effective lockdown has been reduced to a farce
Brisbane-based federal Labor frontbencher Graham Perrett is unapologetic about participating in Saturday’s Black Lives Matter protest in Brisbane. He says he took “every precaution possible … stayed at the back and as far away from people as possible”. Not that far, and he had plenty of people behind him, pictures show. Mr Perrett’s participation, like that of Greens senator Janet Rice and Victorian Liberal Democrats MP David Limbrick, is an irritant to those who resent the “one rule for some, another for the rest of us” aspect of the protests and how they were handled. If Mr Limbrick was fishing for kudos when he said he “knew personally there were risks for me” but “I thought it was important”, he is out of synch with voters. The hypocrisy and incompetence of state leaders, irrespective of the importance of indigenous justice, is snapping public patience after three months of sacrifices and with years of financial struggle ahead. “Any further enforcing of social-distancing laws will simply be a joke!”, was how one reader, John, summed up the situation online.
Businesses have had enough, for good reason. Gold Coast restaurateurs have floated the idea of putting up banners and staging a “protest day” in the hope they would not have to turn diners away from empty tables. In Sydney, Sal Navarra, chief executive of Navarra Venues, will reopen the company’s wedding venues to “any numbers” next month after the government allowed 15,000 to 20,000 people to gather last weekend. Premier Gladys Berejiklian has pleaded for public patience, insisting there is “no excuse” for “anybody thinking they’re above the health orders”. That was not the case on Saturday, however, as police stood by while thousands behaved as though they were “above the health orders”.
This pervasive double standard did not deter Victoria Police from closing Mornington Peninsula pier on Monday over concerns fishermen were “not observing social-distancing requirements”. Nor were they jammed in like sardines, like the weekend protest crowds. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews was back into his panic-mode persona on Tuesday, warning “We are nowhere near the end of it (coronavirus).” So was Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. Unmoved by a giant billboard installed by Gold Coast LNP member Michael Hart declaring “planes equal jobs … open the borders”, Ms Palaszczuk has thwarted the AFL’s plan to have fans attend this weekend’s games. The federal government’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Nick Coatsworth, has brought a more realistic perspective to the subject of footy crowds. The issue, he said, was a large number of people coming together, then dispersing across cities. But he added: “You can be a little more controlled in a stadium than you can in a protest.” Ms Palaszczuk’s refusal to accept that her government’s closure of the state’s borders has hurt tourism companies — a claim outlined in documents filed in the High Court — can hardly be taken seriously. Given their apparent fear of COVID-19, it is incomprehensible that state leaders did not act effectively to prevent Saturday’s demonstrations, or have barriers erected to spread out crowds, or insist on fining those who broke social-distancing rules. If, as expected, national cabinet delays the wholesale easing of COVID-19 restrictions in response to the protests, the fiasco will have a hefty price tag. It could cost the national economy more than $1bn and prevent tens of thousands of people getting back to work. Alongside public indignation, the fact coronavirus cases have topped seven million worldwide, with a death toll of 400,000, puts Australia’s situation in a sobering perspective. The conscientious efforts of business and households have placed us in a strong position to embark on economic recovery. But the states’ lack of control of the protests has marred that spirit of co-operation.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Remembering a tragic day	The Australian	The shooting prompted reforms to live-streaming online
Sunday’s scheduled commemoration in New Zealand marking the first anniversary of the Christchurch terrorist attack had to be cancelled, sadly, due to the coronavirus. In the end, New Zealanders emerged from their homes to mark the date anyway. Drawn out of respect and curiosity, as Paul Maley reported, people began arriving at Christchurch’s Al Noor Mosque from early morning. That was one of two mosques where Australian-born gunman Brenton Tarrant opened fire, killing 51 people on March 15 last year. Tarrant filmed the attack and live-streamed it on Facebook, before it was detected. Facebook removed about 1.5 million videos of the attack. On Sunday, some who came to pay their respects limped in on walking sticks or on crutches; it’s too early for their physical or psychological wounds to have healed. Many who came had never been in a mosque. Powerful lessons flowed from that terrible day that appalled the world, especially Australia, as realisation dawned that Tarrant was born and grew up here.
As New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, Tarrant’s depraved act “changed New Zealand forever”. It was a day New Zealanders will never forget. The small nation, known the world over as a peaceful and compassionate place, at ease with its diversity, was shaken profoundly. It was wounded by the attacks, but not broken. As Ms Ardern said as the shock began sinking in, the attacks “occurred in a place where people should have been expressing their religious freedom”.
Following John Howard’s lead after the Port Arthur massacre, tough new gun laws in New Zealand have seen 56,000 weapons handed in. Ms Ardern has also led an international drive known as the Christchurch Call to Action that has seen 48 governments and eight major social media companies join forces to fight terrorism and violent extremism online. A royal commission investigating events relating to the attacks, including the performance of security agencies, will report next month.
Australia marked Sunday’s anniversary, with Scott Morrison praising New Zealanders for responding “to hate with love’’. The Prime Minister reflected our national mood on Sunday when he said: “Australia stands in unity and solidarity with New Zealand … we stand side by side with our Kiwi brothers and sisters as we remember and honour the victims and their loved ones.” Both nations, Mr Morrison said, were committed to peace and freedom, and continued to reject those who spread division and hatred.Labor frontbenchers Kristina Keneally and Andrew Giles captured the same spirit. “Our hearts broke for our New Zealand sisters and brothers who had their family, friends, loved ones and community leaders prematurely taken from them,’’ they recalled. The growth in right-wing extremism, they said, and the threat it posed, could not be ignored. Challenges lie ahead. Tarrant, facing trial on 51 murder charges, 40 attempted murder charges and one terrorism charge, wants to use his trial to champion his vile ideology. Sunday’s anniversary, while subdued due to COVID-19, touched the hearts of all decent people on both sides of the Tasman. We stand with those still trying to come to terms with the murder of 51 people in places of refuge and transcendence.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Myanmar needs a circuit-breaker	The Australian	The single worst day of bloodletting in Myanmar since the February 1 coup highlights the urgent need for a more robust response from the international community to the deepening crisis. According to UN envoy Christine Schraner Burgener, at least 38 unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators, including children, were shot dead and many more were wounded on Wednesday when security forces fired into large crowds gathered in cities and towns calling for the release of elected government leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi.
Witnesses have described victims being shot in the head, corroborating the claims of protest leaders who say military snipers have been aiming to kill rather than just disperse crowds angered by the junta’s takeover. Witnesses also reported live rounds of ammunition being fired into crowds without warning, and security forces attacking ambulance crews helping victims. The violence followed Sunday’s clashes in which 18 protesters were shot dead by the military. A protest leader said they “just fired their guns” without warning.
A month after the military takeover, resistance to the coup has not diminished. The BBC reported that after several people were shot dead in Yangon, “more protesters occupied the road, blocking the area with shields and carts and readying themselves to take on the police”.
A meeting on Tuesday of the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations unfortunately failed to produce a coherent attempt to help deal with the crisis and salvage Myanmar’s democratic gains. As Amanda Hodge reported, the best ASEAN could produce was an anodyne statement calling for all parties to “exercise utmost restraint as well as flexibility and to seek a peaceful solution”. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has denounced the “abhorrent violence” and the EU, Britain and Canada have imposed sanctions on the junta. But there is as yet no co-ordinated response from major Western nations. Australia has not imposed new sanctions. Reports of nightly flights from China to Yangon since the coup, with aircraft transponders turned off in defiance of international flight rules, suggest Beijing is operating behind the scenes to help the army in one of Southeast Asia’s most strategic countries, bordering five others. The Quad group of regional democracies — comprising the US, India, Japan and Australia — has reason to be concerned. The generals must be left in no doubt about the economic power the US and its allies could wield if the killing spree continues.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Green shoots suggest a rebound	The Australian	The spirit of the spring of 2000 would be worth recapturing The national cabinet meets on Friday amid tentative signs that Australia is rebounding from the dual health and economic crises that have exacted a terrible toll. The release on Thursday of better-than-expected labour market data was encouraging. While it is far too early to rejoice at the addition of 111,000 new jobs and a better unemployment figure than anticipated, Australians are entitled to draw some comfort from these results. There are also signs that the curve of infection is flattening in Victoria, where failures in quarantine led to rapid community transmission of the virus and one of the harshest lockdowns in the world.
These are tough days for our nation. As Scott Morrison lamented after the national cabinet last met, it has felt as though our commonwealth was beginning to fragment. When the Prime Minister was re-elected by his so-called quiet Australians last year he resolved any doubts about his political skills. Yet not even his most ardent admirers would have seen him as a man of destiny who would be required to steer Australia through what is arguably its greatest peacetime crisis. His ill-advised vacation in the midst of the summer bushfire season cast serious doubts over his judgment under pressure. But as the national cabinet convenes, every member is entitled to draw some comfort from the health and economic data. Federal and state leaders, at times, have been found wanting in their response to the current crisis. But on the evidence emerging this week there are glimmers of optimism. There seem to be green shoots of economic recovery and signs that containment of the virus in Victoria is being achieved. Every Australian, regardless of political affiliation, will wish the national cabinet every success. There has been enough recrimination. There has been enough cheap parochialism. Friday’s meeting appears to coincide with a pivotal moment in Australia’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders, state and federal, must recapture the spirit of shared sacrifice and shared belief in this lucky country and renew their commitment to capitalising on the encouraging metrics emerging.
Amid the tensions of the week, Australians have been nostalgic about that glorious spring of 2000, when we hosted the Olympic Games. The best of the nation was on display: generosity and national pride untainted by jingoism. No Hollywood writer could have scripted Cathy Freeman, a proud First Nations woman, flashing up the home straight to claim gold in the 400m. She had already lit the Olympic flame, lighting a spark in the heart of every Australian.
In the intervening two decades we have not lost those innate Aussie qualities. We are at our best when we turn towards one another, not against one another. This crisis has strained our goodwill, our patience and our faith in our institutions of government. Putrid tribalism in the form of identity politics and impulsive Twitter rantings have undermined our civic discourse. Yet the centre has held. We may well be at a turning point. State and federal leaders need to step back from the brink to which they rushed a fortnight ago and recapture that spirit of 2000. The spirit of two decades ago rather than two weeks ago is required. As shown by the catastrophic collapse of the New Zealand economy, with unemployment almost double that of Australia, there is nothing inherently better in unitary models of government than our federation. Despite the Twitterati’s sneers at Mr Morrison and Josh Frydenberg, they have performed admirably. They have built on foundations that are the legacy of the best policy setting of both major parties in the reforms to our economy since the float of the dollar in 1983. Australians will watch Friday’s deliberations with hope mingled with trepidation. It may not be the beginning of the end of this crisis. Let us hope it is at least the end of the beginning.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
China scores crushing ‘one country, one system’ blow	The Australian	The stage is set for increasing tensions in the Asian region China’s latest crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong underlines the extent to which Xi Jinping’s communist regime has abandoned any pretence of respect for international law or a rules-based world order. Brute force prevailed as more than 360 demonstrators were arrested from among several thousand who gathered on Tuesday to mark the 23rd anniversary of Britain’s handover of Hong Kong. Under China’s security laws that came into force that day, they face severe punishments including extradition to mainland China for trial by courts controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and life imprisonment in Chinese jails. Their “crime” was demanding basic rights and freedoms, such as continued legal autonomy and freedom of speech and assembly. Hong Kong’s people were led to believe these were enshrined in the “one country, two systems” agreement for 50 years. Beijing accepted serious treaty obligations when it signed up to the 1997 agreement. Its contempt for those commitments is indisputable. Rather than being the end of empire, as some supposed at the time, the handover has turned out to be the start of a more pernicious imperialism. The outcome has parallels with the Anschluss in March 1938, when Nazi Germany absorbed Austria, as Paul Monk wrote on Thursday.
Australia is right to consider giving safe haven to Hong Kong citizens. Scott Morrison is considering offering “similar opportunities” to those being provided by Boris Johnson, who has moved to offer pathways for up to three million Hong Kong British nationals to live and work in Britain if they want to flee the new laws outlawing criticism of China. As the leader of the former colonial power with a residual responsibility for Hong Kong’s fate, Mr Johnson has set an example to other Western democracies. Countries such as Australia stand to benefit from the education, skills, work ethic and support for the values of liberal democracy of Hong Kong people escaping the Chinese jackboot.
The ruthless oppression unleashed on Hong Kong is a test for nations and multilateral bodies. In Geneva on Tuesday, the misnamed UN Human Rights Council regrettably voted 53-27 to support China’s crackdown. The motion proposed by Cuba was backed by well-known defenders of human rights and freedom such as North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Zambia and Zimbabwe. From a regional perspective it is disturbing that Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka also voted in favour of it. Their craven support for China’s repression doubtless reflects their gratitude for so-called aid they have received from Beijing’s Belt and Road funding initiative. The attitudes of PNG and Sri Lanka, despite their democratic heritages, demonstrate the effectiveness of “soft power” diplomacy and why it must be countered among regional developing nations.
China’s swift move against Hong Kong’s pro-democracy demonstrators coincides with revelations of its use of forced abortions and forced sterilisations among its Muslim minority, including Uighurs detained in the far west region of Xinjiang. Birthrates have plummeted as a result of a campaign US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has labelled “shocking” and “disturbing”.
The new laws for Hong Kong have increased tensions between CCP supporters in Australia and pro-democracy backers. In Brisbane on Wednesday a man who asked anti-Beijing protesters to identify themselves at a rally was arrested after he hijacked the microphone and scuffled with police. Brisbane resident Huang Wang, 26, was charged with public nuisance and obstructing police. Protest organisers claimed Mr Wang had been moving around the crowd asking people of Chinese appearance to remove their face masks while he tried to film them, as Michael McKenna and Charlie Peel report. The protesters were frightened, understandably, about being identified under what has become a tyrannical system.
Under the new laws, Chinese-Australians accused of subversion or secession activities in Australia, such as pro-democracy rallies, are likely to come under the microscope of authorities if they return to Hong Kong. The law applies to offences “committed against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from outside the region by a person who is not a permanent resident of the region”. Bing Ling, a professor of Chinese law at the University of Sydney, has warned Australians peacefully talking about Hong Kong independence or proposing sanctions on Hong Kong “would be considered criminal and people can be arrested if they enter Hong Kong”. The new laws can only add to regional tensions that have been building in recent years with the militarisation of the South China Sea. More recently, cyber attacks on government and business in Australia and China’s economic retaliation for Australia calling for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19 have seen the bilateral relationship deteriorate further. Last year, China cited Hong Kong as a model for the future of Taiwan. Last month, Chinese aircraft ventured briefly into Taiwanese airspace at least eight times. Pro-independence Taiwanese politician Chen Po-wei notes that as “Hong Kong has become less free, so our sense of fear has increased. Because of China’s nature, there is a high possibility of conflict”. The Prime Minister is right: “There’s much more tension in the cord these days.” The largely benign security environment that Australia enjoyed from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the global financial crisis has gone. Australia’s defence objectives must accord with the strategic environment we face.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
WA budgets on self-interest	The Australian	The state should share its prosperity with the nation With Western Australia’s McGowan Labor government announcing a budget surplus hard on the heels of the federal government’s record deficit, the claim we are all in this together is starting to ring hollow. The stark difference between the federal and WA budgets raises the question of whether state governments have been too willing to leave the heavy lifting to the commonwealth. The exception is NSW, where the borders have been kept open and the economy has been kept largely intact. The Labor states of Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland, by comparison, have been standouts for their insular behaviour.
Victoria is a particular case given the Andrews government’s dreadful performance in containing a second wave of COVID-19. A demand that the commonwealth give Victoria special financial assistance through a higher share of GST to compensate for state government incompetence is breathtaking. So is the shameless politics being played by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in keeping her state borders shut for what clearly appears to be reasons of perceived electoral advantage. Likewise, Mr McGowan has said West Australian borders remain closed to ensure that state residents spend their tourism dollars in WA, something Scott Morrison said was tantamount to economic protectionism.
Mr McGowan doubled down on Thursday, claiming WA’s unique budget surplus justified the state’s contentious hard-border policy. There is some merit in the argument that by protecting the iron ore industry and regions from the first wave of the pandemic the WA economy has helped to keep the national accounts afloat. Both WA and the commonwealth are benefiting from the state’s ability to profit from higher iron ore prices that result from a squeeze on global supply because of the pandemic.
The WA forward estimates show that while iron ore exports are expected to remain steady at about 850 million tonnes across the next few years, the iron ore price is expected to fall from $96.60 a tonne this year to $64 a tonne in 2021-22 as the supply squeeze eases.
The headline figures in the WA budget are for a surplus of $2.21bn this year falling to a deficit of $3.39bn in 2021-22 before coming back into surplus in 2023-24. State revenue is forecast to grow from $32.16bn in 2019-20 to $34.1bn in 2020-21 before retreating slightly to $31.6bn in 2022-23. WA’s strong balance sheet has allowed it to splash out on the biggest infrastructure splurge in WA history rather than pay down state debt.
It is good news for Western Australia but raises difficult questions about the national implications of its successful campaign for a greater share of GST receipts be returned to the state. In the past, booming iron ore prices had resulted in reduced GST payments to WA. The introduction of a floor of 70c in the dollar of GST collected will see WA pocket an additional $3.3bn across the next two years. During his National Press Club address this week, Josh Frydenberg repeated his plea for all states to do their bit to help boost the national economy. Western Australia is allowed to celebrate its good financial fortune but it must be prepared to open its borders and share it with the rest of the nation in a time of need.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Shutting the gate to no avail	The Australian	The states should not misuse police time on border patrols
Aside from offending our sense of national unity and purpose, the practical benefits of closing state borders are illusory. Enforcing the move with RBT-style checks is a waste of limited resources. Nowhere is this clearer than where Coolangatta at the southern end of the Queensland Gold Coast and Tweed Heads in northern NSW overlap. From 12.01am on Thursday, Queensland Police should have better things to do than guard duty, ready to hit interlopers with fines of up to $13,345. Exemptions will be allowed for those travelling to and from work or for medical treatment, for freight and on compassionate grounds. It remains to be seen how a promised permit system for the tens of thousands of motorists who cross the state line each day, often several times a day, will work. On Tuesday, Queensland’s State Disaster Co-ordinator, Steve Gollschewski, said authorities were “trying to find something really simple to be able to identify those cars that can come through so that people can get through really quickly”. Managing the labyrinth of residential and commercial streets that straddle that border will be an interesting challenge.
In regional and remote areas where horizons are wide and police stretched to the limit in the backblocks of the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, border patrols are likely to be perfunctory. In closing borders, state leaders are sending messages to the public to stay home, especially in the school holidays. They also want incoming travellers to undertake 14 days of quarantine. Such issues matter if COVID-19 is to be curtailed. But they could be achieved without the heavy-handed dramatics of border closure. So much for us all being “in this together”, as Scott Morrison says. We are one country, not a half-dozen or more. The move has been well received in Tasmania, where it is seen as viable because the state is an island. But in a single, united nation, preventing people from returning to their home states to visit loved ones, especially during a crisis, is beyond the pale. And in mainland areas where daily lives are lived across state borders, drawing lines on a map to bar entry is senseless. Closed borders may have hastened the closure of national football competitions, but these had no alternative but to shut down anyway.
States need to focus on serious, practical matters. Health officials must do more to ensure supermarkets and small stores insist on customers keeping their hands to themselves. Tapping fresh produce to test its ripeness — which large numbers of shoppers are still doing — needs more than polite signs and boxes of plastic gloves that many are ignoring.Better late than never, Health Minister Greg Hunt has begun reassuring the public about ventilators. Painful and bitter experience in Italy, where 600 people are dying daily and thousands are gasping for breath, shows how vital the machines will be for older and more vulnerable Australians. Given the economy’s idle capacity, companies should be gearing up to make our own where possible. Mr Hunt is moving to double the number of intensive care unit ventilators. That move and upping supplies of effective masks, test kits and hand sanitiser are messages Australians need. Good leadership is not about dividing the continent into quasi-fiefdoms. Shutting the gate wastes time and resources.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Social engineering rife in Victoria’s deep-red budget	The Australian	The state’s big-ticket infrastructure projects are important At a time of bargain basement interest rates, when the Reserve Bank of Australia is urging the states to borrow and build, the infrastructure projects in Tuesday’s Victorian budget will be sound investments. Premier Daniel Andrews and Treasurer Tim Pallas included the $10bn Melbourne Airport Rail Link in partnership with the Morrison government. The state also is contributing $2bn to the state-federal partnership to build fast rail to Geelong and $2.2bn for preliminary work on the Suburban Rail Loop. The Andrews government will pay for 100 new trams to be manufactured in Victoria.
A $4.7bn regional road and rail package and a 50 per cent stamp duty concession for commercial and industrial properties in regional Victoria will help businesses and workers outside the capital. So will the $200m to be spent to help farmers and food producers upgrade infrastructure and invest in new technologies, and the upgrades of agricultural colleges in Horsham, Shepparton and Geelong. The $9bn state health budget includes $2.8bn in regional health spending. More generally, an increase in the threshold for payroll tax will help about 7000 businesses, many of which have been decimated by the COVID-19 lockdown. Waiving 50 per cent of stamp duty on homes worth up to $1m will help the property industry and home buyers at the lower end of the real estate market. The $5.3bn to be spent on building more than 12,000 public and affordable homes will boost government involvement in the housing sector, which could dampen the market in the event of another unexpected downturn.
As Mr Pallas said: “A year like no other really does deserve a budget like no other.” And he delivered one. The state’s debt is projected to reach $87bn this financial year and blow out to $154.8bn by June 2024. That compares with $104bn in NSW, which operates a larger economy. As Victorians face years of paying it off, they are entitled to ask if the budget spending positions their state as effectively as possible for growth. Apart from the infrastructure and some limited tax concessions, much of it does not. As is Mr Andrews’ wont, much of the spending is about centrism, big government, pandering to public sector unions and social engineering. Victoria’s public sector wages bill is forecast to jump by 21 per cent over the forward estimates, when community wages growth will be about 1 per cent. The astonishing spike in the public wage bill will stem from wage rises and increases in the number of public servants. Public sector employee expenses will balloon by 9.5 per cent this financial year alone.
Even in the best economic times, governments using taxpayers’ money to pick winners and fund make-work schemes are on shaky ground. In a shameless throwback to the days when women were perceived as needing a hand out the door and into the working world, Mr Pallas is putting his hand deep into taxpayers’ pockets to fund the kinds of affirmative action programs socialist feminists demanded 50 years ago. Businesses will receive subsidies for hiring women over the age of 45 — a group of employees highly sought after in normal times. Women will be encouraged into male-dominated trades jobs and would-be female entrepreneurs will have access to a new fund. Those with viable business plans hardly need propping up. After-school care and free preschool will be expanded. The apparent justification for the one-sided approach is that more women (109,000) lost their jobs during the pandemic, from March to September, than men (70,000). That decline largely arose because more women work in the industries that were hardest hit — accommodation, arts and recreation, and hospitality. Economic recovery will revitalise jobs in those sectors. In the interests of jobs growth outside the public sector, governments do best when they step back and create the conditions for entrepreneurs — regardless of gender — to invest. State governments love to spend and recovery from COVID has given them full rein. Victoria is the flag-bearer of “Covidnomics” in Australia, Adam Creighton writes today, “where debt doesn’t matter and feelings govern policy”. But that distinction may be short-lived. Queensland, which clocked up more debt than Victoria or NSW before COVID-19 was heard of, delivers its budget next week.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Coal ships an issue for business	The Australian	The stranded cargoes are the property of Chinese steel mills
The Australian government must tread carefully in efforts to break a deadlock that has seen more than 80 ships carrying $1.1bn worth of Australian coal stranded off the coast of China. It is easy to feel sympathy for the hundreds of international seafarers who have in some cases spent months at anchor with great uncertainty about when they can be reunited with family. But the issue at hand ultimately is one for the companies involved and markets to resolve.
To date, the Australian government has been rightly circumspect in how it has dealt with what appears to be prejudicial treatment of Australian exports. In late November, Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said it was not just a trade issue but an issue about respect and regard for the wellbeing of individuals. Rather than focus on the stranded cargoes, any official involvement by Australia should be directed towards ensuring that China operates within the spirit and the law of the bilateral trade agreements between the two countries.
The issue of the stranded coal exports is complicated by the fact that although the coal was mined in Australia, it has been transported by third parties and ultimately is the property of Chinese steel mills. The bulk of the coal stranded at sea is coking coal used for steelmaking, rather than steaming coal used to generate electricity. Reports of blackouts and electricity shortages in China due to a ban on Australian imports are not directly linked to the stranded ships. Rather, they reflect the fact that Australian exporters have stopped shipping thermal coal to China altogether until the situation becomes more clear.
Unlike China, the Australian government does not direct corporations how they should act. China, no doubt, would like Canberra to intervene to reduce prices for iron ore to ease bilateral tensions. But just as the Australian government has no place getting involved in commodity price negotiations, it should stay well clear of attempting to solve the market access issue with the stranded ships. China’s real negotiations are with its country’s steel mills, which no doubt would like to see the Australian coal landed.
Blocking the imports has resulted in sharply higher prices both for coking coal and thermal coal on the domestic market. Australian producers have already sold the stranded coal. Their concerns are about future sales. China has offered some relief to two ships with predominantly Indian crews following intervention by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But it remains unclear whether once the crews have been swapped, the ships will be required to return to China with its cargoes intact. The latest news is that Beijing authorities have issued instructions that the coal on all 80 ships will not be unloaded and should be re-sold to markets outside China. This is an issue for the steel mills, shipping lines and their insurers to resolve, not government.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Xi’s pitch abounded with irony	The Australian	The subtext of the Davos speech was ‘Do as I say’, not ‘Do as I do’ Taken at face value, it would be hard to disagree with a lot of what Chinese President Xi Jinping told the World Economic Forum in Davos by video link on Monday: “The strong should not bully the weak.” Peace and stability depended on “international law and international rules”. Differences should be bridged “through dialogue”; disputes resolved “through negotiation”. “Selective multilateralism” should not be our option. “Equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules should be strengthened” is something few would argue against. But, we would ask, does such equality extend to China’s oppressed Uighur minority? On trade, Mr Xi said supply chains must not be blocked; an open world economy depended on taking down trade barriers. Australians smarting from China’s relentless pounding in the past couple of years can only wonder if they heard Mr Xi right, Rowan Callick writes.
We have heard him loud and clear, which is why we recognise the brazen duplicity in a performance designed to bolster China’s standing in multilateral forums and pander to the sensibilities of WEF participants as they promote the “great reset” launched at last year’s forum by founder Klaus Schwab and Prince Charles. After the recent transition of power in the US, Mr Xi was intent on asserting China’s role as a world leader. As if on cue, Chinese state media described the speech as a “stern repudiation … clearly aimed at policies orchestrated by the US government”. At Davos four years ago, days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, Mr Xi won applause for defending globalisation. He presented himself as its leader and protector. On Monday he pursued similar themes, interspersed with buzz phrases synonymous with the forum — green development, global governance, consensus building.
But when he briefly steered off his charm offensive, Mr Xi did not hide his hostility towards those who would “build small circles or start a new cold war”. The “small circles” comprise democratic countries now aligning more closely as China advances, including the US-Australia-India-Japan Quad. In this, Callick writes, Mr Xi is striking at Joe Biden’s core shift in foreign policy to revive US alliances.
Mr Xi’s warning that without international law “the world may fall back to the law of the jungle and the consequences would be devastating for humanity” will resonate strongly in this region. It raises some juxtapositions. Since the historic 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration against Chinese claims to large swathes of the South China Sea, Beijing has seemed oblivious to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
After the jackbooted destruction of their freedoms and parliamentary democracy, the people of Hong Kong can only wonder at Mr Xi’s apparent conversion to the value of “international rules, instead of seeking one’s own supremacy” and his professed belief in “peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom”. These, he said with a straight face, must “ rise above ideological prejudice”. His government’s aggressive repressions of the people of Hong Kong, alas, make a mockery of the “one country, two systems” agreements that governed the 1997 handover of Hong Kong and that Beijing’s communist rulers solemnly signed. Nor will his words win over the people of democratic Taiwan. Only hours before the speech, their airspace was breached by flyovers of dozens of Chinese warplanes, as it was throughout last year. Australian producers of coal, barley, wine, beef, wood and lobsters can feel only bemused by Mr Xi’s assertion that China is “working hard to bridge differences through dialogue and resolve disputes through negotiation and to pursue friendly and co-operative relations with other countries on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit”. While produce has rotted and coal ships have remained loaded, Chinese ministers have refused even to return the calls of their Australian counterparts. The terms of Australia’s free trade agreement with China and its World Trade Organisation commitments seem to count for little, regardless of Mr Xi’s claim that “principles should be preserved and rules, once made, should be followed by all”. Nor does his promise that “China will think and act with more openness with regard to international exchange and co-operation on science and technology” sit well with the surreptitious exploitation of Australian and other overseas scientific research under China’s Thousand Talents plan revealed by this newspaper. The speech “overflowed with irony”, as former Singaporean Foreign Affairs Ministry secretary Bilahari Kausikan told The Australian on Tuesday.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
US-China trade deal boosts local market confidence	The Australian	The superpowers’ economic war was a brake on growth
Donald Trump sealing a phase-one trade agreement with China has delivered a temporary truce in the superpowers’ destructive trade war. More difficult negotiations await in phase two. But the breakthrough should be a boost to international economic confidence, a point appreciated by Australian investors who propelled the ASX to its third record-breaking session in a row on Thursday. It surpassed the 7000 barrier within minutes of opening and maintained momentum to close on 7041.8, a gain of 0.67 per cent. The market took its cue from the US Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had lifted past 29,000 for the first time on the optimism generated by the deal.
As Washington correspondent Cameron Stewart reported, the 86-page deal requires China to buy $US200bn more in US goods in the next two years and take steps towards removing unfair trade practices. These include China pledging to give US companies greater access to its financial services, to give greater protection to US intellectual property and to refrain from manipulating the Chinese yuan to assist its exporters. In return the US will cancel planned new tariffs on $US156bn of Chinese goods and halve the 15 per cent tariff on $US120bn of Chinese goods imposed last September. The deal, “which most people thought would never happen” according to Mr Trump, will help him in the lead-up to the November election, allowing him to point to the effectiveness of the tariffs he imposed on Chinese goods. Because the deal includes new purchases by China of $US32bn in US agricultural products it will ease the pain the trade war has caused farmers in swing states.
While it is easy to sneer, as Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden and others did on Thursday, the deal should help alleviate a serious slowdown in the global economy that has threatened investment and jobs. In a statement in The Australian last September, Josh Frydenberg and the treasurers and finance ministers of Canada, Indonesia and Singapore called on the US and China to end the trade war, warning of collateral damage to other nations. “Uncertainty over the outlook is contributing to a slowdown in trade and manufacturing activity,” they said. “We have seen a return of financial market volatility, currency instability and decreased capital flows to emerging economies. Dampened global trade conditions are affecting investor confidence, business investment and productivity … Growth has slowed and risks remain tilted to the downside … we should be clear that protecting free and open markets will ensure stronger growth and greater prosperity for all. We must not resort to unilateralism and protectionism.” For Australia the deal could be a mixed blessing. While a revival in Chinese manufacturing would be a boon to iron ore and coal exporters, China ratcheting up purchases of US dairy, beef and liquefied natural gas exports could cost Australian producers dearly. For all the fretting over the trade war, some Australian exporters have done brilliantly out of it, as Adam Creighton reported on Thursday. The deal is another reminder why Australia must continue to strengthen trade relations with partners such as India, Indonesia, Britain, the EU and, as Creighton wrote on Tuesday, Taiwan.Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a letter to Mr Trump, said the deal was “good for China, the US and the whole world”. But it leaves hard work to be done. Tariffs will remain in place on two-thirds of Chinese imports to the US, affording leverage as negotiators tackle unfair trade and commercial practices, including the theft of US companies’ intellectual property by Chinese companies. Phase two of the process is unlikely to be completed before the US election. As Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said on Thursday, the deal is “a truce rather than a complete elimination of trade tensions between the US and China”. For Australia, he said, its upsides outweigh the downsides.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Bluetooth handshakes to help reopen the economy	The Australian	The task is to expunge COVID-19 while lifting lockdowns
Unlike developed nations such as Britain, France, Italy, Spain and much of the US that continue to battle alarming COVID-19 death rates and caseloads, Australia is well placed to begin resuscitating the economy, while continuing prudent measures to keep the pandemic contained. The opportunity to emerge from lockdown is timely, judging by research released by the Business Council of Australia, which sets out the economic pain inflicted by the ravages of recent weeks.
The EY analysis, Joe Kelly reports, suggests that with existing COVID-19 restrictions lifted after a month, the cost would be 10 per cent of GDP, or $197.3bn. Restrictions have already been in place for slightly longer than that. Pubs, clubs, cinemas, gyms and casinos closed on March 23. Six months of shutdown, lasting until September, EY estimates, would cost $402bn this year — 20 per cent of GDP. A middle-ground approach of three months of restrictions would cost $278.3bn, or 14.3 per cent of GDP.
The Morrison government’s COVIDSafe app, which was switched on at 6pm on Sunday, will give health authorities the chance to conduct all-important contact tracing as Australians get back to work and out and about again. A bridge between lockdown and more normal activity matters. Australia is winning the battle against coronavirus, but we have not won it yet, as Health Minister Greg Hunt said in launching the app on Sunday. Thirteen newly diagnosed patients took the nation’s total of confirmed cases to 6710 on Sunday night, as the number of deaths edged up to 84. The outbreak in Tasmania’s northwest continues. In Sydney’s west, an 82-year-old man became the sixth resident of the Anglicare Newmarch House aged-care facility at Caddens to die of the disease.
In a society that values choice, the Morrison government, wisely, has made the COVIDSafe app voluntary. For good reason, Australians are wary about more incursions by government into their private lives, which is why the government has gone out of its way to reassure Australians about such concerns. Privacy provisions will be legislated when parliament returns next month. Access to app data will be strictly limited to state or territory health authorities for contact tracing, Mr Hunt said. Not even a court order during the investigation of an alleged crime, he said, would allow data to be accessed. And once the coronavirus pandemic is over, all data collected would be deleted. The take-up of the app will reveal how effective such reassurances have been. Any backsliding on those pledges, whenever they were revealed, would be a monstrous breach of trust, unlikely to be forgiven by the public.
The government has been aiming for at least a 40 per cent take-up. It should achieve it. Monday’s Newspoll shows 54 per cent of Australians are well-disposed towards the voluntary app. Without it, the essential tracking and tracing as new cases of the disease emerge would be laborious for health workers, with valuable time lost to stop the vile disease in its tracks. As Mr Hunt says, Australia has had more than 500 cases of coronavirus in which the original source was unknown — be it on public transport, standing in lines, or elsewhere. “Bluetooth handshakes’’ provided by the app will help solve such riddles, allowing for quicker testing and quarantining. As students download the app, its impact on school attendances could be be interesting.
Now that the app is available, the three prerequisites Scott Morrison said were necessary for winding back restrictions are in place. These include extensive testing and the capacity to respond to any surge in cases with sufficient hospital beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment for medical staff. Small, sensible steps to ease restrictions are under way. Queensland, which has 1030 confirmed cases, on Friday will reopen national parks, allow recreational drives, non-essential shopping and family picnics. The easing of restrictions is welcome but makes social distancing more important. COVID-19 leaves no room for complacency. Singapore, which appeared to be on top of the problem, is now in trouble. On Sunday, it reported 931 new infections, mainly among migrant workers living in cramped dormitories. Prominent economists, whose colleagues have questioned the extent of lockdowns, are warning of the dangers of a second wave that would be even worse for the economy. Infected but asymptomatic young people could unwittingly spread the virus as social distancing eases, Citi senior economist Joshua Williamson has warned.Australia is weathering an extraordinary crisis, unimaginable at the start of the year. As our society embarks on recovery, caution in avoiding relapses must be front and centre. As BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott says, kickstarting recovery and rebuilding job security, including for those in danger of being left behind, will depend on how quickly and safely the nation recovers from the pandemic.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Targeted travel boost a good start	The Australian	The taxpayer-funded measures will pick up where JobKeeper ends Being carefully targeted, the Morrison government’s new support package, bankrolling 800,000 half-priced airfares and providing cheap loans to small and medium businesses coming off JobKeeper should produce a good bang for taxpayers’ bucks. When one dollar is spent on an airline ticket, around $10 is spent on the ground and what the tourism industry needs is tourists, Scott Morrison said when announcing the measures. Travellers will enjoy 50 per cent discounts on domestic fares to ­13 tourism-dependent regions, ­such as the Gold Coast, Cairns, the Whitsundays, Alice Springs, Broome, Kangaroo Island and Merimbula. Qantas and Virgin will also receive retention payments to partly subsidise the wages of 8600 international aviation employees and ensure planes are flight-ready in anticipation of overseas travel resuming when the vaccination rollout finishes. That could be further away than late October, unfortunately, with the program already well behind schedule. On Thursday, Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy blamed the slow start of vaccinations on roadblocks put up by European Union countries.
Airline chiefs, for good reason, have emphasised that state ­governments need to back the tourism industry rescue package by not continuing to close borders in the event of COVID-19 outbreaks. Australians have been deterred from travelling interstate, spooked by snap border closures and the prospect of being forced into hotel quarantine at their own expense and inconvenience. As Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce says, the fixation with “zero COVID cases” needs to end. Provided state borders stay open, the multiplier effect on businesses, jobs and communities in regions that depend heavily on tourism should be significant. Targeting the airline industry makes sense, Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director Simon Westaway pointed out: “We need to have a sustainable aviation sector — it’s going to help drive recovery.’’ As with most stimulus packages, the downside is that it has put noses out of joint in spheres that are not direct beneficiaries. Bus companies, hotel operators in capital cities, especially in Sydney and Melbourne, regional centres not in the group of 13 and attractions that cater to day trippers are all demanding more support. Other towns and cities would be added to the initial list of 13 destinations, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said.
Some criticisms of the package are missing the point. NSW tourism operators, for example, claiming it is unfair that airfares to five Queensland centres and just one in NSW are to be subsidised when NSW has kept its borders open, ignore the fact that government support needs to be targeted to areas that need it most. Aviation is one such sector. It is a national concern, as PwC chief economist Jeremy Thorpe pointed out. Federal support targeted at CBDs, he said, would risk “crowding out” tailored measures from state and local governments geared to promoting city fringe and regional areas.
Domestic tourism businesses, which pump more than $100bn into the economy and employ about 611,000 people, continue to rely heavily on JobKeeper ­payments. The new support package is geared to helping many of those businesses, after JobKeeper ends on March 28. The coming months will tell how effective the package proves to be. According to the Tourism and Transport Forum, which has called for a dedicated wage subsidy until the resumption of international travel, the airline package is a “good start” but nowhere near enough to save wider tourism jobs. It anticipates job losses of more than 300,000 this year, after the industry lost 506,000 full-time positions during 2020 because of COVID-19. The bottom line, however, is that taxpayer largesse cannot be unlimited. It is growth, investment and business activity, ultimately, more than government handouts and intervention, that will stimulate travel, especially business travel between major cities.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
The thing about Aucklanders is that, wherever they live, the [... ] [Derived headline ]	The New Zealand Herald	The thing about Aucklanders is that, wherever they live, they think theirs the best part of town. And that means that some people stay put for a very long time, gathering long memories of a gentler time when the city was still surprisingly rural and the roads uncrowded.
The late owner of our house in St John’s bought it in 1951 for his bride-to-be when the area was mostly trees and paddocks, and lived there until he was 102. The stunning modern property in Tindalls Bay was added behind the sweet original bach dating from the days when the 25km trek to the Whangaparoa Peninsula was a summer holiday tradition, not a regular commute. The owners of the classic Devonport villa remember it as a sleepy suburb when they bought 37 years ago.

A ‘phony’ recession still requires real reform	The Australian	The true scale of economic damage won’t emerge until 2021 In the eight months between Britain’s declaration of war on Germany in September 1939 and the German invasion of France in 1940, life proceeded more or less as normal — so much so the calm became known as “the phony war”. For many Australians today, the prevailing recession might appear equally benign, even pleasant. Such is the deluge of federal government support, household income is in fact greater than it was last year and many of us are working considerably less, too. Perhaps younger Australians are salivating at the prospect of a slump in house prices.
“The increase in government benefits payments is massive and has more than offset the decrease in wages and salaries paid,” Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird said on Thursday, based on an analysis of customer bank accounts. Even the increase in the unemployment rate for July turned out much better than expected on Thursday, creeping up by just 0.1 percentage points to 7.5 per cent compared with the 7.8 per cent most economists had expected. To be sure, private sector wages fell by 0.1 per cent across the June quarter — the first time that has happened since the series began. But prices fell by 1.9 per cent across the same three months, delivering a rare increase in real wages for those fortunate enough to have maintained their income.
But dark clouds are on the horizon. And as the government begins the politically painful — but economically necessary — task of dialling down its colossal economic life-support programs, the “phony recession” many Australians have observed as they enjoy working from home will become much more real.
As Adam Creighton and Richard Ferguson revealed on Monday, Australia could see as many as 640,000 jobs disappear during the next six months, on top of the 740,000 already lost up until July, according to new analysis undertaken by consulting firm McKinsey. Retail and construction could lose an eye-watering 200,000 jobs each amid “permanent structural changes” to those two critical sectors.
Dire warnings such as these will test the mettle of the Morrison government, as well as the much-vaunted “scalability” of its economic support measures. On current predictions, federal stimulus spending, including early release of superannuation, is expected to fall from its July peak of $30bn to $23bn this month, and to keep on falling to $14bn in November and $7bn in January before ceasing entirely by May next year. Absent an economic miracle, household income will shrivel accordingly, as the full cost of more than three million workers currently on JobKeeper is foisted back on businesses. As McKinsey suggests, many of those jobs will no longer be viable and the workers will become formally unemployed, bringing the official jobless rate more in line with the “real” unemployment rate, which Roy Morgan puts nearer 12 per cent. Falling house prices won’t be much help to young Australians if they don’t have a job.
Josh Frydenberg is fond of contrasting the government’s “targeted, temporary” measures with Labor’s post-GFC cash splash, which “baked in” spending. We’ll see. Already there are calls for the government to keep the door open to a more sustained and prolonged spending regimen. As Joyce Moullakis reported on Thursday, CBA chief executive Matt Comyn has called on the government to take advantage of record low borrowing costs to keep the struggling economy afloat. The political pressure to extend extraordinary programs will be immense. Regardless, the profound uncertainty of this crisis shouldn’t detract from the government’s responsibility to respond with meaningful economic reform. It merely raises the stakes. As Australia’s “phony recession” recedes and the scale of our nation’s economic challenge is revealed in all its sobering clarity, rebuilding the economy will be government’s paramount task. Success will be measured, for example, by whether it becomes easier for businesses to hire and prosper, whether the hopelessly complex tax and welfare systems provide greater incentives to work. History and voters, ultimately, will not be kind if it shirks this duty.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
After Trump impeachment US needs stability, new start	The Australian	The upheavals should not dominate Mr Biden’s first months in office Donald Trump still does not appear to grasp the ignominy that surrounds him after last week’s violent assault by a mob of his supporters on the Capitol, the heart of US democracy. Ahead of Thursday’s vote, Australian time, in the House of Representatives which awarded him the singular dishonour of becoming the first president in US history to be impeached twice, he spoke contemptuously of the process that convicted him on a charge of “incitement to insurrection” as “absolutely ridiculous”. His speech before the attack on the Capitol, he insisted, was “totally appropriate”. Really? Even some of those closest to him thought otherwise.
Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, one of his most loyal aides, was emphatic: “The President bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on congress by mob violence. What we saw last week was not the American way. Neither is the continued rhetoric that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president.” Following the historic vote for a second impeachment, Mr Trump issued a five-minute video using the @White House Twitter account to condemn the violence. He still could not bring himself to mention Mr Biden or Kamala Harris by name, congratulate them, or say anything that might disabuse his febrile supporters of their belief the election was “stolen”. Mr Trump said: “I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. ‘Making America Great Again’ has always been about defending the rule of law. Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence.” He also appealed to his supporters to “be thinking of a way to ease tensions, calm tempers and help to promote peace in our country”.
Amid FBI and US Secret Service warnings about a potential recurrence of violence when Mr Biden is sworn in on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday (Australian time), Mr Trump’s words might help. But there is no certainty they will, or that the second impeachment, which will be submitted to the US Senate for trial, will not inflame the anger of his supporters further.
While the US constitution gives the House of Representatives the power to impeach a president, conviction requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate. The chamber is currently controlled by Republicans. After January 20 it will split 50-50, leaving vice-president Harris with the casting vote. Numbers are such that the Democrats will need 17 Republicans to break ranks and vote with them to convict. That seems unlikely. Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear the impeachment charge will not be fully dealt with before Mr Biden is sworn in. The trial will take place after Mr Trump has left the White House and is a private citizen. As The Wall Street Journal has pointed out, the US constitution is far from clear that private citizens can be tried in the Senate; Mr Trump’s lawyers would fight, which would drag the matter out for weeks or months.
Democrat senator Chuck Schumer, who takes over from Senator McConnell as majority leader on January 20, has made it clear the goal of convicting Mr Trump will be pursued relentlessly. The Democrats’ aim is to keep the impeachment trial going for as long as possible, maximising damage to the Republican Party and to Mr Trump. Their hope is that if he is convicted by the Senate, Mr Trump could be prevented from ever running for the presidency again, or being allowed to hold public office.
The Wall Street Journal’s view is that after the inglorious end to his term, Mr Trump is “finished as a serious presidential contender — unless the Democrats try to rehabilitate him with a trial that looks vindictive”. That would be unfortunate. After the tumult of the Trump years and the final shame of the attack on the Capitol, Mr Biden faces immense challenges in trying to heal the nation’s wounds while dealing with the COVID-19 emergency resulting from Mr Trump’s grave mishandling of the crisis.
The proposed attendees list of 1000 top officials, to be shielded behind high metal fences and protected by 15,000 heavily armed National Guards, compares with the more than 200,000 people who normally throng Washington for inaugurations. It reflects the pandemic, the deep political and social divisions, and the fears of violence. After the second impeachment, there is no certainty Democrats, flushed by their success in winning the presidency and control of both houses of congress, would be allowed by the constitution to drop the trial in the Senate. Many Democrats and Republicans are deeply offended by Mr Trump’s reprehensible conduct. But vengeance is not the answer to the profound problems the new administration faces. Mr Biden needs to take the high road and get on with his agenda and a return to stability.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Anzac Day to be a healthy sign of post-Covid recovery	The Australian	The virus has not dimmed our dedication to the ‘one day of the year’ The nation’s post-COVID recovery would fall far short of expectations if Anzac Day, the day that unites Australians like no other, did not return to as normal a commemoration as possible next month. Last year — deep in the first COVID-19 lockdown, when an effective, safe vaccine seemed a distant hope — Australians lit up the dawn on Anzac Day, gathering in driveways, on balconies or at windows at 6am to hold up a candle or a light and listen to a streamed Dawn Service from the Australian War Memorial. We honoured our war dead and our veterans under duress, in what was a solemn, moving process. War memorials in cities and towns across the country and on distant battlefields in GallipoIi, Villers-Bretonneux and Hellfire Pass were eerily quiet. Marches and remembrance services were cancelled as the pandemic forced large-scale restrictions. But the eternal flames flickered on. And the spirit of the day was reminiscent of 1919, when World War I veterans returned to face the Spanish flu epidemic.
On Tuesday, Scott Morrison spoke for the nation when he said “I want Anzac Day on’’ this year. It is time to return to the traditional rituals as much as possible — the Dawn Services in centres and marches in communities large and small, and the camaraderie in RSL clubs and pubs as veterans, families and friends enjoy a few drinks, share memories of fallen mates and venture their hands at two-up. As the Prime Minister says: “If people can party and if people can protest then we can remember as a nation, and honour our veterans on Anzac Day.’’ Decisions about crowd numbers and social distancing rest with the states and territories. They, and local RSL branches, should ensure a day that means so much to most Australians is commemorated as fully and as safely as possible, with the public encouraged to turn out. In another six weeks, the vaccine rollout will be more advanced, adding extra protection to hand sanitising and social distancing. On a smaller scale in Sydney on Saturday night, the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade showed what can be done. The event shone brightly at the Sydney Cricket Ground, watched by 36,000 spectators. Nearby, a breakaway street protest, held after NSW Health granted an exemption — provided attendees followed COVID protocols — attracted hundreds of marchers.
War veterans in Sydney were upset, understandably, by the news that the Anzac Day parade was to be capped at 500. Police Minister David Elliott did the right thing on Tuesday, calling stakeholders together. As a result, 5000 people will allowed to march in groups of 500, including members of the armed forces, veterans and their descendants, plus bands. Each marcher will be able to invite two people to line the route of the event, which will finish at the War Memorial at Hyde Park. RSL NSW had been too conservative in its initial plans for the march, Mr Elliott said. RSL Victoria is awaiting approval from the Andrews government to host remembrance services for up to 5000 people, Greg Brown reports, while celebrations will go ahead without restrictions in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland. After containing coronavirus, Australia’s post-COVID recovery is unfolding well in terms of economic growth, investment and jobs. As former governor-general Sir Peter Cosgrove, an infantry platoon commander in Vietnam for the 9th Battalion (9RAR) says, it is time to “get one of our great national days back”.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Grateful for alert level 2 FROM THE EDITOR	Bay of Plenty Times	The weekend’s Thames Valley club rugby finals will go down in history for the way communities backed our local teams despite the restrictions placed on us by a global pandemic.
Watching the joy on the faces of the Red and White team supporters outside the fence at Waihi Athletic on Saturday was gold.
We have to be grateful, because for a while there it looked like we wouldn’t get any winter sport at all. Not even surfing. This week we had sunshine, waves and top notch club rugby on the Coromandel Peninsula.
Grassroots club rugby is alive and kicking here.
Also this week, the Department of Conservation (DoC) marked Conservation Week. Its theme was Healthy Nature, Healthy People, from New Zealand’s Covid-19 lockdowns when people slowed down and looked at their lives and the world around them in different and more reflective ways.
Shaun Robinson, Mental Health Foundation chief executive, says lockdowns mean we need to look at nature with new eyes — outside our windows, in our neighbourhoods.
The same goes with our community clubs, shops and facilities, and ways we can keep these going (see the story on Whangamata Pool on P5 and Rebecca Mauger’s piece on Forget Me Not on P8). It’s not only our natural landscape but our connection with the people in it that helps to heal us when distressed.

Kiwis dig deep	Herald on Sunday	The widespread panic-buying that preceded the nation’s Covid-19 lockdown was not just contained to supermarkets and toilet paper. There was also a major run on garden centres and the gardening sections of hardware stores.
It seems the combination of the fear of running out of food, and having nothing to do, had people reaching for the seedling punnets, with intentions of growing their own at home.
It is likely a proportion of those buyers are gardening novices, indicating a radical turnaround after largely losing the traditional vege plot over past years, and could be a positive element to emerge from the pandemic.
There are few things more satisfying than getting your fingers dirty, planting, nurturing, harvesting and then consuming your own produce.
It’s also a perfect activity for the kids. In fact, given the numbers of children already in the Enviroschools programme, it may be them teaching us new tricks.
For those who snapped up the salad green seedlings, they could be picking the first leaves within this month’s lockdown. Those planting brassica seedlings will have to wait longer, but time is the one thing we have in bountiful supply now.
Rubbish and recycling piling up? Start a compost heap in a corner of the garden and put all your fruit and vege scraps there, plus torn-up paper and cardboard, and your grass and hedge clippings you can no longer take offsite. Sit back and let the good bugs work their magic.
Parsley and coriander gone to seed? Collect it and sow some in a pot on your windowsill Didn’t make it to the garden centre at all — or found empty shelves when you did? Scrape the seeds out of your online-delivered supermarket tomatoes and capsicums, pot up in whatever garden dirt you do have, place on aforementioned windowsill, keep moist and enjoy watching those green shoots appear.
And if your first attempts don’t bear fruit, you’ll still be learning skills, passing the time, and focusing your energy on something relaxing.
Grow on, you know you can!	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Grim resurgence of pandemic	The Australian	The world needs better planning for the next viral challenge The grim milestone the world has reached with more than 10 million confirmed coronavirus cases and 500,000 deaths is a sobering reminder that, with infections still surging, the battle against the pandemic is far from over. As the University of Minnesota’s Centre for Infectious Disease Research and Policy director Michael Osterholm said: “This is one big forest fire that keeps burning and looking for wood to burn, and that happens to be humans. We have months and months to go with this virus yet.” As countries everywhere seek to find the right balance of preventive measures that will keep infections from reaching runaway levels while trying to emerge from painful lockdowns and restart their economies, the extent of the challenge could not be clearer.
This is being seen particularly in the US, which already accounts for 2.6 million cases, 25 per cent of the global total. On just Friday and Saturday last week the country recorded 45,255 and 42,000 new cases, part of big surges across Florida, Texas, California and Arizona — states that have been in the forefront of reopening their economies and trying to get life back to normal. After initially dismissing coronavirus as “flu”, the Trump administration can’t even take much comfort from the fact the 128,437 deaths so far recorded at a rate of 388 per million in the world’s richest and most well-resourced nation is behind Belgium’s record of 840 deaths per million, Britain’s 642 and Spain’s 606. Faced with the new surge, states across the US are reversing their reopenings.
Confirmed infection rates are accelerating across Latin America, too, especially in Brazil, with 1.3 million cases and 57,000 deaths so far. India similarly looms as an enormous challenge, with its vast population of 1.3 billion barely tested yet health authorities already reporting 549,000 cases and 17,000 deaths. Cases in South Africa and across the African continent also are surging, with limited medical resources and little certainty about the pandemic’s impact. Former British prime minister David Cameron has suggested the need for a new global virus surveillance organisation to anticipate and help countries deal with future pandemics. It’s certainly true that COVID-19 and the World Health Organisation’s gross mishandling of the initial outbreak show how ill-prepared the world is for the next pandemic. Mr Cameron’s idea lacks convincing detail and it’s not clear how it could deal with awkward geopolitical realities, but at least it’s a useful reminder that surviving COVID-19 will by no means end the challenge of infectious diseases in a globalised age.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Lessons of Donald Trump should not be forgotten	The Australian	The worst response to mob action is the tyranny of another mob
There is a long way still to go to resolve the incendiary events that have rocked the US in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election defeat. But there are procedures to deal with them that can preserve the dignity of a democracy that remains a beacon of freedom for the world. These processes will best be conducted with legal precision and away from the heat of the moment. The worst response to mob behaviour is the tyranny of another mob that risks making a martyr of Mr Trump. Include in this actions by social media to expunge his legacy and deny him access to the digital public square.
Mr Trump’s behaviour since he lost the election has been outrageous; but the clamour of his detractors to crow, and the interventions of tech giants exercising near-monopoly powers, show the lessons of history have not been learned.
One key lesson is why Mr Trump was able to tap into a deep well of alienation among forgotten voters who became his base. Another lesson is that humiliated leaders with tens of millions of loyal and disenfranchised supporters are best treated with caution. The Democrats have begun moves to impeach Mr Trump, to add humiliation to his election defeat. The charges against the President are of “incitement of insurrection” and, if successful, the Democrats will seek to bar Mr Trump from holding public office again.
Mr Trump’s political opponents have a legitimate right to initiate this process. It is essential that Mr Trump’s actions, and those of his family and advisers, leading up to the storming of the Capitol are fully scrutinised with the forensic dispassion of the law. A chronology of events last Wednesday, published in The Weekend Australian, outlines what appears to be the close involvement of the Trump clan in efforts to derail the confirmation hearings. As thousands of supporters gathered for a “Stop the Steal” rally, the Trump family milled about in a tent on The Ellipse, a park just south of the White House. Rudy Giuliani, the lawyer who spearheaded the attempt to overthrow the election result, exhorted the crowd to “trial by combat”. Donald Trump Jr told them: “You can be a hero, or you can be a zero. Choose wisely.” The President himself told the crowd: “You’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to be strong.” Analysing events of that day, The Wall Street Journal’s Gerald Seib said people acting in the name of one president, and inspired by him, broke into the Capitol building in an effort to stop the transfer of power to the next president. In doing so, they assaulted a building in which the top three people in the presidential line of succession were in the same room. Such a move would be considered an act of war if perpetrated by an outside power. The Wall Street Journal’s view is that Mr Trump’s actions crossed a constitutional line and are impeachable. We agree with The Wall Street Journal that Mr Trump’ s position now is untenable and think he should resign as President and hand over to his deputy, Mike Pence. With just over a week to go until Joe Biden’s swearing-in, a resignation would help restore stability to the office and short-circuit claims that Mr Trump is a victim of circumstance or conspiracy.
Whatever happens, the events of last week do not provide complete succour to those who claim it was inevitable. The fact is 63 million Americans voted for Mr Trump in 2016 and almost 75 million voted for him in 2020 to be returned for a second term. Even if Mr Trump’s behaviour was expected by those who oppose him, events must be treated on the basis of fact, not expectation.
This is where social media groups with a penchant for de-platforming views they don’t like are overstepping the mark. Mr Trump’s behaviour will not disappear simply because he no longer appears on Twitter. He thrives on turning exclusion into validation. Many of his 88 million-strong army of Twitter fans no doubt will follow him wherever he goes. It is better such affairs are conducted in public, or are at least open to general inspection. The alternative is to further feed the politics of grievance that helped to get Mr Trump elected in the first place. The problem for the tech giants is both confusion about whether they are publishers or simply carriers, compounded by their near-monopoly position, which adds a new dimension to their accountability. For Democrats, it would be a big mistake to forget the lessons of Mr Trump’s election because of the fireworks of its termination. It would be jut as foolish to expect that Mr Trump will now start to act like any other politician, exemplified by his refusal to attend the swearing-in of his successor, the first time this has happened for 152 years. To his credit, Vice-President Mike Pence has said he will attend, earning him derision from the President and chants of “Hang Mike Pence” from Trump fans. Mr Pence deserves the gratitude of all Americans for holding things together in Washington, standing up for proper democratic processes, and defying Mr Trump’s unrelenting demands that he use his office illegally to act unconstitutionally. Mr Pence’s courage has enabled the US’s democratic institutions to survive the crisis and reassure worried allies. It is these institutions that will allow the US to deal with the events of last week and move on.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Protest in the time of Covid-19	The Australian	There are many ways to raise our voices for the public good Championing free speech is one of our missions, especially in an era when many powerful forces are allied against it, including foreign governments, university administrators and rampant groupthink in its many dismal guises. Defending the right of people to be heard is not pain-free either, as it often involves giving free air to bad ideas or cranks. Yet there are reasonable limits to what is OK in the public square, especially when the vulnerable are vilified, lives are endangered or activists spruik hateful ideologies. Black Lives Matter is certainly a cause that should be heard and is being heard. The horrible death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May has galvanised the world. But the BLM rally planned for Sydney on Tuesday was always a bad idea. After two adverse decisions in the courts, it was also against the law.
Ahead of the protest, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned the state was at a “very critical point” in managing the COVID-19 outbreak. “It only takes a few cases for this thing to get out of control. We have seen that in Victoria,” she said. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt advised BLM sympathisers the event was inappropriate and dangerous during a pandemic. “I could not be clearer. Please, do not go. Express your views on social media, a silent vigil outside your place of residence, whatever other means, but not gathering in large groups,” he said. In the end people stayed away, although protest leaders did their bit for the TV cameras as they were arrested by police and tore up infringement notices. A bigger turnout no doubt would have done damage to the BLM cause.
Yet a movement without nobility is active in Melbourne, where wearing a face mask in public is now mandatory. A woman who refused to comply with the mask edict, claiming it was against her human rights, confronted store workers at a suburban Bunnings. She recorded the exchange; lowering the tone was just the beginning of her ambush. The video taken by the woman went viral. Who could be so stupid? Another of her ilk was given airtime on the Nine Network’s Today on Tuesday before the presenters pulled the pin on this idiocy. Now another group of coronavirus deniers is planning an anti-mask protest at Melbourne’s Shrine of Remembrance, shamefully trading off the prestige of Anzac. The nutters are spouting dangerous views. As Hunter S. Thompson declared, “when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro”.
Right now, Melbourne can do with less gonzo fear and loathing and more public health compliance to limit community transmission. Victoria’s COVID-19 death toll soared to 63 on Tuesday, with the total number of active cases in the state rising to 4775. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews pleaded with citizens to wear masks. Victoria Police has vowed to fine anyone found deliberately breaching the public health directive of the state’s Chief Health Officer. The Committee for Sydney, a private think tank, is now calling on the NSW government to make face masks mandatory across the city, arguing that doing so will limit the need for a second lockdown and avoid more economic disruption. While Ms Berejiklian and CHO Kerry Chant have encouraged the use of masks, they have resisted making it compulsory. When asked about the coronavirus deniers’ claims of a breach of civil rights on masks, Scott Morrison backed his health officials. “There is no agenda behind public health advice,” the Prime Minister said. “They are simply trying to give us as leaders the best possible expert opinion on how we can keep Australians safe.” Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he? They’re all in it together, right? Actually, they are in cahoots — politicians, doctors and community leaders. The first duty of governments and their officials is to keep people safe. As Mr Morrison said, we also have a collective responsibility to each other in the time of COVID-19. For a short time we may have to give up liberties, large and small, and find new but safer ways to raise our voices in pursuit of the greater public good.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Beware second-wave calamities	The Australian	There is a looming corporate and labour market crunch
In a month Australia will be in winter. Until now we’ve managed to suppress the rate of coronavirus infections well beyond expectations, via early border controls, quarantine and strict social restrictions. Three months ago when we imposed a ban on travellers from China, extending it to Iran and Italy, biosecurity experts believed the best-case scenario would be if 20 per cent of us were infected, or about five million people; with an anticipated mortality rate of 1 per cent, we could expect 50,000 deaths because of COVID-19. Yet here we are with fewer than 6800 cases and just under 100 fatalities. We’ve flattened the curve, although at immense economic cost. Like New Zealand, which aimed for elimination of the virus, we have attracted attention from countries that want to learn from our experience.
But, without a vaccine, we’re not out of the woods. This coronavirus is sly, incessant and lethal. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly warns of a possible second wave of COVID-19. Epidemiologists say there could be second and third waves, deadlier and harder to fight, as with the Spanish flu a century ago. In Singapore, which had early success, the beast is out in the community, with 700 new cases in the past day. Did they get cocky, as some medicos believe? It has forced closure of businesses and schools for four weeks in the city-state.
As authorities here plan an easing of social restrictions and staggered returns for some activities, such as schools and community sport, they will need to be vigilant. Working in our favour is the good progress on three preconditions national leaders have established. First, ramping up capacity in hospital intensive care units, including more ventilators. Second, widespread testing, especially of asymptomatic people. More than 550,000 tests have been completed and officials want 50,000 people tested a day. Third, enhanced contact tracing. The new voluntary COVIDSafe app, based on Bluetooth contacts, will allow infection hunters to work more effectively. The app has been downloaded more than 3.3 million times. The Morrison government is seeking three times that many users to enable an easing of restrictions on “high-value, low-risk” economic activities. While we are sceptical of more state power and worry about threats to privacy, the emergency-level imposition appears warranted.
After shutting down the economy, the Morrison government insists its “whatever it takes” fiscal response to cushion the financial blow for workers and businesses is temporary, targeted and proportionate. We accept it is necessary and sufficient, given national output is forecast to shrink by 10 per cent and the jobless rate will hit double digits. Scott Morrison has used the term “snapback”, not so much to describe a sharp rebound in activity but to emphasise government support is limited and that a doubling of payments is not sustainable. Nor is a loosening in means-testing or obligations on welfare recipients. Still, there is a looming labour market and business viability crunch. Companies will use down time to recalibrate needs and costs; some will thrive but others will disappear. Sadly, as we have seen after earlier economic calamities, many older people will never work again.A second wave of economic dislocation and despair is likely. It’s clear overseas travel bans are going to be in place for some time. The international tourism and education sectors, hit first and hard, won’t have time this year to draw proper breath. If Australians have no choice but to holiday at home, that may help some operators. But universities and colleges reliant on fee-paying foreign students — human cash multipliers who incur living costs and explore the country — will see their revenues plummet. As a nation, we need to be alive to countless disruptive forces at play. That means making changes to the way we work and do business. We need to take the shackles off companies, make it easier for them to expand, invest, innovate, hire and train people. That’s entirely the point of calls for reforms that boost productivity. Alas, this won’t be easy to do in a dire political domain, where mavericks often hold governments to ransom. But the alternative is grim: stagnation, oblivion and unrest in a nation smashed, wave after wave.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Time to end impasse in Israel	The Australian	There is no certainty Benny Gantz can form a government
It remains to be seen whether Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz being given the first crack at forming a new government following the March 2 election really does signal the end of the road for Benjamin Netanyahu, the Jewish state’s longest-serving prime minister. A joint meeting President Reuven Rivlin held with both men after making the announcement of Mr Gantz’s mandate suggests it may not. So does the veteran Mr Netanyahu’s long record of survival against the odds. But what is not in doubt is that after the third inconclusive election in a year, and administration in limbo without even parliamentary approval of a 2020 budget for the purchase of vital military equipment, there is an urgent need for the formation of a stable and effective government.
At their joint meeting, Mr Rivlin again litigated the argument he has made tirelessly throughout the protracted months of political crisis. With the electorate shown in three successive elections to be divided down the middle, he wants them to form a power-sharing government of national unity to deal with the enormous challenges facing Israel, including the coronavirus crisis and the ever-present existential threat posed by Iran. A joint statement said they had agreed their “negotiating teams would meet soon”. It will be a tragedy for Israel if the negotiations fail. Although Mr Gantz has been handed the initial post-election mandate to become prime minister, his path to power is far from certain. In the election, Mr Gantz’s Blue and White party got 33 seats, Mr Netanyahu’s Likud 36. With allies — including, controversially, the support of 15 MPs from the left-wing Arab Joint List — Mr Gantz was able to argue he had the support of 61 Knesset members while Mr Netanyahu and his right-wing allies had 58. Despite being united in wanting to see the back of Mr Netanyahu, some among Mr Gantz’s 61 supporters are doggedly opposed to the formation of a government that relies in any way for its survival on the Arab MPs, who are regarded by many as fundamentally “anti-Israel”. Thus, while Mr Gantz has been given four weeks to form a new government, there is no certainty he can.It will be a pity if the two leaders do not work together to achieve the unity government Mr Rivlin envisages, with each taking turns as prime minister. As Mr Rivlin said, after three inconclusive elections “the public expects to see unity as soon as possible … no one wants a fourth election” that would, most likely, end up in inconclusive deadlock. Israel’s vibrant democracy and the profound challenges that confront the Jewish state deserve better than a continuation of the protracted political crisis that has seen Mr Netanyahu serving as a caretaker prime minister for 12 months and major infrastructure projects and government appointments left in limbo. Israel, and its security, will be the ultimate winner if Mr Gantz and Mr Netanyahu work together to bring an end to the country’s damaging months of political and administrative indecision.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Class action profits out of order	The Australian	There is no such thing as a litigation-led economic revival
The best class action is one that’s prevented. An increase in this kind of litigation is often a sign of problems that should have been fixed or avoided entirely years before. Sometimes, when a large number of ordinary people do suffer serious injury or loss and face complex litigation against deep-pocket defendants, there may be no other remedy than a class action, but the collateral damage of court disputes can be great, and it’s vital to make sure that a class-action system is cautiously designed and resistant to abuse.
The parliamentary inquiry into class-action reform foreshadowed by federal Attorney-General Christian Porter in this newspaper on Wednesday is overdue. Law suits run by profitable transnational litigation funders have been on the rise. The question is how much of this represents an unjustified drag on business viability, a question that goes to jobs and living standards — especially in a coronavirus-battered economy. There are signs that the pandemic itself is seen as yet another opportunity to expand class actions. The task of reviving our economic fortunes will be difficult enough without industry having to contend with rapacious class actions.
In some high-profile litigation, as reported on Saturday in The Weekend Australian Magazine, the financial settlement due to victims of undoubted harm all but disappears in legal costs and fees. It looks like the problem is systemic. When litigation funders take on a class action, the median return to plaintiffs is just 51 per cent, compared with 85 per cent when no litigation funder is involved, according to the Australian Law Reform Commission. One giant of litigation funding, Omni Bridgeway, has reported returns on its investment capital of more than 300 per cent on two Australian-linked funds. This far outstrips returns in the litigious US, and it’s not surprising that global hedge funds regard Australian-based litigation funders as very attractive. As a nation, we welcome investment but the rationale should be to expand our productive capacity.
Australia’s lawyers are just as entitled as everyone else to make a living but it’s logical for the parliamentary inquiry to scrutinise the links between plaintiff lawyers and litigation funders in order to ensure that there is no conflict with the interests of plaintiffs. Class actions are not an end in themselves and lawyers owe an overriding duty to clients and the courts. In these pages on Wednesday, columnist Janet Albrechtsen raised the reasonable question as to whether litigation funders themselves should have a duty to members of a class action, not just a devotion to the bottom line. It’s also worth reconsidering the exemptions that litigation funders enjoy from regulation applying to other providers of financial services. Some of these entities driving the class-action trend in Australia hail from far-flung islands best known as unregulated tax shelters. For our own rules, of course, we are accountable. We have made it too easy to launch a class action and co-opt unknowing multitudes. The onus is on opponents of an “opt-in” system to explain why it should not be adopted.The guiding principle for reform should be that litigation is not the same as justice. The social and economic costs of conflict in court are high. It’s better to invest in training, safer technology and light-touch but effective consumer regulation. A class-action culture is bad news for entrepreneurship, industry and personal responsibility — qualities we desperately need for economic revival.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Wounded Andrews finally settles for the achievable	The Australian	There is nothing to celebrate in any of Victoria’s trials Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews made two overdue admissions following the resignation of the state’s most senior public servant, Chris Eccles, on Monday. On lifting the stifling lockdown restrictions placed on Victorians under emergency powers he oversees, Mr Andrews said: “We will have to make concessions to what is achievable.” He then said: “Being popular or political has never been less important to me.” Victoria and the nation can only hope these comments are substantial and not more spin.
Setting unrealistic goals has got Victoria into its present predicament. Being political has weakened the state’s governing structures and institutions, and now has started to cut a swath through state cabinet and the senior public service. Mr Andrews belatedly is attempting to navigate out of a dead-end alley of his own making. He is paying a long-term price for the short-term opportunity of calling a board of inquiry into the state’s quarantine fiasco to deflect questions and defer judgment. The setting up of the inquiry, in the way it was, was a political decision. It could have been dealt with immediately by admitting that mistakes had been made. Instead, there have been weeks of distraction that have claimed the scalp of former health minister Jenny Mikakos, who has since criticised the Premier’s handling of emergency powers and his evidence to the inquiry.
The inquiry, led by vigorous media questioning of Mr Andrews, forced the resignation of Mr Andrews’ right-hand man, Mr Eccles, as secretary of the Victorian Department of Premier and Cabinet. The contrast is the Ruby Princess disaster in NSW, where the systemic problem was identified quickly and fixed. Mr Eccles fell on his sword after discovering his phone records contradicted his evidence to the inquiry. On the way out he was lauded by Mr Andrews as an outstanding servant to the public whose career had spanned several decades. The Premier welcomed Mr Eccles’ decision to resign as the proper thing to do. The substance of Mr Eccles’ telephone call to police commissioner Graham Ashton that sealed his fate is not known. But the timing coincides with advice to Mr Ashton that private security guards, not police, would be used to guard people in hotel quarantine.
The decision to use security guards is not of itself the problem and it easily might be explained within the culture of the state ALP. What matters is the failure in supervision of private contractors to do the job properly after they had been appointed. The deaths of more than 790 people in Victoria’s second wave of COVID-19 can be traced to failings of the hotel quarantine scheme. There is still much to learn about how the decision to use private contractors was made, by whom, why and whether anyone received an unfair advantage for government contracts involving very significant sums of money. Mr Andrews’ chief of staff has become the focus of new questions that to date appear to have been overlooked by the inquiry.
Mr Andrews’ apparent change of heart on whether Victoria’s lockdown restrictions can be loosened before previously set markers have been met reflects a growing pressure as well as public fatigue and loss of patience by business. In addition, there has been a mixed message from the World Health Organisation on the wisdom of severe lockdowns of the sort imposed in Victoria. WHO coronavirus special envoy David Nabarro said the organisation did “not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus”. “The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganise, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted, but by and large, we’d rather not do it,” he said. The WHO has attempted to backtrack on Dr Nabarro’s advice, which has been its longstanding position, casting further doubt on the UN body’s reliability and competence. Schadenfreude aside, there is nothing to celebrate in any of Victoria’s or the WHO’s trials and tribulations. The havoc being wreaked by the pandemic is beyond politics, and events playing out in Victoria can be described only as a tragedy. Freedoms have been restricted and livelihoods diminished because leaders have been unable to navigate a reality that should have been discovered long ago; concessions must be made to what is achievable. The Victorian experience highlights an unfortunate fact of public life that when bad decisions are made and things go wrong, leaders can be too quick to take things personally. Mr Andrews is using overly long daily briefings to convey a sense of openness. In reality it is more about control. But Victoria’s crisis is not about Mr Andrews, who will be long gone before the full cost of his tenure can be assessed. The brutal truth is that powerful leaders are powerful for only a short time before they are replaced and quickly forgotten. Mr Andrews just happens to be the person in the chair at this particular time.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Flawed bill risks mental welfare	The Australian	There is something unusual going on when a draft criminal law declared essential to protect gay men, lesbians and transgender people from harmful “conversion therapy” generates serious concern among groups as disparate as psychiatrists, physicians, religious leaders, feminists, lesbians and gay men — or at least some of them. That’s the reality as the Victorian government’s bill to outlaw conversion therapy is due to return to state parliament for debate on Thursday.
The concern of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is that poor legislative drafting will leave practitioners uncertain whether perfectly ethical psychotherapy might be misconstrued as unlawful conversion therapy. The effect could be to frighten practitioners so they avoid taking on patients with issues linked to sexuality or gender, both markers of identity that Victoria’s bill seemingly entrenches as immutable. And this would mean members of social groups especially vulnerable to mental health difficulties would end up deprived of cautious and expert professional help. That would be a woeful outcome.
Nobody is arguing that therapy seeking to force some kind of personal identity change should be tolerated. But champions of these new-wave conversion therapy bans throughout the developed world have failed to produce any solid evidence that health professionals today offer these unethical interventions. The old label of “gay conversion therapy”, referring to cruel but bygone attempts to change adult sexual orientation, has been deceptively revived and rebadged. Dr Kerryn Rubin, chairman of the state branch of the RANZCP, has pointed out that the Victorian bill — like its overseas counterparts — conflates sexual orientation with the arguably distinct and more changeable notion of gender identity.
The key risk of conversion therapy bans is their interaction with youth gender clinics, where there has been a worldwide explosion in teenagers, chiefly girls, declaring a new gender identity and seeking irreversible hormone treatment. Following the activist template, Victoria’s bill explicitly says it’s not conversion therapy for clinicians to help those “undergoing a gender transition”. December’s landmark court ruling against the UK Tavistock clinic declared hormonal drug treatment of minors to be “experimental” and has intensified concerns about this medicalised gender change. Conversion therapy bans risk chilling urgently needed clinical debate and limiting treatment options for under-18 gender dysphoria to risky medical interventions. For the sake of vulnerable young people and families, we should be doing the opposite: opening up thoughtful discussion and widening the choice of ethical treatment options, especially if they are less invasive, more effective and safer.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
EDITORIAL More on buses could make them safer	The Daily Post	There will always be people who think the law does not apply to them and feel entitled to take what they want, however they want, from innocent victims.
They couldn’t care less about how they make people feel or the consequences their actions will have on others.
They’re the types of people society could happily live without — but unfortunately, we are yet to find a way to get rid of this toxic behaviour from our communities and, in recent weeks, bus drivers have been the target.
First Union organiser Graham McKean says bus drivers have been abused, punched and kicked, and have been robbed of cash boxes and personal items, prompting them to leave their jobs out of fear for their own safety.
He says another “predator” has approached women drivers, inappropriately touched them and spoken to them inappropriately, while a schoolgirl has also allegedly been sexually assaulted in the back of a bus.
These are all disgusting incidents that should never be allowed to happen.
McKean has recommended to service operator Bay of Plenty Regional Council to remove cash boxes from buses and that security guards do rounds of bus shelters.
These are positive first steps but I think there needs to be multiple measures implemented — and the community has a part to play.
Safety cameras installed in every bus can only be a positive move, acting as another deterrent and an added safety measure for staff and passengers.
But ultimately, I think the community needs to step up and show these people that this behaviour will not be tolerated to ensure our bus drivers, our school children, our elderly, our women and every other passenger can feel safe while using a bus service anywhere in the Bay of Plenty and beyond. How many times a day do we see an empty bus travelling? The lack of patronage on a bus has to be one of the reasons these people feel like they can get away with their disgusting behaviour.
If we had full buses, in turn ensuring dozens of potential witnesses, that would surely deter offenders from targeting bus drivers. If everyone who is able to catch a bus to school, to work or to wherever their destination, commits to using a bus a couple of times a week we will surely see more packed buses. Perhaps we need to reduce the number of buses we have operating, just until using buses becomes a habit for more people? People who think they have the right to take what they want from who they want need to learn there is no place for them in our community, and our community needs to help to educate them of that.

Backing our values while engaging a prickly Beijing	The Australian	There’s more turbulence ahead in our trading with China An Indian ship with 160,000 tonnes of Australian coking coal bound for Japan has been held captive in Chinese waters. India and China have their own problems, but the cargo is also a credible pointer to Australia’s worsening relations with our No 1 trade partner. China’s displeasure with Australia’s sovereign policy decisions has been made crystal clear. Imposts and restrictions, probably of a punitive nature, have been announced on our exports of barley, beef and coal. Wine and international students are also vulnerable markets, and Beijing is developing new African mines for iron ore. At the moment China relies heavily on Australia for supply of this strategic mineral substance. Things probably will get worse before they get better and we will learn the price of our independence.
Former politician and veteran China hand Warwick Smith says Beijing’s stance has shifted from “assertive to aggressive”. Former ASIO chief Dennis Richardson says he believes Australia must expect to stay “in the doghouse for a good two to three years”. A change in the US presidency is unlikely to bring a quick fix. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and former foreign minister Bob Carr are among commentators who have suggested Australia earned Beijing’s ire by seeking to appease the supposedly Sinophobic Donald Trump. But when Trump administration rhetoric went too far, Australia distanced itself. And from China’s point of view, Australia first earned disapproval well before Mr Trump took office. In 2013, we stood up for international law and our regional neighbours following Beijing’s unilateral and destabilising assertion of claims in the South China Sea. This represented nothing new in Australia’s principled diplomacy. It was a response to the gradual ratcheting up of geopolitical rhetoric and power projection by President Xi Jinping. In the same way, Mr Turnbull’s decision to exclude Huawei from our 5G network reflected our sovereign interests, had nothing to do with pleasing Mr Trump and set the pace for Five Eyes nations. As for laws against foreign interference, any Australian government would act in a principled way to safeguard our institutions.
Sometimes our politicians and diplomats may not get the messaging quite right, but it’s clear that Australia is not anti-China. It’s vital to make a sharp distinction between our objection to aspects of Beijing’s behaviour and positive people-to-people ties involving the Chinese people. We have to be especially alert to the predicament of Chinese-Australians, many with direct experience of authoritarian pressure and vulnerable because of their personal and business links to the mainland. They have a part to play in maintaining good bilateral relations at as many levels as possible. Seeking to diversify export markets makes sense. For years we’ve been told that trade and investment with Southeast Asian nations have been underdone, and it may be that sudden uncertainty in China leads to more energetic cultivation of opportunities elsewhere. But this will not be easy or swift. China remains a huge market and we should keep trying to leverage our record as a reliable supplier of Chinese needs. Nor should we assume that there is no internal doubt about the wisdom of Mr Xi’s approach. Supposed to enhance the regime’s prestige, it has led to plummeting levels of trust in China around the world. The postwar global order is in transition, and China might find that a less aggressive stance will bring it the security, prosperity and respect it seeks without riding roughshod over others.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
China’s trade intimidation risks economic self-harm	The Australian	These are dark days for diplomacy and open global systems
Brewers of world-renowned Tsingtao beer, based in the Chinese port city of Qingdao, get their malting barley from Australia, 8000km away. They could buy the annual 200,000 tonnes of grain from Canada, Ukraine or even locally, but there’s a simple reason they choose ours. “It’s the best quality,” a Tsingtao spokeswoman told The Weekly Times in November. Now our barley exporters have been threatened with an 80 per cent tariff from as early as next week, after an 18-month-long anti-dumping probe by China on the basis of alleged subsidies to Australian growers. That’s bad news for drinkers the world over, including China, and our farmers. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham points out producers here are among the most competitive in the world — they embrace technology, follow best-practice farming and get their grain to market at the lowest possible price. “There is no justification to find that Australia’s farmers and barley producers are subsidised or are dumping their product in such ways,” Senator Birmingham said.
We all know what’s going on here. Beijing’s top envoy to Canberra, Cheng Jingye, provided a brutal warm-up a fortnight ago. He warned Australian exports to China, such as wine, beef, tourism and education, could suffer a consumer boycott after Scott Morrison led calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19. Still have doubts? On Monday, Canberra was informed China had suspended the import licences of four Australian beef producers, supposedly over labelling and health certificate requirements. The Trade Minister insists the ban related to “minor technical errors”. “Australia is not in any sort of war,” he said on Tuesday. That’s prudent, the calm, diplomatic language that defuses trouble and shows respect. He seeks to preserve the links between companies here and the partners they work with to get beef on the tables of a wealthy and discerning Chinese middle class.
Such crude boycott bullying is self-defeating for China on many levels, leading to a loss of prestige, suspicion about its motives and reliability, the disruption of supply chains, consumer resentment and estrangement from the fellowship of nations. As well, it makes no sense for a regime that claims the wellbeing of its people is paramount to abandon a united mission to find the source of the virus. So far, this “faceless and flagless enemy”, as Josh Frydenberg put it, has led to almost 290,000 deaths. Wisely, although risking appearing weak in the face of Beijing’s tantrum, Canberra wants to put trade and corona-verite on separate tracks. China cannot want to cruel the iron ore supply its steel mills crave or the coal and gas that fire up factories and heat homes. A deep stoush makes no sense, least of all between nations that have signed a free-trade deal.
Yet these are dark days for open trade and co-operation, with rising protectionism across the globe. Pundits are claiming globalisation has had its day, as nations look to secure with taxpayers’ funds key industries and energy supplies under the banner of sovereignty. We should be wary of drinking the protectionist Kool-Aid ourselves. Last month the Productivity Commission said while our overall level of industry assistance was falling, the drought led to more domestic support for farmers. As well, it noted Australia was one of the most prolific users of anti-dumping measures. The EU has joined the US, Canada and Australia in implementing anti-dumping measures on Chinese aluminium and steel. The roots of Beijing’s serial grievances can be found in such moves, which are legal under World Trade Organisation rules. Yet, as it is showing now, China bends, stretches, ignores and cherry-picks the rule book at whim, using its economic might to bluster, bully and badger its way through global commerce.In whatever form it takes, protection is not a winning strategy for us. With a mid-sized population and a continent to develop, we rely on foreign capital. We sell bulk commodities, safe food, and unique travel and learning experiences, and use our brainpower, to pay our way and, hopefully, lift our living standards. More than one-fifth of all the goods and services we produce here is exported — no small beer for a nation committed in principle and action to an open, free and fair global trading system. We must hold our nerve in the face of these and other unseemly provocations under the shadow of COVID-19 and its human and economic miseries. If there is gain in the pandemic pain, it comes with a warning and a promise. The pandemic is teaching us that we need to diversify our markets, hold fast to our values and always keep faith in our world-beating producers and workers.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
It’ s time to maximise the nation’s economic recovery	The Australian	Things are looking up, but governments still must manage carefully
The signs are promising that the national economy is starting to emerge well from the self-imposed recession engineered to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. A rebound in jobs, company profits and the sharemarket performance of the top 200 listed companies are all positive signals. The challenge ahead is for government to skilfully withdraw the support that has helped to keep things afloat, so the job of debt reduction and budget repair can begin.
Withdrawing support no doubt will open the way for opportunistic politics from forces keen to see welfare spending continue to grow. Already there are signs of where this may lead if governments fail to show the necessary spending restraint. Credit ratings agencies have sounded the alarm on Victoria’s latest budget, warning the nation’s second-largest state could be stripped of its AAA rating within weeks.
The challenge for the Queensland budget on Tuesday is to resist Victoria’s profligate example and follow instead the more sober fiscal housekeeping of the Berejiklian government in NSW. For Queensland, which already has lost its AAA credit rating, the devil will be in the detail. The state’s Treasurer, Cameron Dick, says new borrowing will be “significant but reasonable”. With interest rates low, now is indeed a good time for governments to borrow for much-needed infrastructure spending. More worrying, however, is the temptation of Labor governments in Victoria and Queensland to lock in heavy recurrent expenditure to fund a bigger and more bloated public sector workforce.
At a national level, all of the signs suggest that recovery from the worst downturn since the 1930s is gathering pace. The JobKeeper scheme, the federal government’s major response to the pandemic, will cost less than the budget forecasts from Treasury. As Patrick Commins reported on Monday, more than two million Australians stopped receiving JobKeeper payments in October as a result of increased business activity and tighter eligibility rules. Treasury figures show the cut left 1.5 million workers still relying on the emergency benefit. Josh Frydenberg confirmed that 700,000 employees and sole traders were taken off JobKeeper in October because their employer no longer met the required decline-in-turnover test. The Treasurer has pledged to maintain strong fiscal support measures until the unemployment rate is comfortably below 6 per cent.
Falling demand for JobKeeper and other measures is good news. It is followed on Tuesday with confirmation that rebounding sales in the hard-hit industries are starting to flow through into higher profits. The sharemarket has responded with the ASX 200 index of the 200 largest listed companies recording its best monthly rise since it began. It is possible that a hoped for V-shaped recovery out of the pandemic shutdown is starting to appear. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, company gross operating profits lifted another 3.2 per cent across the September quarter. The latest increase is on top of a big rise the previous quarter, helped by strong government support. Most promising is the news that sectors hardest hit during the June quarter shutdowns had recorded the strongest lift in sales and profits three months later. ABS figures show accommodation and food services sales were up by 42 per cent, with arts and recreation revenue climbing 27 per cent.
A slowing in emergency withdrawals from superannuation funds is further evidence the worst may now have passed. A total of $35.3bn has been withdrawn under the COVID-19 early release scheme, with only $146m paid out across the most recent week to 20,000 fund members, one of the lowest weekly amounts recorded. Wednesday’s national accounts, meanwhile, are tipped to show the national economy has rebounded out of recession.
The lifting of border restrictions, particularly in Queensland, ahead of the coming holiday season is further cause for optimism. Looking ahead, a successful international rollout of COVID-19 vaccines hopefully will underpin a return to international travel some time next year. This in turn will enable a restart of the high levels of immigration that have helped to underpin Australia’s prosperity. Australia’s success in coping with the pandemic relative to other countries no doubt will boost its reputation as a safe and desirable location. On the downside, rising trade tensions with China as well as the international financial impact of the pandemic make it difficult to predict the economic future with any certainty. The federal government must navigate the broader international relationships. This includes China’s belligerent assertion and the change in administration in the US. The primary task must be to maintain discipline in the domestic economy. There is a concern that, once freed of the constraints of fiscal discipline in the name of emergency, governments risk becoming addicted to spending money they don’t have. While celebrating the positive signals, the challenge remains to maximise the economic recovery while pulling back on interventions that have served the nation well but already have imposed a heavy cost on future generations of taxpayers.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Crunch time for our universities	The Australian	This is a once-in-generation chance to reconfigure higher education Federal Education Minister Alan Tudge has asked for good ideas on how to boost collaboration between universities and business. “We want our high-quality research to better translate into the breakthrough products, new businesses and ideas we need to grow our economy and improve our society,” Mr Tudge said last Friday in his first major speech on higher education. His department’s consultation paper points out that Australia lags internationally in commercialisation of research, campus start-up companies and innovative projects that draw together university researchers and corporate staff.
None of this comes as a surprise. What’s new are the threats — and opportunities — confronting our universities. The complacency of universities about their over-reliance on fees from international students has been shaken by COVID-19 and the deep diplomatic chill with China. Huge public debt and the need not to burden the private sector-led recovery after the pandemic mean governments cannot and should not plug the hole in higher education finances. The sector has long had a weak grasp on political reality, but a new assertiveness from university chancellors, many with strong corporate backgrounds, also may help create conditions for some fresh thinking about the path ahead.
Universities have been fixated with research of the kind that bumps them up the international rankings, which in turn attracts the fee-paying students from overseas who subsidise the costs of that research. In some cases the result truly is world-class research, but it’s by no means always clear that the work rewarded by rankings is of high quality, let alone utility. There is lively debate about the gaming of university league tables, the failures of peer review, academic fraud and the inability to replicate key findings.
This has to be kept in mind when universities respond to Mr Tudge with their familiar complaint that research never gets sufficient support come budget night. Their argument is that unless research is properly funded in the first place, there won’t be much to commercialise. They make the legitimate point that in promoting applied research, we shouldn’t lose sight of the inherent value and often unpredictably useful nature of basic, curiosity-driven research.
But something has to give. We have too many universities all posing as comprehensive research powerhouses. There are pockets of excellence scattered across research fields and institutions. Strategic rationalisation, not simply crude mergers, is long overdue. With the right policy and incentives, in the next decade there could be a reconfiguration with competing, more specialised university models — some heavily committed as industry hubs, some teaching-focused institutions — and a more rigorous curation of basic research alongside more successful commercialisation. Australia has some standout areas such as health and medical research, earth sciences, marine science and solar power engineering. We need a clearer delineation between strategic strengths, sovereign capabilities and areas of mediocre quality and less significance where research funding can be diverted.
The social sciences and humanities need close attention. They are still home to some first-rate scholarship but the rise of “grievance studies”, reducing complex societies to crude power struggles between identity tribes, has corrupted standards and made higher education a source of cultural conflict, not social remedies. Universities are in denial about this, but the government should consider better uses for the funding consumed by low-value activist research, and offer incentives for liberal arts programs. When it comes to commercialisation, it’s true the universities are not alone in having to do better. Australia’s private research and development is weak, and that’s unlikely to be entirely because of unreceptive universities. Mr Tudge’s expert panel will need to think about intellectual property law and the tax system, as well as measures to help develop research ideas to the stage where the commercial world can take over. None of this is easy, and it will require clever policy, effective incentives and patience at a time of distracted government.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
EDITORIAL	Bay of Plenty Times	This week was another stunner on the Coromandel. How can you not be feeling good about where you live, when we’ve had the surf, the live music and the entertainment on offer?
It seems half of Auckland had the same idea about the best place to be right now ... as the traffic queues unfortunately proved on Monday.
Cars were backed up from Tairua almost to Whenuakite at one point after the Whitianga Summer Concert, which drew 16,000 people, and this was just one of the attractions of Whitianga and our east coast Coromandel towns.
The Kopu-Hikuai had an insanely long queue and it carried on to Waitakaruru according to those reporting from the road.
I feel for those stuck in hot cars. Maybe some might consider making their bach a permanent home so they can avoid these sorts of holiday weekend nightmares?
There was so much going on that we’re going to have to hold a few stories for next week’s Coastal News, which is always a difficult decision to make.
It was a pleasure to meet some of the locals featured in this week’s paper, like Kathy and Sinclair of Whangamata and to catch up again for a chat with the wonderful Brant Robinson who celebrated his 102nd birthday.

EDITORIAL Campaign promotes shop local	Bay of Plenty Times	This week we publicise a campaign that was launched by hard-working local women retailers with the sole purpose of inspiring Waihi people to support, and shop, local.
The phrase “Local is the New Black” is a play on the famous fashion phrase that highlights the popularity of the colour black in fashion.
In the time since these Waihi retailers put their Local is the New Black banners up in stores, the terrible reality for many black people living in fear in America came to a head.
George Floyd was an unarmed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes as he told them, “I can’t breathe”.
Floyd’s death sparked protests across the US, with demonstrators desperately calling for an end to police violence.
The tragic death of George Floyd resonated with us in New Zealand.
Some retailers involved in the campaign rang me after I took photos for their shop local-inspired campaign, worrying that some might misconstrue the message as somehow lessening the impact of the campaign sparked by Floyd’s death - that black lives matter.
Sadly, there are opportunists who will twist meanings. For anyone who might jump to criticise the unrelated use of the word black, maybe it’s instead an opportunity to have a conversation about how prevalent racist attitudes are here in our backyard.
In the Waikato, phrases like “Go back to your country” or “Take coronavirus back with you” are among racism levelled at some residents during the lockdown.
Jenny Nand, chairwoman of Fijian Indian young professionals group Aks Collective, says racism escalated nationally during the pandemic, with isolated cases of online abuse and racism seen on Facebook and Twitter under the guise of freedom of speech.
Creative Waikato chief executive Jeremy Mayall believes an arts-led response is the way to educate and unite and quickly launched an arts campaign expressing the importance of kotahitanga: unity in the community.
It will feature 10 artists’ commissioned works for the Waikato.
“Creativity and unity are vital parts of a thriving and innovative society. We need to remind each other that we are paving a new way together, and that a diverse and inclusive
Waikato is the Waikato we want to step into,” Mayall says.

FROM THE EDITOR	Bay of Plenty Times	This week, community board meetings were held in Pāuanui and Whangamatā.
Around 10 people attended at Tairua-Pāuanui’s meeting and 30 came to listen to, or address, the Whangamatā Community Board on Tuesday.
Most were at Whangamatā to share views on a boardwalk that TCDC plans to build on sand dunes.
The speakers got three minutes each in the public forum — some managing to encapsulate a lifelong love of Whangamatā beach in that time.
There was Taff Kennings, who’d surfed here for 55 years, Paul Shanks who rebuilt the dunes as a council contractor after massive storms had wiped them out — and who’d just returned from Wellington in his role as President of New Zealand’s Surf Break Protection Society.
Another speaker had a grandfather who established the Whangamatā Surf Lifesaving Club. There were professors, lawyers, planners and “just a general member of the public” who told the board that exercising in nature is not only catering to physical needs, but spiritual and emotional too.
“That beautiful beach is a way to connect people without a manmade structure,” she said.
More than 410 formal submissions have been received and the board will hear the analysis at its 31 March meeting, and so far there are many in favour of the boardwalk according to submissions.
On Monday Mayor Sandra Goudie spoke to me about the average 10 per cent rates rise that we are facing as a district.
The Ten Year Plan is a chance to decide what projects should be carried out and what we cannot afford if we want to keep rate rises to a minimum, she says.
With unbudgeted projects popping up, competing priorities from different settlements, slipped timeframes and no cap on the maximum rates rises that councils can levy, meaningful feedback on how to save costs might be a stab in the dark.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
We must not forget lessons learnt in 2020	The New Zealand Herald	This year is one many of us may choose to forget but for business there are some important lessons to remember.
As Covid-19 spread around the world, people were forced to adapt to working from home.
For some their life improved immeasurably. The daily commute was gone. Health, happiness and overall quality of life improved. Many were happy and better off to continue working from home.
For others, they couldn’t wait to get back to the workplace.
Lockdown with a young family was no walk in the park. The novel practicality of Zoom quickly wore thin.
The jury is still out on productivity, but in certain circumstances the power may have shifted further toward the organisation and away from individual workers – with managers hard to get hold of, fewer one-on-one meetings and a diminishing team ethic.
What lockdown did prove is that we are a resilient bunch and most businesses were able to adapt under ridiculous circumstances.
On the downside, what Covid highlighted starkly is this country’s concerning labour shortage.
Who would have thought, for example, that our fishing industry had to rely on imported Russian workers?
The same goes for teachers, fruit pickers, construction workers, sheep shearers ... the list goes on.
The Government must find ways to encourage locals into seasonal work, while also investing in training initiatives to build industry skills for other core services.
On the upside, Covid also showed how resilient and constructive capital markets can be.
The crisis has been so severe and unprecedented that the response by governments and central banks also had to be unprecedented in size and scale. But companies and their lenders and investors stepped up, raising capital early and cleanly.
That Auckland International Airport was able to go to investors and raise $1.2 billion when its business model had been torn apart almost overnight was testament to how well-functioning the capital markets are.
Covid also taught us that most predictions are pointless. How does one begin to reconcile the steepest GDP contraction since records began in New Zealand with the way the financial markets have behaved this year?
Meanwhile, businesses were prompted to predict future revenue loss in order to collect the Covid-19 wage subsidy. Some took advantage of it, but most were thankful for the lifeline for their staff.
When lockdown restrictions came off, businesses were then asked to predict their future revenue gains, do the right thing and pay it back.
Looking back at the year suggests New Zealand got most things right. But there are still plenty of things we could do better.
Taking stock of the lessons learned from the Covid-19 crisis is not only important for recovery but also to prepare for the next major global crisis.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Cautious hope in Afghanistan	The Australian	Time will tell if the Taliban severs links with terror groups
After 18 years of interminable conflict in Afghanistan, hopes surrounding the seven-day “reduction of violence” goodwill truce Donald Trump has agreed with the Taliban are clear. According to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, if the agreement holds it will be followed on Saturday by a historic signing of “a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire and the future political road map for Afghanistan”. An immediate start would be made on the drawdown of US troops from 13,000 to 8600 in the following 135 days.
After protracted negotiations in Doha, US officials regard the plan as the best hope for years in a war-torn nation racked by violence for 40 years, dating back to the mujaheddin and the ignominious defeat they inflicted on Soviet forces. But as the US President seeks political advantages from bringing troops home ahead of the November election, he should not forget Barack Obama’s grave mistake in Iraq in 2011 when he rushed for the exits to get all US troops out for electoral reasons. The result was the growth of Islamic State, the caliphate and the escalation of Islamist terror.
In the agreement to be signed, the Taliban reportedly will renounce its longstanding links to al-Qa’ida and other terror groups. Talks on Afghanistan’s future will be convened between the Taliban and a committee to include members of the Afghan government and civic leaders.Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani, recently re-elected in a bitterly disputed election, supports the plan. But just as there are doubts about the Taliban leadership’s goodwill and its ability to control thousands of committed jihadists, there are also serious doubts about the capacity and discipline of the Afghan army, despite years of training by the US and its allies such as Australia. Even some of Mr Trump’s close allies fear potential chaos following an early withdrawal of US forces. Should the Taliban resume its push to retake control of Afghanistan and re-establish its terrorist-supporting dictatorship, Mr Trump must be prepared to halt the drawdown.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Pushing envelope for recovery	The Australian	To restore jobs, we must choose reform and open borders
Josh Frydenberg described the May labour force statistics as a devastating set of figures. In two months, the number of jobs liquidated was 835,000. People are abandoning the labour market. If the participation rate had stayed at its pre-pandemic highs, the unemployment rate would be 11.3 per cent rather than 7.1 per cent, which is bad enough. At the end of the previous deep recession, Australia’s jobless rate was 11 per cent. It prompted straight-talking, if discreet, Treasury secretary Ted Evans to famously declare in October 1993 “for the nation as a whole, the level of unemployment is a matter of choice”. As Paul Kelly explained in an April obituary, the late Evans meant the level of unemployment was just as much a political decision as an economic one and depended to a large extent on decisions politicians took about labour market flexibility.
On Thursday, Scott Morrison went close to pledging to carry the “whatever it takes” spirit of keeping a COVID-addled economy on life support beyond the September cut-off dates for the new JobKeeper wage subsidy and JobSeeker booster shot. Not that the Treasurer is planning a fiscal splurge in next month’s economic statement. Rather, with a record 20 per cent of the labour force unemployed or seeking more hours than they can get, the transition will be delicate and require further income support for workers in the most-affected industries, with young people and women likely to need extra help. That’s the demand side. But the Prime Minister argued his five-year supply-side JobMaker plan would be the key to clawing our way back to the pre-crisis growth trajectory.
Mr Morrison declared he would be “pushing the envelope” on reforms, with the goal of lifting growth in gross domestic product to 3.5 per cent, or by one percentage point above our long-term rate. He has set an ambitious, perhaps unrealistic, metric by which his performance will be measured, as well as a context for the supply-side fixes his executive must bed down. No doubt the likelihood of passing legislation on cutting red tape, industrial relations flexibility and lower company tax, if it will ever get to that, remains a severe constraint. That’s what Evans meant about unemployment being a choice. We hope Labor and the Senate crossbench will reflect on that when the crunch comes later this year. But it should not deter the Prime Minister and Treasurer from being bolder, with the reformists’ mantra “if not now, when?”, and arguing for policies that incentivise businesses to expand, invest, innovate and hire people.
The government also is hoping the five working groups of employers and unions on workplace reform will find common ground to, among many matters, reduce the number of awards and their complexity; speed up deal-making processes and aid compliance; and improve greenfield agreements and those covering casuals. JobKeeper is not perfect but it has kept three million workers in touch with their employers. The economic emergency, by necessity, has seen co-operation and more flexibility in the way work gets done. It has been a quiet triumph of common sense and purpose. Mr Morrison said this mindset would be vital in recovery because too-rigid systems would mean people needlessly losing jobs in the tricky transition in the latter part of the year and beyond. That same spirit also should guide the national cabinet, charged with raising skills levels and reforming federal financial relations. This leads us to the reopening of the economy and the issue of borders. As Rosie Lewis revealed on Thursday, border closures and the clampdown on interstate travel are costing nearly 5000 jobs a week and shrinking GDP by $84m a day, according to modelling for the Australian Tourism Industry Council. Queensland is the worst- affected state but is reopening its border on July 10. South Australia is letting in some people before fully reopening in a month. NSW, Victoria and the ACT never closed their borders, while Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory remain in limbo. Tourism operators are right to argue we are “living in a state of confusion”. The medical advice has been clear, so again, this dislocation is a matter of choice. As Mr Morrison put it bluntly: “If we want Australians back into jobs then we need Australia open.”	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
COMMENT Chance for older people to take lead	The Northern Advocate	Today marks the International Day of Older Persons, a life stage given a unique slant in the year of Covid.
While older people in New Zealand face their own problems, we also have an opportunity to help the younger generation see a future they are struggling to envisage.
The definition of an “older person” is subjective, but for the purpose of this column let’s talk about those aged 60-plus. Covid has seen the retirement plans of many disrupted through job loss and plunging interest rates.
Those recently made redundant may not find another job before they become eligible for NZ Superannuation at 65, and not all older people were financially secure in the first place. Those still earning may be supporting their children for a second time — we’re hearing anecdotally of parents helping to pay the mortgages of children who have lost their income. This may impact the parents’ retirement savings meant to support them in the long-term.
In the meantime, those savings may be languishing in the bank on rock-bottom interest rates if those doing the saving are wary of the riskier investments.
But even if those aged 60-plus are feeling anxious, overall most are the best off of any generation in New Zealand right now.
Most have a home mortgage-free, and a good proportion are still working.
The universal nature of NZ superannuation means all will benefit as soon as we hit 65.
In contrast, we found 34 per cent of younger households in difficulty and 40 per cent at risk of falling into hardship.
They are the ones with mortgages, young children, and may have had insecure work. Worryingly, they are also reacting in a way that is not helpful financially long-term. This devil-may-care attitude could be due to an inability to see past their current problems.
This is where the older generation comes in. We’ve lived through more than one financial crisis. Covid has wreaked more havoc than most financial shocks, but this too shall pass.
It is up to we older New Zealanders to wrap around our younger generation and reassure them there is a future worth saving for.

EDITORIAL	Wanganui Chronicle	Today we enter the second half of a four-week lockdown in our fight against Covid-19.
Hopefully, we’re over the hump.
Whatever happens at the end these four weeks — whether the lockdown is extended or we can begin to open up again — we are closer to the end than we’ve ever been since we retreated into our bubbles on March 26.
By all accounts we’re doing a great job.
At seven, the number of Covid-19 cases in the region remains low and there has been no new case for almost a week.
This is a direct result of the sacrifices we are all making by sticking to the guidelines.
But rather than be complacent we now need to be even more vigilant.
Health officials say the numbers are likely to peak over the next week and the only way to keep it low is to eliminate community spread.
If we can do that we’ll be in a good position to get back to our normal lives sooner rather than later.
What more motivation do we need to continue to do this?
This isn’t just about the virus itself.
The measures taken to keep it under control have already had a significant impact on our community with lost income, lost jobs, cancelled events and huge disruption to our lives. Many have been affected badly.
We need to be able to pick up the pieces and help each other rebuild as soon as possible. The sooner we can get out of this, the easier that will be.
That’s why we need to stick at it over the next few weeks.
It means we need to strictly follow the guidelines and continue to stay home unless we are on essential business such as going to the supermarket or pharmacy, to work at an essential job or for some exercise in your local area.
That’s going to be a bit tougher as the days go on and we hit a significant long weekend where many of us would usually be taking off on holiday, hitting the beach or hanging out with mates.
We can’t.
But we can continue to adapt and find ways make the most of the situation like many whose stories we’ve told over the past two weeks.
We need to continue to do this and look after each other as a community.
To borrow words from the images we’ve chosen for today’s front page; Chin up, Whanganui. Kia kaha.

IR blueprint points back to the future for Albanese	The Australian	Tougher rules, less flexibility is the ALP plan for the workplace
As pressure builds for the federal ALP to reconnect with voters and break its entrenched pattern of electoral failure, Anthony Albanese has turned back to the future with an industrial relations promise of greater regulation and less flexibility. In a detailed speech to be delivered in Queensland on Wednesday, the Opposition Leader uses modest reforms proposed by the Morrison government to reanimate the ghost of John Howard’s Work Choices of more than a decade ago. He accuses the Morrison government of cynically using the pandemic to launch a full-frontal attack on pay, conditions and job security. Declaring Labor will always be on the side of workers, Mr Albanese rails against what he regards as the unfair treatment of fast-food delivery drivers in the gig economy.
In a series of eight elements, Mr Albanese details a blueprint to re-regulate the labour market to combat what he considers the tyranny of casual work. Under Labor, the term job security would become a key objective of the Fair Work Act. Workers in the gig economy such as Uber drivers and fast-food delivery workers would be given rights through the Fair Work Commission. There would be portable entitlements for workers in insecure industries. Casual work would be defined in law, and a crackdown on labour hire firms and a cap on back-to-back short-term contracts for the same role would be imposed. Mr Albanese promises an audit of employment in the Australian Public Service. As a result, the public sector would have more full-time workers and fewer temporary contracts. Government contracts would favour organisations that prioritise secure work for their employees.
Overall, the proposals would strengthen the hand of the FWC to become the centre of the workplace relations system. The FWC would have extended powers to include “employee-like” forms of work and to make orders for minimum standards in new forms of work. The Registered Organisations Commission and the Australian Building and Construction Commission would be abolished.
Delivered in the must-win Labor state of Queensland, the speech sets a clear path of conflict with the government Mr Albanese no doubt believes will carry him to the next election. Work Choices is mentioned twice and the immediate battle lines are drawn around the government’s plans to abolish the “better off overall” test in legislation now before parliament. The government and employers have accused the ALP of misrepresenting the scope of the proposed changes that will apply only in limited pandemic-related instances. But it is enough for Mr Albanese to declare Labor “will never support any legislation that undermines the pay, conditions and security of Australian workers”. Given recent commentary on Labor’s lack of electoral performance, the return to a Work Choices-style campaign is significant. Insecurities about Work Choices, pushed along by a big-spending ACTU campaign in 2007, helped Labor defeat Mr Howard. It was the last time the ALP was successful in winning government from the Coalition.
As Peter van Onselen wrote on Saturday, the Labor Party has lost seven of the past nine federal elections and managed to form majority government only once since its 1993 win under Paul Keating. That was Kevin Rudd’s 2007 victory. Former ALP national president Stephen Loosley wrote on Monday that “it’s a sad reflection on federal Labor that in 120 years of Federation, ALP governments only have occupied the Treasury benches for approximately a third of the time”. Mr Loosley correctly asserts that Labor has been fighting the wrong enemy in the Greens, at the expense of its traditional blue-collar base. He says federal Labor has to offer a coherent and consistent message as to what it definitely represents.
In a new book to be published this month, climate spokesman Chris Bowen accuses charismatic politicians from the right such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson of poaching the centre-left’s heartland of workers with fears about job security. As Troy Bramston explained on Tuesday, Mr Bowen argues that Labor must recognise the anger in suburbs and regions over future jobs, declining industries, rising inequality, dying towns and hollowed suburbs. Labor must provide policy responses. Mr Bowen might be misreading the experience from the Howard years when he says messages of social mobility and merit-based advancement do not resonate with all voters. And it is difficult to support his assertion that social media dishonesty, weaponising identity politics, hyper-partisanship, and fear and loathing over climate change are the preserve of the conservative forces. However, drawing from the reform legacy of the Hawke-Keating era, Mr Bowen correctly says Labor needs to better articulate the benefits of freer trade, immigration and global engagement. These do not appear in Mr Albanese’s IR blueprint. Rather than embrace greater flexibility to encourage jobs and grow the prospects for work, Mr Albanese’s remedy is to throw a wider, stricter net to codify the relationship between capital and labour. Outside the public sector, the unintended consequences of what Mr Albanese is proposing would be the opposite of what he says Labor is seeking to achieve.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Debate is a cure, not a malady	The Australian	Troubled teenagers in gender clinics deserve the best care
The “dear minister” letter from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians powerfully reinforces the case for open and rigorous scrutiny of youth gender clinics, not that the college realises this. In a brief response to a request for “urgent” advice from federal Health Minister Greg Hunt back in August, the college admits these clinics give vulnerable young people life-altering treatments based on evidence weakened by “gaps” and “limitations” with no prospect of data on long-term outcomes any time soon.
The college warns of “danger” and “harm” — not from these novel “gender affirmative” treatments but from a national inquiry. Why? Because journalists would report the inquiry, and the public would pay “attention”. And this, the college claims, would harm the clinics’ young patients diagnosed with gender dysphoria (or distress at being “born in the wrong body”). The college was asked to give evidence for this claim, and failed to.
The college put itself in a difficult position. In 2015, it joined the identity politics campaign to reduce judicial supervision of opposite-sex hormones for under-18s. In 2018, it lobbied for taxpayers to fund controversial puberty-blocker drugs. So, the college had been promoting the treatment it was asked to review, and now admits the evidence for it is patchy.
Evidence is the key in the global debate about the safety and ethics of the affirmative treatment model applied by youth gender clinics. There are inquiries overseas, and former gender clinic staff are among the experts raising the alarm. The college’s letter ignores this debate, and also the emergence of “detransitioners” who say the clinics showed little interest in the non-gender causes of their distress.What is the “clinical best practice” for responding to this global surge of troubled teenagers? That’s what the minister wanted to know. The college offers a vague endorsement of the affirmative approach, saying “social or medical” transition may be necessary. It does not even mention the hormonal or surgical treatment involved, let alone consider whether more cautious, less invasive therapy might be wiser. Yet the college’s unhelpful letter has been hailed by affirmative clinicians as if it dispels any doubt about treatment, and even underwrites their claims for more public money. This only confirms the need for a full and proper inquiry.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Countering Beijing’s aggression	The Australian	Trump administration’s clear warning on South China Sea
Four years ago the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague flatly rejected Beijing’s claims of sovereignty over virtually the entire South China Sea. But that time lag does nothing to diminish the significance of the Trump administration’s action now in formally declaring the claims to be “completely unlawful” and explicitly warning that “the world will not allow Beijing to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire”. Amid rising tensions, with rival naval deployments, including US aircraft carriers, tailing each other across the sea, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s forceful denunciation of Chinese “bullying and intimidation” will enrage Beijing. His declaration abandons the official diplomatic US position of neutrality over China’s claims. Like Australia, Washington has long maintained sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea should be resolved through international law, particularly the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, without taking sides.
Mr Pompeo’s declaration robustly aligns the remaining superpower with the countries of Southeast Asia — Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and The Philippines — in defending themselves against militaristic Chinese bullying. Few strategic moves by the Trump administration at this time could be more significant, particularly for the nerve-racked small nations that have felt increasingly alone in attempting to confront Beijing’s shameless attempts to plunder their resources. Since the onset of the pandemic, Chinese vessels have tailed Malaysian oil-exploration boats and rammed Vietnamese fishing boats. Beijing has left no doubt about its determination to repudiate accepted global norms of conduct and to control commercial activity in the region.
When this month the US deployed two of its biggest warships to the region, state media in China boasted the country “has a wide selection of anti-aircraft carrier weapons”. Pompously it claimed “any aircraft carrier movement in the region is at the pleasure” of the Chinese military. Really?
In making his announcement, Mr Pompeo put it in the context of the US “strengthening its policy on South China Sea maritime claims”. With $US5 trillion of international trade passing by ship through these waters every year, including much of the oil that fuels the global economy, the Trump administration must lose no time in showing it means what it says.
Understandably, given prevailing circumstances, Australia cautiously restated its diplomatic position that all disputes in the South China Sea must be resolved through international law. But our participation in regional naval exercises alongside the US leaves no doubt about our commitment to the defence of the right to freedom of navigation and national sovereignty. Peter Jennings of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said the US was “judging that China is potentially getting ready to push aggressively on one or other of (its) objectives in the region”, the most likely being Taiwan or the risk of China declaring an air defence identification zone in the South China Sea. However events evolve, the US declaration is timely. It should leave Xi Jinping in no doubt about the determination of the US to counter China’s unrelenting aggression and adventurism in the South China Sea and broader Indo-Pacific region. Ahead of November’s election, Mr Trump doubtless sees potential political advantage in being seen to be standing up to Mr Xi. Both he and Joe Biden must make it clear they will do whatever it takes to defend the region against Chinese aggression.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Innocent Syrians caught in Assad’s murderous assault	The Australian	Turkey, Russia and Iran deepen the humanitarian crisis
After nine years of unrelenting civil war that already has cost at least 500,000 lives and has displaced more than 16 million people, it is hard to believe Syria could be confronting even greater misery. That, however, is the grim forecast of international aid agencies as the murderous Assad regime, aided and abetted by its Russian and Iranian patrons, prosecutes a savage onslaught against northwestern Idlib province, the last rebel-held enclave in Syria. In what the UN fears could become among the worst of the atrocities during the conflict, at least 900,000 people in Idlib — overwhelmingly women and children — have fled their homes since December. They’re trying to escape an unrelenting bombardment by the Assad regime’s killer barrel bombs and heavy artillery, deadly Russian missiles and Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist ground forces.
UN official David Swanson spoke of a catastrophe as hundreds of thousands of fleeing civilians herded into a diminishing area close to Syria’s border with Turkey ahead of the brutal advance by Assad loyalists. “We’re seeing an unparalleled exodus of humanity,” he said. Earlier, UN head of humanitarian affairs Mark Lowcock warned “the biggest humanitarian horror story of the 21st century” was unfolding, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire and demanded Turkey, Russia and Iran work together to find a political solution. It will be a tragedy if their pleas are ignored. The accounts of suffering and horrifying deprivation among those fleeing, which we reported on Thursday, is set to get worse, with the Assad forces rapidly closing in on the city of Idlib. Those among its terrified population of 900,000 who have not fled are preparing to swell the exodus towards the Turkish border.
With Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rushing in troop reinforcements and armoured units to the border to create an “iron curtain” that will ensure no more Syrian refugees get across and join the 3.7 million already in Turkey, the plight of the fleeing Syrians is desperate. They are caught between what President Bashar al-Assad justifies as a drive to rid Idlib of formerly al-Qa’ida-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the only rebel group still holding out against him achieving victory, and Turkish forces determined to block them crossing the border. With so many impoverished civilians caught in the crossfire, with neither food nor medicine, it would be hard to imagine a more challenging humanitarian crisis.
Yet Mr Assad, his savage onslaught buttressed by the unflinching support of Vladimir Putin and Iran’s ayatollahs, remains unmoved. No wonder former British foreign secretary David Miliband, head of the New York-based International Rescue Committee, spoke of the catastrophe as a symptom of the utter failure of diplomacy and the global community’s abandonment of Syria’s civilians after nine years of war. Even the EU, previously so concerned about their plight, appears anxious only to ensure there is no repetition of the wave of one million Syrian refugees that flooded across the Mediterranean between 2015 and 2016.
Donald Trump’s confused decision last year to pull most US troops out of Syria has left Washington with little effective influence. US special representative James Jeffrey said Washington was “very, very worried” about the “extremely dangerous conflict” in Idlib. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for a halt to the assault, but Mr Trump’s national security adviser Robert O’Brien asked: “What are we supposed to do to stop them?” Given the staggering numbers of displaced people and the grim likelihood that it is about to get much worse, better than shoulder-shrugging leadership is needed from Washington and the international community. Western nations must unite to ensure the immediate ceasefire called for by Mr Guterres is achieved. Aid channels must be opened to alleviate the horrible plight of those fleeing the violence.It is not good enough that such a ceasefire apparently has been put in the too-hard basket because of the inevitability of a Russian veto in the Security Council. Mr Putin and Iran’s ayatollahs deserve to be sanctioned for their complicity in Mr Assad’s crimes against humanity. How the Syrian crisis plays out is vital to the Middle East. On it depends the security of Israel and prospects of an Islamic State resurgence. As the civil war approaches its grim endgame, the West will pay a high price if it allows Russia and Iran to get away with the brutal tactics they are using to keep their liegeman in power in Damascus.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Tech giants’ censorship of history must be thwarted	The Australian	Twitter, Facebook’s cancelling Donald Trump smacks of dictatorship
Incoming US president Joe Biden would show his country and the world he is a genuine libertarian and democrat if he took the lead in insisting that Twitter, Facebook, Google and other players overturn their alarming efforts to silence Donald Trump online. Regardless of his faults as a world leader, including his egregious behaviour last week, Mr Trump is an important figure at a fascinating point in history. His election in 2016, as a rank outsider, exposed the deep fissures in American society and since then he has been controversial. When professional historians come to write and analyse the current period in the context of its strategic challenges, economic struggles, culture wars, Chinese expansionism and the COVID-19 pandemic, primary sources will be central to their work. Twitter has long been Mr Trump’s preferred platform for addressing his followers, whose number had grown to 88 million — foes as well as friends — and millions more who read his tweets but were not signed up. The tweets were candid, spontaneous snapshots of his reactions and attitudes, largely undoctored by officials and spinners. In reaching for the Twitter button at all hours of the day and night, he was often his own worst enemy. But this makes it more important to preserve the record openly and transparently. As former UN ambassador Nikki Haley tweeted: “Silencing people, not to mention the President of the US, is what happens in China not our country.’’ Twitter’s attempt to justify its permanent suspension of @realDonaldTrump does not stand scrutiny. Nor is its claim that it acted “due to the risk of further incitement of violence’’ any justification for obliterating his account. The tech giants’ cancelling Mr Trump also provokes a key question. Which controversial figure will they target next? In pulling the plug on the President, they have crossed a crucial line; from being purveyors of first-hand, unedited political utterances to controllers of whose views the public will and will not be allowed to see and hear. Mr Trump has been a consequential president who, in his final days in office, as The Times writes, “may have added another notch to his complicated legacy: bringing the curtain down on the first phase of our social media age’’.
On Friday, The Australian castigated Mr Trump in relation to the violent breach of the Capitol’s security, which resulted in five deaths, including that of a police officer. The President, we said, “had been inciting the mayhem for days, tweeting exhortations to his followers to rally in Washington when both houses of congress were scheduled to go through the ceremonial process of formally certifying Mr Biden’s victory. ‘It’s going to be wild,’ he tweeted. ‘Don’t miss it’.’’ It would be hard to imagine a more incendiary act by an incumbent President, we said, than to exploit passions that were running high. The time for social media to edit or contradict those tweets was then.
In contrast, the two tweets on January 8 that finally provoked permanent suspension of his account were mild. The first said: “The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” So what? The second, while significant, was not incendiary: “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.” He will be the first president in more than 150 years not to attend his successor’s inauguration.
Christchurch gunman Brenton Tarrant demonstrated the potential of terrorists and other criminals to misuse the internet to glorify violence. All media, including social media, must guard against such abuses. Examples abound of Twitter giving voice to militant dictators, such as Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei. In Australia, it has also given jaundiced has-beens missing the limelight new leases of life as they spew their bile in limited vocabularies. Social media, in general, is more open to abuse and misuse than traditional media, which accounts for its potential to plant dangerous ideas in the minds of unstable individuals. This, regrettably, is how it has evolved; it is not a call for censorship. But cancelling Mr Trump violates the principle of free speech, a democratic cornerstone, without sufficient reason. So do the actions of Facebook and Instagram, which have blocked him indefinitely, or for “at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete”, CEO Mark Zuckerberg says. Google, Apple and Amazon are also culpable, for booting Parler, a free speech-focused social media network favoured by conservatives. Across the world, the general public and traditional media organisations should be wary of the unchecked power of a small group of unelected tech titans, including Californian billionaires Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Mr Zuckerberg, to manipulate public discourse and thinking. They must not be allowed to delete history. As Republican senator Marco Rubio has tweeted: “Even those who oppose Trump should see the danger of having a small and unelected group with the power to silence and erase anyone. And their actions will only stoke new grievances that will end up fuelling the very thing they claim to be trying to prevent.”	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
FROM THE EDITOR Te Reo a reminder of NZ’s beauty	Wanganui Chronicle	Two simple words that I love hearing spoken.
Why? Because every time I hear them, they remind me I live in a beautiful country with a rich culture and history that is unique and, most importantly, needs to be celebrated and kept alive.
As an English import to this country, I am the first to admit my Māori pronunciation is not always perfect, or in fact, anywhere near. At times, it is downright abysmal. Try as I might, my Devonshire twang and the same inability to roll my Rs that drove three consecutive French teachers to near tears as they listened to me tortuously and ineptly read aloud from Guy de Maupassant’s collected works, can leave me struggling with even the simplest of phrases or words in Māori.
And that’s a shame, because while those French teachers argued French was the most beautiful of languages, after nearly 20 years in New Zealand, I disagree. The most beautiful language is Māori. Don’t believe me? Try saying mōrena out loud without smiling. It’s impossible isn’t it? Even with my lack of perfect pronunciation.
Thankfully my children (half-English, half-German, 100 per cent Kiwi) have not inherited my lack of skill in this area. Growing up in New Zealand, they, like their friends, all embrace and use Māori words in their daily life. From their toddler years, they have been encouraged to kanikani (dance) or pakipaki (clap), to eat their kai, and to soak in the Māori language and culture around them.
While this is great, and I freely admit to being incredibly jealous of my 12-year-old daughter’s ability to roll her Rs so beautifully, I wish my children were learning more than they are.
Their primary school, like many others around the country, does not include te reo Māori as a set subject in the curriculum. At high school, my son has just had to make choices on his subjects for next year, and while subjects such as science, math and English are compulsory, learning te reo Māori is only an option alongside Spanish and Japanese. This is not a criticism of the specific schools, but rather the state of a national curriculum that treats the indigenous language of our nation as an optional extra.
That attitude leads to adults who mumble rather than sing the words of the Māori version of God Defend New Zealand, who mispronounce place names such as Taupō or Tauranga, and call our beautiful maunga Egmont instead of Taranaki.
Read MoreCommunity brushes up on Te Reo during Māori Language Week - NZ HeraldCheering for our language - NZ HeraldWork needed to keep te reo strong - NZ HeraldStratford Primary School pupils visit rest homes to perform kapa haka - NZ Herald
That attitude, in part, is why te reo Māori is listed as one of the “vulnerable” languages on Unesco’s endangered languages list. This is something we need to change.
Te reo Māori should not be an add-on, an option or a choice. It should be something we all use in our daily speech as naturally and confidently as we use English words.
While it might not yet be on the curriculum in every school, we can put it into action in our daily life right now.
By using words such as whānau, kai, hīkoi, aroha or wai as naturally as we say family, food, walk, love or water, and making every effort to pronounce them correctly, we can all do our part to uphold the mana of the language.
the theme for Māori Language Week this year is Kia Kaha te Reo Māori - Let’s make the Māori language strong, and that is something we can all do, by giving the language the mana it deserves.
As I have said, my pronunciation is nowhere near perfect, but that doesn’t stop me trying, and it shouldn’t stop others either.
Please, give it a go, don’t be too whakamā (embarrassed), but instead korerotia te reo (keep speaking the language), and together lets celebrate the beauty of New Zealand’s indigenous language and help preserve it for generations to come.
Heoi anō tāku mō nāianei (that’s all for now).

A brazen anti-Semitic ‘blacklist’	The Australian	UN targets companies employing hundreds of Palestinians
In 2018 Nikki Haley, Donald Trump’s UN ambassador at the time, was right on the money when she described the UN Human Rights Council as a “cesspool of political bias” against Israel. Her exasperated assessment then is even more relevant now following the publication of the council’s “blacklist” of 112 international and local companies operating in the Israeli-occupied territories. It’s a shameful attempt to strike a blow against the Middle East’s only functioning democracy and upholder of the rule of law and religious freedom. The aim is clearly to mobilise the 47-member UN body, of which Australia is a member, to help the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement campaign seeking to isolate Israel. UN deputy executive director for advocacy Bruno Stagno Ugarte says it puts all the companies “on notice (that) to do business with illegal settlements is to aid in the commission of war crimes”.
Given the companies — from Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia to Motorola — employ hundreds of Palestinian workers, allowing them opportunities they otherwise would not have, it beggars credulity and common sense that the UN should see them as “aiding the commission of war crimes”. No wonder Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council executive director Colin Rubenstein described publication of the blacklist as “the ultimate sign of hypocrisy and bias by the UNHRC” and “a witch-hunt that reminds us of Nazi-era boycotts of the Jewish people”. There is no precedent for any UN body taking similar action over a disputed territory, and no basis in international law for it to do so.
According to the UN Watch monitoring agency, there are more than 100 territorial disputes across the world, including Crimea, Western Sahara, Northern Cyprus, Kashmir and Tibet. None has been targeted for similar action by any UN body — only Israel. Yet, as Dr Rubenstein pointed out, it is not in breach of international law for the 112 companies to operate in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. “They are legitimate businesses providing goods and services … they are not breaking any international laws.” Given the make-up of an organisation that claims to be the world’s “premier human rights body”, there can be little surprise about its obsessive targeting of Israel with the blacklist. Its publication has been in the works since 2016, when countries with some of the worst human rights records, including Cuba and Venezuela, made the running at the UNHRC. Nicolas Maduro’s jackbooted Venezuelan dictatorship remains a leading light, alongside other great exponents of human rights such as Angola, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, Somalia and Libya.In 2018, Scott Morrison, in pledging Australia would not abstain from voting against anti-Israel resolutions at the UN, said: “We won’t turn a blind eye to an anti-Semitic agenda masquerading as defence of human rights.” It is hard to see the UNHRC blacklist as anything but part of a blatantly “anti-Semitic agenda” aimed at crippling companies legitimately bringing goods, services and much-needed employment to the occupied territories. Australia must waste no opportunity to condemn and counter the council’s brazen hypocrisy and the sinister witch-hunt it has embarked on.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Trump’s legacy forever tarnished	The Australian	US Capitol footage broadcast during the trial was unforgettable
Because of party-political imperatives, it was always improbable that enough Republicans would break ranks to give the Democrats the two-thirds majority of 67 they needed to convict Donald Trump in his second US Senate impeachment trial. The 57-43 vote for conviction on an “incitement of insurrection” charge, while it fell short, however, is unlikely to change the reality that his White House legacy will be forever tarnished by the violence during the January 6 mob attack by his enraged supporters on the US Capitol, the heart of US democracy.
The verdict may keep his hopes alive of remaining in public life and running for the presidency in 2024. But with influential Republican leaders, notably the widely admired former UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, previously one of his most enthusiastic supporters, turning against him, the impact of the damaging accounts of his alleged role in the attack are clear. “He let us down … we shouldn’t have followed him,” Ms Haley said. Welcoming his acquittal, Mr Trump launched his usual defence about “another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country”. During the trial, his lawyers made much of his injunction to his supporters to make their voices heard “peacefully”.
But after days of evidence about the shameful events following the then president’s address to the mob, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, formerly one of his main collaborators, made his views clear: “There’s no question – none – that president Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.’’ Had Mr Trump still been in office Senator McConnell might have voted for his conviction, he said. The decision to acquit, he emphasised, did not mean the Senate condoned violence. “It is simply that senators did what the former president failed to do. We put our constitutional duty first.” Senator McConnell did not discount the possibility of Mr Trump being tried in civil or criminal courts: “We have a criminal justice system. We have civil litigation. Former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one.” Mr Trump may not have thought the protesters had any chance of breaching what turned out to be the Capitol’s paltry security. But provoking the mob was unconscionable.
Mr Trump’s legal battles appear far from over. In Georgia, prosecutors are investigating his attempt to illegally overturn the state’s election result. Several other lawsuits are also heading his way, some linked to his business dealings.
Joe Biden was right to intervene on Friday to persuade Democrat legislative managers to call time on the Senate impeachment proceedings despite new evidence of a blistering, expletive-laden row between Mr Trump and House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy at the height of the riot. Mr McCarthy begged Mr Trump to intervene to call off the insurrectionists rampaging through the halls of congress. Mr Trump responded by accusing him of not being supportive of his attempts to overturn the election “fraud”. Enraged, Mr McCarthy reportedly responded: “Who the f … do you think you are talking to?” Disclosure of the incendiary conversation threatened to further prolong the impeachment process and delay the passage through congress of President Biden’s vital $US19 trillion COVID rescue passage. Despite the controversy they stirred, the hearings were the right thing in an open, democratic society. It brought the issue into the open and crystallised events that shocked Americans and much of the world. Many will understandably remain puzzled about the outcome, when a president cannot be found guilty for his involvement in triggering a riotous onslaught on the US Capitol. But for Democrats and Republicans it is time to move on. Mr Biden deserves clear air to bed down his administration’s legislative program, fulfil his promises to voters to heal the deep divisions afflicting US society, and deal with the human and economic toll inflicted by the pandemic.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Biden voters in hunt for Trump	The Australian	US Democrats have ditched the extremism of Bernie Sanders
Joe Biden’s victories in the latest US primaries should leave President Donald Trump in no doubt about the head of steam Democrats are building up in their bid to retake the White House. The former vice-president’s double-digit win over Bernie Sanders in Michigan, which the democratic socialist won against Hillary Clinton four years ago, showed the party’s determination to ensure it ends up with a moderate. Above all, it needs an electable candidate to run against what it sees as a vulnerable president. Senator Sanders’s prospects of overcoming the Biden surge and winning the nomination appear unlikely. In Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Idaho and Washington state, Senator Sanders was doing worse than in his race against Mrs Clinton.
In Missouri, Mr Biden easily defeated Senator Sanders, yet in 2016 the senator came within a whisker of beating Mrs Clinton. For Mr Biden, his Michigan win could hardly be more significant given that in the 2016 general election, the state was won by Mr Trump by a mere 0.23 per cent against Mrs Clinton. Whether Senator Sanders stays in the race remains to be seen. It is significant that in the aftermath of his latest victories, Mr Biden went out of his way to assure Sanders supporters “there is a place for every one of you in our campaign”.After the nominating chaos of the past months, the moderate centre of the Democratic Party seems to have come together to block Senator Sanders and his left-wing extremism and unite behind Mr Biden. That appeared inconceivable until the former vice-president’s Super Tuesday triumph. Though he is himself no spring chicken, Mr Trump derides Mr Biden as “Sleepy Joe” and casts him as an incoherent geriatric has-been from Barack Obama’s administration, but the coalition of white working-class voters and African-Americans that swept Mr Biden to victory should not be underestimated. While there is a long way to go in the race for the White House and Mr Trump is a formidable campaigner, the Democrats’ optimism may not be misplaced: every major current opinion poll gives Mr Biden a general election lead over the President ranging from seven to 11 points.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Dangerous message on Korea	The Australian	US allies should contribute a fair amount to their defences
Reports Donald Trump is considering options to reduce the 28,500-strong US military deployment in South Korea may be “negotiating bluster” aimed at persuading Seoul to stump up more cash for its own defence. Even if that is the case, it would be hard to imagine anything more likely to echo around the world as a sign of US weakness at a dangerous time of rising tensions over Chinese aggression in our region. As The Wall Street Journal commented, the notion of even a partial US withdrawal from South Korea is “the President’s worst national security idea since he floated a Taliban visit to (the presidential retreat of) Camp David last year”. Republican senator Ben Sasse, from Nebraska, described it accurately as the “kind of strategic incompetence” that is “Jimmy Carter weak”.
Mr Trump has never hidden his determination that US allies should pay more for their own defence. Nor has he ever retreated from his declared intention to bring US forces home. Last month, one of his closest advisers, Richard Grenfell, reiterated the administration’s determination to return troops “from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South Korea, Japan and Germany”. With the presidential election little more than 100 days away, Mr Trump has ordered home thousands of troops from Afghanistan. He has also unnerved Western allies by ordering home 9500 of the 34,500 US troops stationed in Germany. Talks with South Korea over the $US1.3bn ($1.8bn) a year Mr Trump is demanding for troops stationed there are deadlocked. The Pentagon has reportedly presented him with tactical options on reducing the US presence of 28,500 troops, although administration officials say no decision has been made. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent a powerful message last week about the “completely unlawful” behaviour of Beijing in the South China Sea. But a US retreat from South Korea, or even the suggestion of one, would be a gift to Chinese President Xi Jinping and unsettle other US allies, especially Japan and Taiwan. It would also undermine Mr Trump’s claim to be the leader the US needs to deal with China, as opposed to Joe Biden’s “weakness”.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
RBA’s historic package to build a ‘bridge’ to recovery	The Australian	Ultra-low interest rates are here for years, but not forever
The Reserve Bank of Australia is pulling out all stops to reduce the economic and financial carnage from the coronavirus pandemic. Running low on traditional monetary firepower, on Thursday the central bank pulled out its emergency “Big Bertha” howitzer. RBA governor Philip Lowe announced a rescue effort, including an all-time low cash rate of 0.25 per cent (down from 0.5 per cent); the start of quantitative easing via secondhand Treasury bond purchases (targeting an ultra-low 0.25 per cent yield for the key three-year bond); and a three-year funding facility worth at least $90bn (at a fixed rate of 0.25 per cent) for banks to lend to small and medium-sized businesses with cashflow problems. This is a massive package, a historic moment for the RBA, yet one it is well-placed to deliver. Dr Lowe said cheap money was here for “some years”, but not forever, as the misery of job losses and drop in output would be temporary.
Ever the optimist, Dr Lowe declared the virus would be contained and the Australian economy would recover. Of course, he’s right. But the days are long, turbulent, worrisome and loaded with new pronouncements. Dr Lowe declared the bank’s priority, echoing the entire official family of economic brains, “is to support jobs, incomes and businesses”, so that when the health crisis recedes, the country is well-placed to recover strongly. The metaphor used by the economic committee to save Australia, Canberra and Martin Place now in lockstep, is “building a bridge”, getting as many workers, families and businesses as possible to the safety of normalcy. This is new monetary territory for Australia, although there are parallels with the global financial crisis, when credit markets dried up, trading liquidity deteriorated and market volatility made it difficult for financial institutions.
Yet some players appear impervious to new policy. The huge swings on the sharemarket and the slump in prices are a reflection of many factors: repricing of risk, unwinding of exuberance, defensiveness, reduced profit expectations and a herd mentality. Some of this is linked to the real economy of goods, services, jobs and capital spending. Some of it is not. This is what markets do: watching them can be dull, thrilling, despairing, all in the same day. Over the long haul, dividends and prices are linked to fundamentals. Still, it’s cold comfort for investors of limited means, especially those who have saved for retirement. Low interest rates will nudge them to take on more risk, a fact weighing heavily on our monetary mandarins.
But, as Dr Lowe said many times before COVID-19 appeared, the nation’s economic fundamentals are sound. We are a rich country, with solid institutions, blessed with resources, land and people. The RBA chief urged us to remember that these endowments and structures will be there when the crisis passes. Another factor to grasp in the storm is that our financial system is strong, resilient and well-capitalised. Banks enjoy a privileged position, through guarantees and the like; so far, they appear to be stepping up to the task, with borrowing-rate reductions and repayment adjustments. The RBA funding facility measures are weighted to help small borrowers, the most vulnerable to a plummet in spending. Josh Frydenberg also announced a $15bn measure to support second-tier lenders and their customers.A bigger, broader fiscal package is also imminent, with an expansion of income support to displaced workers. Some will argue the government’s first stimulus was inadequate. But Scott Morrison’s request to officials was to make the response temporary, targeted, proportionate and scalable. It’s clear now that the social displacement, economic disruption and medical crisis will last for at least six months. Rather than fiscal stimulus per se, the coming rollout of emergency economic measures is now presented by the Treasurer as “cushioning the blow”. As Australia closes borders to foreigners, increasingly restricts movement and gatherings, shutters its workplaces and puts even more pressure on its medical personnel and systems to flatten the curve of infections, the economy risks being suffocated. We are resilient, to a degree. With the RBA ventilating the banks, the Morrison government’s fiscal doctors are switching to survival mode, keeping the oxygen flowing to as many failing body parts as possible.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
EDITORIAL Rhetoric must be reinforced now with substance	Wanganui Chronicle	Under Jacinda Ardern’s stewardship, Labour is pushing into the unknown with a historic milestone.
After winning a second term with a massive 49per cent of the vote and a 64-seat mandate, the Government now faces the challenge of living up to it.
Labour has never won more than 60 seats and occupied the centre of New Zealand politics as emphatically as it does now.
In the MMP era, Helen Clark took the party to a 52-seat victory in 2002. National’s John Key had 60 in 2014.
Ardern is only 40 and already has an international profile beyond what most New Zealand prime ministers have ever had.
Partly it is due to circumstance, with the pandemic, Christchurch shooting and White Island eruption occurring in her first term. When handled well, adversity can forge a bond between a leader and community like nothing else.
Ardern is also a top communicator at ease with people and social media; popular at home; aware of talking to an audience beyond the country, and a female leader in global politics.
Ardern could potentially achieve a lot more with her x-factor and influence. But she could also run the risk of it all eventually seeming hollow if the rhetoric and personal appeal is not regularly backed up with substance and achievements.
As a government Labour has the chance to build a distinctive legacy and improve voters’ lives while bringing the country out of recession.
Or it could concentrate on managing in a less ambitious way, to keep middle New Zealand onside.
The first way risks controversy and hard choices, as it is impossible to reconcile all competing interests. The second way could result in policy inertia and disappointment.
There were hints of both strands in Ardern’s election night speech. She referred to party policy goals and accelerating the Government’s approach to the economic recovery, which implied some urgency to get under way again.
However, her main message was to promise that Labour would govern for all New Zealanders and she talked up the need to see others’ views in an “increasingly polarised world”.
The rise in the third-party vote for Act (8per cent) and the Greens (7.6per cent) is probably a message that a section of voters would like to see new policy ideas and plans in the mix.
National, with 27per cent of the vote and 35 seats, appears set on the cycle of introspection and regeneration Labour went through during the Key years. And NZ First came face to face with a no-entry sign. —NZ Herald	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

Trump presidency dying in futile assault on democracy	The Australian	Under attack from mob violence, the US institutions stood resilient
Wednesday, January 6, was a day of dark infamy, not epiphany, in the US when a mob of violent Donald Trump supporters, their rage fuelled by the defeated President’s lies about a stolen election, stormed the US Capitol. The assault on one of the world’s great citadels of liberty was inexcusable, as was Mr Trump’s failure to call off the mob as the assault unfolded. In a pointed, poignant speech broadcast from Delaware during the attack, incoming president Joe Biden noted that at their best the words of a president can inspire; at their worst they can incite: “Therefore, I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfil his oath and defend the constitution and demand an end to this siege.” The storming of the Capitol, as Mr Biden said, was “not dissent. It’s disorder, it’s chaos, it borders on sedition”. When Mr Trump finally responded after watching the violence on television in the White House for several hours, there was no demand to end the insurrection. He lauded as “special” the mob responsible for one of gravest assaults on the Capitol since George Washington laid its cornerstone in 1793. He reiterated his falsehood about a “stolen” election and simply told the rioters it was time to go home. “We love you,” he added.
The US has seen worse violence and riots, including from some of the left. But this was the Capitol. Mr Trump had been inciting the mayhem for days, tweeting exhortations to his followers to rally in Washington when both houses of congress were scheduled to go through the ceremonial process of formally certifying Mr Biden’s victory. “It’s going to be wild,” he tweeted. “Don’t miss it.” As the certification proceedings got under way, Mr Trump told the rally: “You’ll never take back our country with weakness … you have to show strength and you have to be strong” before enjoining the mob to march on the Capitol, telling them to “make their voices heard … let the weak ones get out; this is a time for strength”. If “you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country any more”, he told them. “We will never give up and never concede, we will stop the steal.” It would be hard to imagine a more incendiary act by an incumbent US President than to exploit passions that were running so high.
Serious questions need to be asked and answered about what is puzzling many members of congress — why was the building’s normally tight security so underdone, especially on such an important day? With little resistance, seemingly, the attackers were able to crash through barriers, scale walls, break windows, gain entry, occupy offices, including that of house Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate chamber. One frightened policeman was captured on film backing away up a staircase, understandably, as a mob closed in. The death of a young woman, air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, who reportedly had travelled from California to join Trump supporters and was shot in the neck at close range, also must be investigated.
Vice-President Mike Pence, presiding over the certification ceremony, had to be protected from the marauders and evacuated from the building. Unlike his boss, Mr Pence made it clear on Twitter that those responsible would face the full force of the law. One of the lowest acts of Mr Trump’s day of shame was the President coaxing his loyal and widely respected Vice-President to do what he was constitutionally barred from doing — to abuse his role as the presiding officer over the formal certification session by rejecting Mr Biden’s victory and keeping Mr Trump in the White House. “Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us,” Mr Trump cajoled. But Mr Pence made his unwillingness to be part of such an unconstitutional scheme clear. “My oath to support and defend the constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” he announced. Mr Trump, enraged, rounded on the man who had served him and the nation well for four years, often putting the Trump administration in a better light. Mr Trump accused Mr Pence of “not having the courage” to act, even though doing so would have been unlawful. Other key Trump backers, such as Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, also found Mr Trump’s conduct beyond the pale. As former president George W Bush said as he followed the mayhem on television: “This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic — not our democratic republic.” The passions of those who attacked the Capitol, Mr Bush said, had been “inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes”.
Unlike lesser nations, however, US democracy will prevail, as it did after the 9/11 terror attack, after ignominious defeat in Vietnam and after the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln, John F Kennedy and others. Mr Biden struck the right note when he reminded Americans, and the world, of Lincoln’s advice: “We shall nobly save or merely lose the last, best hope on Earth … The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just — a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless.” After “this godawful display today”, Mr Biden said, “let’s bring it home to every Republican and Democrat and independent in the nation, that we must step up. This is the United States of America”. Around the world, regimes hostile to the US and its allies — China, Russia, Iran, North Korea — will be watching the transition to the Biden presidency closely. After a day on which US democracy was put under “unprecedented assault, unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times”, as Mr Biden said, it engendered confidence to see the certification of the electoral college, a sacred ritual of the US democratic process, proceeding in an orderly way, just a few hours after the storming of the Capitol. It was finally completed at 3.44am Thursday, US time. At the 11th hour Mr Trump promised an orderly transition.
On paper, Mr Biden’s task for the next four years has been made easier by the Democrats winning the two Georgia Senate runoffs, giving the party control of the Senate as well as the House of Representatives and the White House. Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, and Raphael Warnock, a pastor at the church where Martin Luther King Jr preached, will be Georgia’s first Democrat senators for more than 20 years. Mr Warnock will be the state’s first black senator. Judging by the outcome, Mr Trump’s ego-driven push to make the contest a referendum about himself cost the Republican Party dearly. The races should have been a referendum on blocking the Democrats from controlling all of congress and the executive branch. But that message was lost by Mr Trump’s insistence on telling voters, day after day, that he was cheated in November, regardless of the lack of credible evidence any court — including those presided over by sound judges appointed by him — would accept.
As a result of the Democrats’ unfettered power, Mr Biden will be less able to resist the demands of his party’s progressive wing to lurch to the left. He should not forget that four years ago the Republicans, too, enjoyed a clean sweep. The party gaining the unexpected trifecta will embolden the likes of senator Bernie Sanders and other socialists. As The Wall Street Journal noted: “We hope Republicans keep Mr Trump’s contribution to these defeats in mind over the next two years as their taxes and energy costs rise, as woke cultural mandates rain down from Washington, and as more of the economy comes under political control. By his destructive behaviour, especially since his defeat, Mr Trump has erased much of his own legacy.” That is unfortunate, especially for the “quiet Americans”, law-abiding Republican supporters, which is most of the 74 million Americans who voted for Mr Trump. Many appreciated his pre-COVID economic reforms and tax cuts, his foreign policy work in Israel and the Middle East, his firmness with China, his sensible judicial appointments and his willingness to give the pro-life lobby a hearing.
But most Republican voters know that his most sacred duty as President is to defend the constitution, not sabotage it, and to “accept his defeat with honour, not attempt a dishonourable revolt”, as Paul Kelly writes on Friday. It is a measure of the contempt Mr Trump has drawn on himself that politicians on both sides and business and civic leaders have urged Mr Pence and members of the Trump cabinet to move to remove Mr Trump as President when less than a fortnight of his term remains. He leaves the White House with a deeply divided nation and Republican Party. Mr Trump’s shameful departure, however, and the willingness of party leaders such as Mr Pence and Senator McConnell to take a stand may ease the way for the GOP to start a new chapter in the post-Trump era. It will have to do so, however, without the ultra-right rump, whose refusal to accept the democratic process has been laid bare. On the ground in Washington, Cameron Stewart snapped a protester in bullhorns as he waved a flag proclaiming “this is our 1776”, a reference to US independence. The protest, Washington police chief Charles Ramsey said, came “as close to a coup attempt as this country has ever seen”. But now the Biden-Harris team is certified, and US democracy faces another four likely tumultuous years. Even under assault, its institutions will continue to stand firm.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Students lack civics knowledge	The Australian	Understanding how democracy and the political system work is basic The past 12 months have underlined the fragility but also the resilience of democracy. The raid on the Capitol in Washington DC, claims of vote rigging in the US and elsewhere, evidence of foreign interference in Australia and other nations, and some Australian premiers going too far in usurping the rights of citizens with extreme restrictions on freedom of movement during the COVID-19 pandemic are important matters for public debate. A basic knowledge, at least, of how our system of government works is necessary to follow and participate in the national conversation about these and other political issues.
For that reason, it is concerning that among numerous shortcomings, the nation’s education system is failing to equip most secondary students with the knowledge and skills to become active and informed citizens. Nationwide testing shows young people are also losing interest in political news and world affairs, as Rebecca Urban reports on Thursday. Results from the latest national civics and citizenship assessment show that just 38 per cent of Year 10 students have a proficient knowledge of democracy, Australia’s system of government, citizens’ rights and legal obligations, and national values. The achievement level of Year 6 students was better, at 53 per cent. The gap suggests more needs to be done to improve students’ knowledge in the early years of secondary school in order to meet the expectations of the national curriculum. More than 10,000 students from 627 primary and secondary schools were tested under the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority’s national assessment program. As ACARA chief executive David de Carvalho told Urban, a “crowded curriculum” particularly in the secondary years, could help to explain students’ lack of proficiency in civics and citizenship.
Decluttering the school curriculum is a priority. And the NSW government is on the right track working towards that objective, with more than 80 courses offered in Years 9, 10, 11 and 12 to be phased out by next year, The Australian reported last week. Courses in critical thinking, bushcraft, volunteering, law and order and leadership studies will be scrapped to allow schools to focus on “core learning areas’’, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. It makes sense that the current review of the national curriculum, agreed by education ministers in June last year, will aim to ensure students are taught “important content” that they “need to know”, as Mr de Carvalho says. Schools and school authorities need to be wary about allowing classroom time to be taken up with lessons in climate change, the environment and how to protest under plans being led by green activists to be discussed at the UN climate summit in Glasgow. The ACARA testing showed students were already deeply aware of and concerned about environmental issues. The testing also revealed young people have increasingly positive attitudes towards Australia’s Indigenous people. And two-thirds of Year 10 students reported they had collected money for a charity or social cause. Those trends are positive. But Education Minister Alan Tudge is right when he says the system needs to do better: “We all have an interest in our kids learning about our democracy before they hit voting age.”	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Safeguarding jobs must be Fair Work’s main priority	The Australian	Union claim for a minimum wage rise is strikingly excessive
The employment statistics for April were sobering enough, with almost 600,000 jobs lost and 490,000 workers exiting the labour market. But the survey was taken a month ago, so the headline unemployment rate of 6.2 per cent doesn’t yet convey the carnage in the real economy from the policy-induced shutdowns to slow the rate of new coronavirus cases. More telling were figures for total hours worked last month, which slumped by 9.2 per cent from March. The under-utilisation rate — taking in the unemployed and those who’d like to work more hours — is at a record high of 19.9 per cent or around 2.7 million Australians. Scott Morrison called it a “tough day” for the nation, while Josh Frydenberg warned that over winter “the economic numbers will get worse before they get better”.
The human toll would be higher without the Morrison government’s emergency doubling of the JobSeeker payment and the new JobKeeper wage-subsidy scheme, at a mammoth cost of $130bn, with 860,000 businesses enrolled. So far six million employees are covered. But Labor claims there are hundreds of thousands of people in dole queues because of a “deliberate act” of the Coalition and its “bungling” of JobKeeper. The program is a new political fault line in Canberra, as well as an arena for a fight between capital and labour. Employers have accused trade unions of telling members not to nominate for the $1500 a fortnight scheme so they can circumvent temporary changes to the Fair Work Act, such as issuing stand-downs with less notice and working fewer hours or at a different location. That flexibility is keeping employees tied to employers, accelerating the recovery. Gaming the rules is counter-productive.
As well, lifting social distancing restrictions in line with the three-stage process designed by the national cabinet will progressively boost activity. Treasury estimates that by July, all things going plan, the reopening of the economy will be worth $9bn a month and will see 850,000 people back at work. Endangering that uplift, however, is the outrageous claim by the ACTU to lift the minimum wage by $30 a week or 4 per cent. Unions argue it would drag the economy out of recession and boost consumer confidence. But doing so in the middle of the deepest commercial malaise since the Depression would be a job killer and push distressed small businesses to the wall. We already have the highest minimum wage in the world. Every student of the dismal science knows that pushing up the cost of something isn’t going to stimulate demand for it but will sedate it.
As workplace editor Ewin Hannan reports, pay rises for two million low-paid workers could now be delayed as Fair Work Commission President Iain Ross considers deferring or staggering minimum wage rises because of the economic shock from COVID-19. The law requires a decision by the industrial umpire to make an annual national minimum wage order that comes into effect from July 1. But in exceptional circumstances or in cases of economic incapacity the commission can make multiple determinations for some or all employees from a later date or dates. As the commission’s staff wrote in a new discussion paper, the industrial umpire has discretion to exempt some employers and employees from modern award minimum wage increases or to reduce the amount of the increase for some employers and employees. Let’s see some pragmatism.In our present miasma and misery, that approach is prudent and necessary. Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter argues the absolute priority for the commission should be preserving jobs. “So that when we come out of the health response we’ve got as much of the architecture of the Australian economy left as we can preserve, to regrow, rebuild and get government out of the economy,” he said. We think the ACTU’s claim is manifestly excessive and would jeopardise the viability of businesses, especially in retail and hospitality. Unions should trade off wage rises for jobs. Official forecasts show gross domestic product is likely to shrink by 10 per cent this quarter, with the number of hours worked dropping by 20 per cent. An 80 per cent economy won’t generate the profits or dynamism we need to restore living standards and productivity growth, nor will it entice companies to expand, invest, innovate or hire workers. To get people back in jobs, we must ease restrictions, enhance workplace flexibility and lower cost overheads for a competitive baseline.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
EDITORIAL Trump is facing tough election	Wanganui Chronicle	United States President Donald Trump is famously not shy about self-promotion and praise.
But should he win re-election in seven months, even after the country has staggered through an economy-busting health emergency, it would truly be a historic achievement.
The US only had 332 cases and 17 Covid-19 deaths just over a month ago. But it now tops worldwide case numbers with more than 312,100 cases and 8500 deaths. It took 66 days for the country to get to 100,000 cases but only five days to then reach 200,000 and a further three days to get to 300,000.
Critics of Trump’s handling of the pandemic argue he hobbled preparedness, ignored warnings, downplayed the threat, was slow to take action and is still fumbling.
Trump has shifted blame on to state governors saying “frankly, many of the states were unprepared for this” and veered between sombre warnings and risky impatience to “reopen” America.
The virus is immune to tactics that have served Trump in the past. It has its own timeline, it dominates the news, it can’t be distracted.
Probably neither the virus nor the economic fallout will clear by November. Senior US medical official Dr Anthony Fauci says a second wave of the virus is likely in the northern autumn. And any vaccine is estimated to be a year away.

EDITORIAL Trump now faces tough election	The Northern Advocate	United States President Donald Trump is famously not shy about self-promotion and praise.
But should he win re-election in seven months, even after the country has staggered through an economy-busting health emergency, it would truly be a historic achievement.
The US only had 332 cases and 17 Covid-19 deaths just over a month ago. But it now tops worldwide case numbers with more than 312,100 cases and 8500 deaths. It took 66 days for the country to get to 100,000 cases but only five days to then reach 200,000 and a further three days to get to 300,000.
Critics of Trump’s handling of the pandemic argue he hobbled preparedness, ignored warnings, downplayed the threat, was slow to take action and is still fumbling.
Trump has shifted blame on to state governors saying “frankly, many of the states were unprepared for this” and veered between sombre warnings and risky impatience to “reopen” America.
The virus is immune to tactics that have served Trump in the past. It has its own timeline, it dominates the news, it can’t be distracted.
Probably neither the virus nor the economic fallout will clear by November. Senior US medical official Dr Anthony Fauci says a second wave of the virus is likely in the northern autumn. And any vaccine is estimated to be a year away.

Queensland would stage a brilliant Olympic Games	The Australian	Unity between political and sports leaders should clear the last fence Cycling on a sunny winter’s day beside the ocean at Alexandra Headland on the Sunshine Coast. Equestrian eventers charging across the rolling terrain of a leafy golf course near the heart of Brisbane. Beach volleyball at the Gold Coast. Hockey on synthetic turf at Ballymore. A bounty of gold in the pool. Southeast Queensland’s bid to host the 2032 Olympics and Paralympic Games, endorsed unanimously as the preferred candidate of the International Olympic Committee, is stirring the imaginations of sports lovers around the nation and overseas. The Morrison and Palaszczuk governments have united to embrace it, along with the Brisbane City Council and regional mayors. Queensland estimates that hosting the Games, which would be geared to breaking even, would bring $7.4bn in economic benefits, 130,000 direct jobs, tens of thousands of indirect jobs, tourism growth of about $20bn between 2020 and 2036, and boost trade exports.
It is “not a done deal”, as the IOC’s Future Host Commission chairwoman, Kristin Kloster Aasen, made clear. But it is “very advanced”, with “a number of proposals that work well for us”. In the post-COVID Olympic “new norm”, the lavish bidding processes of the past have gone. So have expectations of extravagant new venues. If Brisbane triumphs, the campaign will have cost less than the $10m Scott Morrison pledged to fund it. Bigger, more spectacular proposals are no longer better. And that suits southeast Queensland, where 85 per cent of the required venues are already in place. What no rival contender — Doha, Budapest, a Rhine-Ruhr German bid and the Chinese cities of Chengdu and Chongqing — can match are Queensland’s natural backdrops, especially at their best in July and August. Australia’s stability, cleanliness and successful management of the pandemic should stand us in good stead.
As the Prime Minister told question time on Thursday, Australian Olympic Committee chief executive Matt Carroll summed up one of the bid’s advantages when he said: “Australia brings certainty in uncertain times.” Our track record in staging big events — Expo 88, several Commonwealth Games, the Melbourne Olympics in 1956 and most of all the Sydney Games in 2000 — counts for a lot. Footage of favourite events in Sydney still tugs Australians’ heartstrings. Rival contenders will gain a look-in only if Brisbane inexplicably tumbles at the final hurdle. It is up to governments and our Olympic leaders, working in unison, to ensure the bid does not falter. The guiding hand of Australian Olympic Committee president and IOC vice-president John Coates will be invaluable. He deserves much of the credit for bringing us to this point. The role of gold medal winner Cathy Freeman also was invaluable. As Wayne Smith and Jacquelin Magnay wrote on Thursday, the woman who lit the flame at the Sydney Games “did the same thing, metaphorically speaking, for Brisbane as she outlined her story to the Future Host commissioners headed by Aasen. She traced her life, from being born in Mackay into the Kuku Yalanji people of her mother and grandmother, with her dad a Burri Gubba man … But it was when Freeman explained that when she moved to Hughenden as a 10-year-old child and she was forced to do all her running in the desert that she truly captured the spirit of the bid”.
The bid began with an idea proposed by Smith in an article in The Australian in February 2015. Smith, who has covered eight Olympic Games, put the idea to Brisbane’s lord mayor at the time, Graham Quirk, who took it to a meeting of southeast Queensland mayors. Following Brisbane’s successful staging of the G20 summit in November 2014, the city was the obvious choice to be Australia’s next candidate to host the Olympics, Smith wrote. Mr Quirk agreed: “It’s Australia’s new ‘world city’. We have demonstrated we are capable of staging world events, staging them safely and staging them successfully with ­attention to detail.” A final decision could be made as early as the Tokyo Games in July. If successful, the Games will belong to Queensland as much as Brisbane, with the state proposing 21 games venues in Brisbane, six on the Gold Coast and three on the Sunshine Coast. The Whitsundays would be a spectacular backdrop for sailing; football heats could be staged in Townsville. Much remains to be decided, including major upgrades of transport infrastructure such as the often congested Brisbane-to-Sunshine Coast highway, a corridor that needs a rail link as soon as possible. The chance to host the Olympics in 11 years, after weathering COVID-19, should set our national spirit soaring.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Lessons from the coronavirus	The Australian	Universities need strategies to avoid over-reliance on China
University campuses will feel like different places this semester with as many as one in 10 students absent, at home in China because of the coronavirus. In an over-reaction, Chinese authorities have accused the Morrison government of succumbing to “panic and over-action” in stopping flights between the two countries. But most students and their families are unlikely to blame Australia for the situation. They are familiar with the extreme quarantine measures in China and are likely to regard Australia’s travel ban as reasonable. That said, it is vital that Australian universities be proactive in putting the students’ interests first. In addition to fulfilling their duty of care, universities are well aware that rival education exporters such as Britain and Canada have not imposed travel bans.
The university that has provided the most extensive response so far, higher education editor Tim Dodd wrote on Wednesday, is the Australian National University. ANU is offering free online courses to commencing students affected by the travel ban if they cannot make it to campus in time for first semester, which starts next week; they can study on campus if they arrive before March 31. ANU also is offering students late withdrawal without penalty (financial or academic) from first semester courses. And if those who make a late start to the semester because of the travel bans fail a subject, they will be allowed to repeat courses without paying fees again. Other institutions are offering later start dates for first semester. Such measures will be helpful for Chinese students travelling to Australia after a 14-day break en route in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Cambodia. That approach to getting around the direct travel ban — calculated from individuals’ departure from China until their arrival in Australia — was “perfectly within the guidelines”, Education Minister Dan Tehan confirmed on Thursday’s front page.
Nearly 100,000 Chinese students have been affected by the travel ban, which has been extended another week until February 29. If they all miss first semester the cost to the universities will be about $2bn. Provided the students return for semester two and go on to complete their degrees, the revenue will be postponed rather than lost, eventually costing universities about $40m — chickenfeed for the sector, as Dodd wrote on Wednesday.
But should the crisis continue into next semester, Centre for Independent Studies adjunct scholar Salvatore Babones calculates the education export sector stands to lose $2.8bn to $3.8bn. The Group of Eight elite universities would be hardest hit. Regardless of cost, the looming crunch underlines the heavy dependence of Australian universities on China. In November last year, Chinese enrolments at Australian universities totalled almost 160,000, accounting for 39 per cent of total foreign students at universities. The Chinese provided at least 20 per cent of revenue at institutions such as the universities of NSW and Sydney, and University of Technology Sydney. As one retired vice-chancellor said this week, many of the nation’s richest universities have been “sipping the Kool-Aid” without making sufficient efforts to diversify their enrolments and budgets. Their need to pursue alternative income sources is clear. After China, the largest number of overseas students come from India. But Indian students accounted for less than half the number of Chinese last year, followed by relatively small numbers from Nepal, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia.As well as being Australia’s fourth largest export behind coal, iron ore and natural gas, educating overseas students fosters vital bonds between Australia and well-educated people from other nations. While doing everything reasonable to cushion the impact of the travel bans on Chinese students, universities also must take a long-term view to broaden their financial and enrolment bases.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
A jobs survey provides hope of a faster recovery	The Australian	Until JobKeeper goes, the real jobless rate is a mystery In a deluge of depressing economic news the latest unemployment figures are a welcome, if surprising, relief. Far from rising significantly, as economists expected, the jobless rate dropped to 6.8 per cent from 7.5 per cent in July, the first decline since the start of the pandemic. More than 110,000 new jobs were created between July and August, the month Victoria crushed activity in the nation’s second-biggest state with a second, more severe lockdown to combat the coronavirus. Since June, the economy has recovered roughly half the jobs it lost between March and May, according to the latest labour force figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Capital Economics, an economic consultancy, said the unemployment rate was unlikely to climb to 8.5 per cent, as it had anticipated, let alone the 10 per cent predicted by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Treasury.
Whether on the epidemiological or economic front, it has not been a good year for forecasters. But dig a little deeper and some of the gloss comes off. Hours worked, a measure that pierces some of the confusion created by JobKeeper and JobSeeker — which see idle workers and some unemployed workers not counted — rose by only 0.1 per cent, dragged down by an unsurprising 4.8 per cent drop in Victoria. Separate real data — the ABS figures are based on a survey of about 25,000 households in the first two weeks of the month — from the Australian Taxation Office, which tracks business payrolls, suggests the number of jobs declined 1 per cent, or about 120,000, from July to August.
Most puzzling of all, all of the extra 111,000 jobs created across the month were “non-employees” — that is, contractors or sole traders. “We think delivery drivers contracted to the major online delivery companies drove today’s outcome,” Deutsche Bank economist Phil O’Donaghoe said. “There will have been a significant increase in demand for such workers, especially in Victoria during the month given lockdown conditions.” Roy Morgan, which conducts a separate unemployment survey, reckons the unemployment rate rose from 12.5 per cent to 13.8 per cent last month. Only when JobKeeper, with about 3.5 million recipients, is wound down and JobSeeker reverts to a lower level will we see the true impact of the coronavirus and our powerful response to it. That’s not far off. By the end of next week, both payments will have dropped $300 a fortnight. “These things can’t go off into the never-never and they have to be wound down,” Scott Morrison said, rightly, on Thursday. Not only do these payments add billions to public debt, they also reduce the incentive to look for work and create zombie businesses that ultimately must be wound down to adjust to the new economic reality.
The challenge for the government will be to hone the incentives to work by paring back support without seeming uncaring. It won’t be easy politically — business and welfare groups inevitably will demand that various support measures be extended — but it’s economically necessary to ensure the nation’s better starting position, especially on the fiscal front, isn’t entirely eroded during this unfortunate and unexpected experience. The coronavirus recession is likely to shift the pattern of household and business spending permanently, in unpredictable ways. Amid the new opportunities, many businesses will not survive. Nonetheless, a lower unemployment rate is a psychological win when business and household confidence is reeling. For the Morrison government, which is putting the finishing touches to the budget that will be handed down on October 6 and that will lay out the practical and philosophical path out of the coronavirus recession, it was particularly welcome. A better headline jobless rate also takes pressure off the Reserve Bank to pursue more extreme monetary policy, too. Better jobs figures provide a glimmer of hope, at least, that some sort of “snapback” is possible in the next year. The OECD has upgraded its growth forecast for Australia for this year, saying real GDP would contract by 4.1 per cent, or by 0.9 per cent less than it forecast in June. But it slashed projected growth for 2021 to 2.5 per cent, not 4.1 per cent as previously estimated. Whatever the outlook, Australia is in a better position than New Zealand, whose economy shrank 12.2 per cent in the second quarter of the year, almost twice as great a decline as Australia’s, which decreased 7 per cent across the same period.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Confidence will be vital in nation’s Covid comeback	The Australian	Vaccinations should be a boost for business, investment and jobs Compared with most nations, Australia has begun the vaccine rollout in a strong position. As of Saturday, the nation had 39 active coronavirus cases, including 25 in Victoria after the Holiday Inn outbreak was brought to heel. Nine people were in hospital with COVID across the nation and one person was in intensive care. No new locally acquired cases were reported. The Morrison government and medical authorities have been in the fortunate situation of not needing to rush out vaccinations to save lives. They have had time to learn from overseas experience and build community confidence in the program, after the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved the Pfizer vaccine in January and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine last week.
After a torrid 12 months, expectations are rising for a return to pre-COVID normal life and freedoms. Scott Morrison received his first jab at the Castle Hill Medical Centre in Sydney’s northwest on Sunday, where his comments further built up community hopes. “Every day that goes past from here gets more normal and that is what we have started today,” he said. “Our comeback from the COVID-19 pandemic is under way, and today we have just taken another massive step.” Most importantly, Australia has avoided the Prime Minister’s greatest fear — the “widespread fatalities that we saw overseas”. Australia has suffered 909 deaths from COVID-19, including 820 in Victoria, 54 in NSW, 13 in Tasmania, nine in Western Australia, six in Queensland, four in South Australia and three in the ACT. The contrast with Britain, for example, where a dire situation is finally improving, remains stark. More than 17 million people have had their first COVID shot in the UK. New cases have fallen from 60,000 to 10,000 a day and the number of deaths to about 445 a day. Worldwide, 110 million infections have resulted in almost 2.5 million deaths.
Australia is well positioned for a further economic rebound after unemployment fell in January from 6.6 to 6.4 per cent, and an increase in full-time jobs. But with underemployment of 8.1 per cent, youth unemployment at 13.9 per cent and JobKeeper to end in late March, serious challenges remain. Not unreasonably, business has sought assurances from the Morrison government that the long-awaited vaccine distribution program will avert further border closures by the states and the heavy costs they impose on the economy, Jamie Walker reports on Monday.
Last week, Mr Morrison raised hopes that international travel might be able to restart within months, depending on the success of the vaccines around the world. That would be a major boost for two of Australia’s major export earners, international education and tourism. With more than 200 million doses of vaccines distributed across the world so far, it makes sense for all nations, rich and poor, that the G7 powers are providing $7.5bn to help poorer nations buy vaccines. Much will depend on take-up rates.
But in Europe, scientists are warning that the world has reached a precarious point in the pandemic, in which conditions are ripe for the rise of more new coronavirus variants that could complicate efforts to control the disease. The virus is continuing to spread rapidly in many parts of the world, even as segments of populations have gained some immunity from being infected, or have been vaccinated. The scientists say the combination of high rates of viral transmission and a partially immunised population encourage the emergence of new variants.
In Australia, more than 60,000 frontline medical staff, quarantine workers and aged-care residents will be vaccinated this week. Under the government’s timetable, more than 800,000 people a week will be inoculated when the program ramps up, with a target of 4 million to receive an initial dose by the end of April. Most adults should be vaccinated by October.
One of the practical challenges is that businesses fear they will be stumbling through a minefield of liability if chief health officers do not order clear and consistent rules around COVID vaccination in the workforce. Industry Australia Group chief Innes Willox cites potential problems in guidelines released on Friday by Safe Work Australia on employer obligations. For example, employers may have to pay out workers’ compensation if employees contract COVID in their workplace, Ticky Fullerton reports on Monday. Yet mandating workers to be vaccinated brings liability risk to businesses. And requiring visitors or customers to bring proof of vaccination may give rise to privacy and discrimination issues. Business Council of Australia chief Jennifer Westacott says serious work needs to be done quickly on the issue, between government and business. The vaccine is not compulsory, a point that appears to be lost on hundreds of anti-vaxxers who gathered to protest in capital cities on Saturday. But it is the best potential game-changer we have against a once-in-a-century pandemic. The next few months will tell if COVID-19 is on the run. A year ago, as the pandemic was emerging, the probability of a vaccine being available in 12 months seemed remote. Provided it succeeds, it will be one of the most important triumphs of science for decades.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
When the world falls apart some things stay in place	The Australian	Values, strategy and natural advantages will get us through
Tuesday is supposed to be budget day, Josh Frydenberg’s annual set piece of taxing and spending. Last year the extravaganza was brought forward to April, effectively kicking off Scott Morrison’s sprint to an election the following month. It was the Treasurer’s first budget speech, with the opening couplet: “The budget is back in the black and Australia is back on track.” But drought, a US-China trade war, skittish markets, an investment strike and wary consumers kept growth in the year to December to an insipid 2.2 per cent. Still, as bushfires raged and the Prime Minister vacationed in Hawaii, Mr Frydenberg retained an optimistic view. “Australians can be confident about their economic future,” he said at the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook in mid-December. “With the first current account surplus in 40 years, welfare dependency at its lowest level in 30 years, the biggest tax cuts in 20 years and the first balanced budget in 11 years.” How the world changed.
A month earlier, the first reported patient infected with what was later named COVID-19 was found in Hubei. That was more than nine weeks before Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was put into lockdown on January 23. The next day almost all of Hubei province, with its population of almost 60 million, was cut off from China and the rest of the world. A week later, Mr Morrison announced a travel ban for foreigners travelling from China. We are still in social shutdown, our commerce in suspended animation, with gross domestic product expected to contract by a ruinous 10 per cent. Instead of fiscal maximus, on Tuesday the Treasurer is delivering an economic statement to parliament, no couplets but a sea of red ink. He is looking into a deficit abyss, with private forecasters tipping the cash shortfall to be $143bn this year and unemployment pushing past 10 per cent. In response, the government is spreading its welfare footprint far and wide: a doubling of the JobSeeker allowance, softer income-support means testing, the $1500 JobKeeper wage subsidy for battered businesses, and free childcare.
Mr Morrison vowed a “snapback” to normal from emergency measures, a fiscal pivot more easily said than done. Canberra’s money pit is finite, he maintains. Yet even on the most optimistic official forecasts, with restrictions eased sooner rather than later, the jobless rate won’t be back to its pre-crisis 5 per cent until mid-2022. Private economists say it could take two years beyond that to get back to this benchmark. The experience from the recessions of the early 1980s and 90s shows many workers will remain unemployed for years; some may be clocking off for good. Given the way the economy has been remade in the past three decades, rather than mature blue-collar men facing the blowtorch, it’s likely the displaced will be women and young people working in services. Labour-intensive industries such as retail and hospitality will not only be in distress, they also will be transformed in the post-COVID-19 world.
The Morrison government insists it wants a business-led, high-growth economy with rising living standards from a surge in productivity. The Prime Minister hinted on Monday that JobKeeper, which is meant to allow the economy to “hit the ground moving”, could be adjusted in the recovery phase. The government also is looking to harvest the best ideas from experts pushing for supply-side fixes. The broad shape of reform is well-known: a lower company tax rate, smarter regulation and more flexible workplaces. But the political will may be ephemeral. The Treasurer’s first budget did not set the reform crowd alight, this newspaper included. But it did have measures that could be deployed as a growth starter kit. Think tax breaks for investment, better skills training and capital works.
The seeds for more fundamental change, however, were sprinkled through Mr Frydenberg’s budget speech as he championed core values: aspiration, personal responsibility and choice, rewarding effort, risk-taking, thrift and an adequate safety net based on mutual obligation. To that you can add well-regulated markets and openness to the world as Coalition policy bedrock of the Liberal and National mainstream. We hope such values inform a growth strategy out of the coronavirus mire. Mr Frydenberg must also look to change the defensive, cautious psychology that has been necessary to flatten the infection curve. We’ll need a more positive, expansive mindset to get the economy’s motor running, to restore consumer and business confidence, to attract foreign capital and international students, and to entice local companies to innovate, invest, expand and hire workers.It’s likely we’ll be ahead of the global pack in recovery, perhaps swimming against a protectionist tide. The US maelstrom hurts investor confidence across the globe. So we need to go hard if not go it alone. By all means let’s not hinder people who want to take a risk with their own money and make things here. But tariffs and subsidies do not amount to a sustainable business model for Australian manufacturing. Let’s be sensible and remember “strategic” is likely to become the last refuge of the protectionist scoundrel or first call for high-plains grifters spruiking regional development or decentralisation. We already pay over the odds for military kit such as submarines, as important as those elements are to our security. But taxpayers will be saddled with debt for years, thanks to a cumulative run of budget deficits over four years expected to total $360bn. That’s why we need a fresh game plan that works for us, based on our rich endowments, world-beating advantages and longstanding values.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
The hallmarks of a police state	The Australian	Victoria has set the standard for mishandling the pandemic It’s a gruesome scenario most of us know only from films. Just a few people in Australia who have lived under the Nazis, the Stasi or China’s national security laws know the reality. The knock on the door, the fear and shock as police arrest someone in the home for a supposed crime against the state — often expressing a view contrary to the diktats of the ruling elite. This time last year, the idea that any Australian police force would arrest and handcuff a pregnant woman at home in her pyjamas, in front of her children, in a provincial city, for a Facebook post, would have defied credulity. The pandemic, however, has brought an incremental erosion of civil liberties, especially in Victoria. The heat has been turned up gradually, to the point Victorians are living a dystopian nightmare. House arrest for 23 hours a day, working (if they still have job) at home while they homeschool children; an 8pm curfew; isolation if they live alone; no visiting friends or family. Many people, understandably, are too fraught to add another worry — the encroaching police state — to their burdens. Others, alarmed that their state has crossed a dangerous line, are outraged. Professionals at the coalface, such as the medical practitioners who have signed a letter noting the dangers to citizens’ physical and mental health posed by restrictions, are increasingly concerned for the sick and vulnerable.
Apart from the Aussie accent, the only moment in the exchange with police at the Ballarat home of Zoe Buhler, 28, that felt remotely Australian was her partner, James Timmins, 21, appealing to police: “This is a bit unfair, come on, mate. What about she just doesn’t do the event?” The couple are worried about the health of their unborn child. Ms Buhler offered to take down the offending post, which promoted a “Freedom Day Ballarat” planned for Saturday, but to no avail. The police also said they were obliged to seize any mobile phone or computer: “Any device in this house we’re taking.” In a supposedly liberal democracy, the slide into authoritarianism is intolerable. Such a crude show of force suggests authorities are tone deaf to the public mood, or indifferent to it. The lack of an apology from Victoria Police or the government is telling. The Institute of Public Affairs, supporting Ms Buhler, says Victoria is a “police state”. Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius did little to disavow the public of that notion. He defended the arrest but, with astounding understatement, admitted the “optics” were “never going to look good”.
Like the Black Lives Matter protests in June, the anti-lockdown rallies planned for Saturday are dangerous, irresponsible and unconscionable. The high-handedness of Premier Daniel Andrews and the police has fuelled the anger. But those who want to protest should show the maturity and discernment to stay home. Turning out could endanger lives and health. It also may prolong stage-four restrictions. Mr Andrews has promised to tell Victorians on Sunday about his proposed road maps out of the restrictions for Melbourne and outside the city. The second wave of COVID-19 has cost 572 lives in Victoria and extracted a heavy economic and social price. After a crisis that arose mainly from his government’s egregious failures over hotel quarantining, and slow testing and tracing outcomes earlier on, Mr Andrews needs to ease the pressure as soon as possible. The public deserves better than the oppressive, prescriptive blueprint leaked to the Herald Sun. It suggested Melbourne’s stage-four lockdown and curfew would be extended for a fortnight. Dates for retail, hospitality and entertainment venues to reopen as soon as possible are essential. Mr Andrews’s power grab to extend the state of emergency for another year, which led to a compromise of six months thanks to “libertarians” such as Greens, Reason Party and Animal Justice MPs, set alarm bells ringing. Now the video of an expectant mum in handcuffs has ricocheted around the world, adding to the impression of a power-crazed regime. As the COVID crisis passes, the state needs to step back but copy the success of NSW in tracing, testing and isolation to keep the virus in check while Victorians get on with life. That is when the state of disaster abates.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Andrews’ ‘ring of steel’ costs more jobs each day	The Australian	Victoria must emulate the approach of NSW without delay Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews’ profoundly disappointing non-steps towards opening up his state, announced on Sunday, reflect his centrist “big government know best” mindset. They also show deep distrust. New COVID-19 cases in Victoria (one on Saturday, two on Sunday) are fewer than in NSW. But Mr Andrews does not appear to believe in the ability of his health system to keep the virus at bay through effective contact tracing. Nor does he trust the public to gather safely in restaurants, clubs and bars, to visit family and friends to watch Richmond and Geelong battle it out at the Gabba on Saturday or even to sit in a church, synagogue or mosque at a safe distance. At this stage, relaxing the 5km rule to 25km and allowing haircuts, golf games (but clubhouses remain closed) and opening swimming pools (with limited numbers) are token gestures. Retail and hospitality businesses will have to wait until next month to reopen. The hotel and restaurant sectors have good reason to be bitterly disappointed.
To the detriment of the state and national economy, Mr Andrews seems determined to impede the private sector from getting on with trading, making profits and providing jobs. He has urged frustrated business owners: don’t defy the rules and open up, come to us for help. The state budget, he promises, will be “unprecedented” in providing for economic repair. What he does not seem to grasp is that often the best thing governments can often do is get out of the way and let the private sector get on with business. As Business Council of Australia chief Jennifer Westacott warned on Sunday, easing social restrictions and extending the 5km rule to 25km is pointless if nothing is allowed open. For businesses hanging on by a day, not a week, the Premier’s strategy was inexplicable, as she said.
It is also increasingly erratic. On Saturday, Mr Andrews lashed out at federal Health Minister Greg Hunt for suggesting Victoria was ready to open up in line with the approach in NSW. Mr Hunt’s advice was insulting, Mr Andrews claimed. “Minister Hunt is not an epidemiologist,” he said. But Catherine Bennett, who holds the chair in epidemiology at Deakin University, also said Mr Andrews should have gone further. “Provided people are keeping to the rules when they go out, it doesn’t matter if they travel 25km or 50km or 100km as long as they stay within that defined boundary,” she said on Sunday. What mattered, Professor Bennett said, was that people understood whether what they were doing was safe.
At his press conference Mr Andrews struggled to explain the rationale for the 25km limit. His heavy-handedness is scant preparation for the day, which must come sooner rather than later, when Victorians cast off from the shore and begin living with the virus, taking sensible precautions while getting on with their work and their lives. The health, mental health and financial impact of Mr Andrews persisting with his “ring of steel” long past its use-by date will be profound, as Scott Morrison, Josh Frydenberg and Mr Hunt warned on Sunday. Every day Victoria remained under restrictions carried a heavy cost, they said. More than 1000 jobs had been lost, on average, every day. “There has also been a 31 per cent increase in mental health services being accessed under Medicare for the same four-week period up to October 11 in Victoria, compared with last year, while it has been only an 8 per cent increase in NSW and 7 per cent nationally.” The latest Business Outlook from Deloitte Access Economics notes Australia’s economy during the coming years is set to bounce back hard and fast from the COVID-19 shock. But Mr Andrews’ policies, unfortunately, are impeding that process for no good reason. When European nations increasingly are floundering with soaring COVID-19 infections, he is entitled to take pride in the fall in the state’s daily total of new infections from 725 to two. But hard on the heels of the hotel quarantine debacle, his government has made another terrible decision. Prolonging what remains one of the world’s strictest lockdowns, when daily cases have fallen to one or two, is an egregious error. It will cost 6.5 million Victorians dearly in terms of their finances and wellbeing. Irrational “we know best” centralism has run amok in our second-largest state. It is costing Victoria and the nation dearly. It must be reversed now.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Andrews must seek best advice	The Australian	Victoria needs its talented business leaders at the top table Hard cases make bad law, goes the legal aphorism. Global crises can make or break formal constitutions. Australia’s Constitution, not the product of revolution, has steered us through two World Wars and the Depression. So far, the coronavirus pandemic has been managed with common sense and pragmatism. The most obvious symbol of our ability to improvise in a crisis has been the relatively smooth operation of the national cabinet, which harnesses bipartisan goodwill and co-operation to defeat a common peril. It has no formal source of authority in the text of our founding instrument. That need not be a source of concern unless it makes decisions that flagrantly depart from the liberal democratic values on which Australia is founded.
As we have argued from the start, the arbitrary closure of borders by state governments is troubling. The founding fathers formed a nation, not a mere Customs union. The guarantee of “absolutely free” intercourse among the states is one of the most explicit in our founding document. Yet, especially in times of war and emergency, courts have extended considerable deference to the executive to make decisions that protect lives and property. COVID-19 is threatening lives, livelihoods and the social fabric. Regardless of the merits of the legal challenges to restrictions on interstate movement, we support the temporary extension of considerable latitude to federal and state leaders as the health, economic and psychological tolls of this pandemic mount.
In a spirit of generosity and pragmatism, Scott Morrison withdrew federal support to the legal challenge to Western Australia’s border closure. Likewise, the Prime Minister expressed solidarity with besieged Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews last month, declaring: “We’re all Melburnians now.” The nation depends on Victoria to succeed in containing outbreaks; suppressing the rate of community transmission of COVID-19 will lead to the removal of stage four measures, a return to work for many, resumption of commerce and repair of supply chains. To that end, Mr Andrews needs to adopt the same spirit of innovation and improvisation that has characterised the national response to the pandemic.
Victoria has entered its third period of lockdown. The relentless pressure of making life-and-death decisions must be taking a toll on Mr Andrews, who is front and centre of the response in the public’s mind and clearly the decider at the pointy end of things. Just as the Prime Minister expanded the sources of expert advice, so too must Mr Andrews. The Premier has carried too much of the burden. Whether that is a character trait or tacit concession his cabinet contains too many factional operatives, more adept at politics than policy, is moot. The highly factional nature of the Victorian ALP bestows considerable influence on trade unions. Yet business leaders clearly have been marginalised, as well as left confused as regulations proliferate. This does not lead to good policymaking and risks entrenching hostility and suspicion. Victoria should immediately establish its own version of a bipartisan, co-operative cabinet by bringing in talented leaders from the private sector. There are no constitutional constraints on a state government implementing an extra-parliamentary advisory body comprising experts beyond the public service and medical advisers. This newspaper has been highly critical of Mr Andrews, calling for quick action, openness, accountability and clearer messaging. We do not doubt his work ethic or genuine concern for the health and wellbeing of his citizens. The record of the Andrews government, however, does not inspire confidence. Limiting mobility and commercial activity in Victoria is a big step towards containing the virus. Success will come at a cost, while failure will cause further pain. But enhancing the sources of advice to the Premier is just as important as social restrictions. We are all Melburnians. Mr Andrews must avail himself of the brightest and best minds regardless of their political affiliation or occupation.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Come clean on Covid-19 fiasco	The Australian	Victoria should have accepted ADF help with quarantining When the history of Australia’s second wave of coronavirus is written, the Victorian government’s bungling of hotel quarantining will feature as a major turning point. In the current climate, blame games are of secondary importance in view of the health and economic challenges that continue to face authorities. But as the Andrews government continues digging itself into a deeper hole over its failure to take up offers of help by the Australian Defence Force, its shillyshallying is an insult to the public. It also has become a distraction from dealing with the pandemic. Retired judge Jennifer Coate is leading an inquiry into the quarantine program for returning travellers. But after appearing to mislead the public, Premier Daniel Andrews and Victorian Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp need to set the record straight. The public is entitled to know the facts because nothing less will clear the air.
In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Crisp said the ADF was involved in initial planning of the hotel quarantine program and attended meetings on March 27 and 28. But he said: “I did not seek nor did representatives of the ADF offer assistance as part of the hotel quarantine program.” But it was offered. On Wednesday Defence Minister Linda Reynolds, backed up by Defence Department records, confirmed that “hundreds of ADF staff” had been available to assist with hotel quarantine. The timeline published by The Australian on Thursday shows that on March 27 Scott Morrison announced mandatory quarantine for international arrivals. On the same day, Chief of the Defence Force Angus Campbell issued orders to deploy 100 ADF personnel in each large state. And Mr Andrews even issued a press release stating it had “been agreed that ADF will engage in support”.
Mr Andrews has compounded the damage this week, telling the Victorian parliamentary estimates inquiry on Tuesday: “I don’t believe ADF support was on offer.” Not only was it available, had it been put to good use the state and the nation would have been spared much of the second wave of COVID-19. That has claimed 255 lives since July 5 and resulted in more than 5000 new cases. And it led to the stage-four lockdown, which has increased the likelihood of a depression, destroying businesses and tens of thousands of jobs and costing taxpayers billions of dollars. As of Thursday, 664 people were in Victorian hospitals with the virus, including 44 in intensive care.
The first coronavirus infection linked to hotels was announced on May 27. By June 24 Mr Crisp had decided the quarantine program needed ADF support. In a written request to the ADF, obtained by The Australian, he asked for up to 850 military personnel “to provide compliance and monitoring support … at the hotels”. As Rachel Baxendale reports, Mr Crisp said: “Due to the scale and complexity of the crisis, this is a high-priority request.” He told the ADF that since March, Victoria had managed 18,500 individuals but had identified “a lack of access to skilled resources to undertake specific functions”. As Mr Crisp noted at the time, ADF personnel in other states “have proven to be uniquely suited to roles and functions being carried out within the current environment”.
But inexplicably, Mr Crisp rescinded the request within 24 hours. He needs to explain why. So does Mr Andrews, in light of subsequent disasters in Melbourne. They need not reserve their explanations for the Coate inquiry. It is not a court, as Ms Coate has pointed out, so there is no restriction on players commenting publicly or answering questions about matters relating to the quarantine program. Mr Andrews either has lost sight of the facts on the Morrison government’s offer of ADF support in March or, as Simon Benson speculated, he has “simply engaged in deliberate bamboozlement” to deflect some of the heat over quarantine mismanagement to Canberra. Either way, the war of words has further eroded disgruntled Victorians’ confidence in their government’s management of the COVID crisis.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
‘Cautious pause’ last straw for Andrews’ wasteland	The Australian	Victorians have had enough of driving 25km to nowhere
A “cautious pause’’, as Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews claimed? No way. His decision to delay relaxing restrictions is paralysis by diktat. The shutdown is costing $100m a day in lost GDP, 1200 jobs a day and $200m a day in federal taxpayer support. The cost to personal relationships, mental health and young people’s prospects is almost incalculable. After months of lockdown, most of it out of all proportion to the state’s COVID-19 situation, Sunday’s announcement has reinforced Melburnians’ deep economic and social funk. From the Morrison government to struggling businesses to Mr Andrews’ former health minister, Jenny Mikakos, the angry response to the delay, when Victoria’s seven-day average of new infections stands at 4.6, is palpable. Critics, including Scott Morrison, Josh Frydenberg and Health Minister Greg Hunt, point out Victoria’s public health systems “are either up to the task of dealing with future outbreaks or they are not. The decision to keep businesses closed suggests that there is still not sufficient confidence within the government that their systems can support reopening”.
That is a reasonable deduction. But Mr Andrews rejects it as “completely wrong’’. Questioned on Sunday about why NSW was able to remain open for months with a daily average of more than 10 new cases, at times he dodged the issue. His refusal to address the issue was inexcusable. If, as he claims, Victoria’s contact tracing process is up to the mark, and he has no doubts about it, his penchant for battening down our second-largest city can only be explained by his “command and control’’ centralist ideology.
But the lesson of recent months is big government is not necessarily better or safer. Nor can there be much doubt, as traders from the stylish Chapel Street precinct say, that the Andrews government does “not have business’ best interests at heart”. Mr Andrews has moved the goalposts, which was “shattering for businesses struggling to hold on’’, Melbourne Lord Mayor Sally Capp pointed out. The decision is especially harsh on the hospitality sector, which regards the delay as a “betrayal’’. Likewise the retail sector, for which hope has again turned to despair. Jennifer Westacott, chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, is correct when she says “we cannot go on like this … people are at a financial and mental breaking point”. It is inexplicable, as Ms Westacott says, that a state with comparable or lower case numbers than NSW cannot adopt the same best-practice system used in NSW and implement that state’s methods to contain local outbreaks.
Nobody is taking the pandemic lightly, especially on a day when Johns Hopkins University data showed a record 506,000 new infections across the world in 24 hours. Nor are business leaders or anyone else advocating a reckless, unsafe rush back to normality. To the contrary, living with localised outbreaks such as that in Melbourne’s northern suburbs will be fundamental to maintaining recovery when the state economy is finally opened up. When it does, Victorians cannot afford for Mr Andrews to panic and fold the state inward again at the first setback.
On Sunday, Mr Andrews cited pending results from 1000 COVID tests from Melbourne’s northern suburbs as his reason to retain restrictions. Of seven new cases in the state, six have been linked to the northern suburbs outbreaks and the other is a health worker. Based on experience in NSW, it should be manageable and containable, although there is no room for complacency. Later on Sunday, 1135 tests linked to that outbreak were returned negative. The 2500 swabs processed on Sunday confirmed three cases at the East Preston Islamic School. On those results, Mr Andrews should revisit the broader issue on Monday and announce a major reopening. As the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Mr Hunt point out, at some point, “you have to move forward and put your public health systems to work in a bid to reclaim the jobs … lost, and rescue the livelihoods and peace of mind of so many Victorians … affected by the inability to contain the outbreak that led to the second Victorian wave”. The national interest is also at stake. As Rosie Lewis reports, direct federal support for Victoria is set to reach $75bn, or a third of the total national COVID-19 payments so far. That compares with just $10bn in committed support from the Andrews government. After watching their beloved AFL grand final between two Victorian teams played 1770km away at the Gabba, Victorians will also watch on television as Derby Day, the Melbourne Cup, Oaks Day and Stakes Day are staged without racegoers. The silence in the home straight will not be as deafening as the quiet despair of Melburnians learning on Sunday that their deprivations are to continue, for a few days more, barring fresh excuses from Mr Andrews. Delays, maybes and apologies do not excuse Victoria’s failure to manage local outbreaks, as Ms Westacott says. It is taking too long and too much is being lost.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Bill to create police state has no place in this nation	The Australian	Victorians never imagined such a regime prevailing here
As the pandemic curve continues to flatten in Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews’s descent into dictatorial hubris deepens. A group of eminent retired jurists and senior counsel have expressed their alarm at the draconian measures contained in Mr Andrews’s draft COVID-19 Omnibus legislation. It effectively would transform Victoria into a police state, with all the odious trappings that entails. The human-rights zealots who proliferate in the law faculties of Victorian universities are curiously silent. Their obsession with retrospectively changing birth certificates for a tiny minority or ensuring the gender fluid may play female sport seems to have exhausted their sense of justice. They are strangely silent when it comes to the transformation of their state into a pallid version of East Germany. There, informers and collaborators assisted the authorities in tracing and incarcerating their fellow citizens without warrants, on the basis of prospective conduct — just as this bill envisages for Victoria.
On any measure, Mr Andrews’s latest foray into the suppression of his citizenry under the guise of suppressing a virus is repugnant. As well as violating long-cherished legal principles, it is un-Australian. It seeks to enlist the population as informers and arms of the state in rounding up others who are guilty of no offence. It would set a diabolically dangerous precedent and would be wide open to abuse. Even Mr Andrews’s most ardent supporters must repudiate this legislative overreach. So must the gaggle of single-issue crossbench dupes who rubber-stamped his diktat imposing the most severe lockdown in any democratic polity on earth. The bill raises significant questions. Whose idea was it? Who has been advising the Premier? Why does Mr Andrews deem it necessary to turn citizen against citizen? Where and for how long would citizens be held? Could they appeal to a court? How often would citizens, including pregnant women, be taken from their homes, in front of their children, and detained indefinitely?
A line has been reached. It must not be crossed. If the Legislative Council does not throw out this odious legislation, then the Morrison government should review the role of Australian Defence Force personnel in Victoria to ensure they are not used as police. The explicit denunciation of this legislation by former High Court justice Michael McHugh QC is significant. He was a moderate, punctilious member of the court who never fully embraced the implication of human rights and freedoms into the Constitution. He is the epitome of a black-letter lawyer rather than a judicial activist. Yet Mr McHugh is justifiably alarmed at the tenor and text of this bill.
It is beyond dispute that fundamental common law principles such as the presumption of innocence and recourse to the writ of habeas corpus were received into the Australian colonies and later into the federal Constitution and domestic common law. While rejecting a formal bill of rights akin to that in the US constitution, our founders were acutely aware that recourse to the great writ of habeas corpus and principles of legality were integral to Australian law. This abomination tramples on the letter and spirit of those principles. Until now, they have not been seriously questioned, even during the existential crisis of World War II. At no time has this pandemic constituted a threat akin to either world war. Now, as Victoria makes belated headway against a catastrophe that arose through cronyism and incompetence at the heart of the Andrews government, the time has come to ease restrictions rather than enact tyrannical laws. There has been too much hyperbole about this Premier from his supporters and detractors. But this legislation adds credence to the appellation “Dictator Dan”. To his blind army of fans on Twitter, Mr Andrews is beyond reproach. He is above the routine scrutiny required of every member of a democratically elected parliament. Journalists who legitimately seek information about his incompetent, opaque and increasingly authoritarian government are showered with vile abuse by the compassion police, whose virtues are ostentatiously displayed along with their preferred pronouns and consequence-free demands to free refugees. Indefinite detention, apparently, does not arouse their tender consciences. For decades, Melbourne’s culture has been deeply enriched by those who fled in search of freedom from the iron grip of various police states. Tear up this bill, Mr Andrews. It has no place in Australia.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Gobbo farce mockery of justice	The Australian	Victorians will suffer the effects of the scandal for years Former Victoria Police commissioners and serving senior police stand condemned over the Lawyer X scandal, which amounted to the worst police corruption in the nation’s history. The saga, elucidated in the submissions of Chris Winneke QC, counsel assisting the Royal Commission into the Management of Police Informants, casts grave doubt over the conduct of law and order in our second largest state. It also calls into question the convictions of a string of gangland figures and drug dealers serving long jail terms. It raises questions about the oversight of the former Victorian Labor governments. Above all, the debacle underlines the importance of accountability, transparency and a free press to safeguard the public interest.
Mr Winneke’s 3000 pages of submissions were released on Tuesday. The report by Royal Commissioner Margaret McMurdo QC, the former president of the Queensland Court of Appeal, is due in November. She will not recommend criminal charges be laid against anyone over the Lawyer X scandal, despite having the power to do so. The decision to leave it to the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether criminal charges should be brought looks to some like a cop-out. On the other hand, she argues, public discussion of whether individuals may have committed criminal offences “could unfairly prejudice any future trials”.
The fallout from the saga will be felt for years by long-suffering Victorians, whose confidence in their police force has been decimated by this and other serious scandals. The debacle has already cost taxpayers millions of dollars and is likely to cost far more. As Premier Daniel Andrews has said, some criminals may be eligible for compensation if they were wrongly convicted because of information supplied by Nicola Gobbo, the former barrister turned supergrass. The royal commission has identified numerous such potential beneficiaries, including convicted drug lord Tony Mokbel, a former client of Ms Gobbo. Convictions secured over the notorious tomato tin ecstasy bust are also in jeopardy.
In June 2007, Victoria Police and Australian Federal Police made the world’s largest ecstasy haul when they uncovered 15 million pills inside tomato paste tins shipped from Italy. The bust led to a string of career criminals being convicted. But as Mr Winneke noted in his submissions, Ms Gobbo had acted for at least 10 of the accused and her double life as criminal lawyer and police snitch may have affected the prosecution of 32 of the accused.
In 2010, unbeknown to the public, Ms Gobbo received $2.88m in compensation after bringing a lawsuit against Victoria Police. And in their desperate endeavours to keep their conduct secret, the police squandered millions of dollars to force Melbourne’s Herald Sun newspaper, which broke the story of Lawyer X on March 31, 2014, to bury it, to the immense detriment of the public interest. On Wednesday, The Australian’s Victorian editor, Damon Johnston, who was the Herald Sun’s editor at the time, recounted how, at vast expense, the paper fought more than 20 legal battles with Victoria Police, which was intent on suppressing the story. On one occasion the paper was ordered to stop its presses; on another it was barred by the Victorian Supreme Court from using the “Lawyer X” pseudonym. The paper persevered, knowing the public had a right to know about the matter.
The Herald Sun demonstrated the vital role of a vigorous free press as a watchdog when official government watchdogs prove toothless. Quality news gathering is costly, which is why it must never be pilfered by internet giants such as Google and Facebook. The Herald Sun exposed the dark heart of the entrenched problems in Victoria Police. These remained despite the efforts of the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission and its forerunner, the Office of Police Integrity. As Mr Winneke noted, a series of reviews and inquiries over 20 years had identified deficiencies in the force’s management of informers and in its culture and leadership. Inquiries into the drug squad in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2007, for example, found “lack of accountability and supervision that tended to enable noncompliance, misconduct and corruption”. The Andrews government and police chiefs have far to go to prevent further corruption and rebuild trust.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Risk aversion comes with a heavy cost to the state	The Australian	Victoria’s Daniel Andrews needs to have confidence in his team
The 800 deaths caused by the failure of Victoria’s hotel quarantine scheme last year have scarred the ability of Premier Daniel Andrews to make decisions on how best to deal with further outbreaks. Given the catastrophic results that flowed from the Andrews government’s incompetence, forensically detailed by the Coate inquiry report, it is understandable that Mr Andrews is hyper-vigilant to ensure there is no repeat performance. The problem is fresh trauma being visited on 6.5 million people, now under the third hard lockdown in Victoria, will have serious consequences as well. There is in Victoria a collective trauma triggered by systemic incompetence that is being compounded by a lack of trust. Mr Andrews says he is acting on the advice of his top health officials, but it is clear the Premier has difficulty letting go. As a result, Mr Andrews appears to be acting contrary to the good news being delivered by his contact tracing team.
The goodwill he once enjoyed, despite the experience of the second lockdown, is wearing thin. ABC reporter Leigh Sales cut straight to the chase on Monday when she asked Mr Andrews how it was the case that the government still lacked such confidence in the hotel quarantine systems that it couldn’t manage two cases. “Lockdown imposes a real cost and Victorians have already paid a big price for lockdown. Cases are actually very well traced, so why the lockdown?” Sales asked. Mr Andrews’ first response was to shoot the messenger and highlight the extra potency of the UK variant of the virus. But health editor Natasha Robinson reported on Saturday that the UK variant was not 70 per cent more infectious, as we were told. It’s not even 50 per cent more infectious. According to the most authoritative source of data on the detailed epidemiology of transmission risk, British government executive agency Public Health England, a person who is infected with the UK variant of coronavirus is about 34 per cent more infectious. On the substance of Sales’ question, Mr Andrews said: “I am more than confident in the team we have and in the Victorian community that they can get through this.” And so he should be.
On Monday, Victorian commander of testing Jeroen Weimar provided a detailed account of the positive cases, how and when they caught the virus, and where they’ve been in the community. Starting from a family of three returned travellers believed to have contracted COVID-19 overseas, the virus infected others in the quarantine facility and from there leaked out into the community. Mr Weimer explained the progress of contact tracing and confirmed that in most cases close contacts had tested negative or had been put into isolation. From this perspective, the situation in Victoria is no different to what has happened in other states, including NSW, which so far has not imposed a statewide lockdown.
Instead, Mr Andrews has used the latest outbreak to question the feasibility of the quarantine system as part of what appears to be an orchestrated campaign to push greater responsibility on to the Morrison government. We believe this push should be seen for what it is, a political stunt. When the issue was raised by the national cabinet, state leaders insisted they retain control of the quarantine system. Given that health is a state government responsibility, this is as it should be. The bigger question is why has so much of the load been allowed to fall on NSW. According to figures published on Tuesday, since the implementation of the hotel quarantine program on March 28 last year, NSW has taken almost half of all arrivals. Compared with NSW’s 124,893 quarantine arrivals, Victoria took 35,666, Queensland took 41,395, South Australia 10,955 and Western Australia 30,060.
Mr Andrews needs to regain his confidence and make better decisions. Former Liberal premier Jeff Kennett spoke for many Victorians when he said he was prepared to give Mr Andrews the benefit of the doubt but felt he had been lied to again. He said the UK variant did not spread as fast as people had been told and the lockdown was to protect politicians, not the people. “Be assured the reason we are in lockdown is because the Premier has no confidence in the administration of Victoria’s hotel quarantine, nor his contact tracing,” Mr Kennett said. “We Victorians, but those in particular who had been planning weddings, parties, sporting events, going to restaurants, not to mention the hundreds of restaurants who must throw out millions of dollars’ worth of food, are paying a huge price for the government’s incompetence once again.” John Ferguson wrote on Monday that Mr Andrews was making a political and health calculation that a five-day pause was better than a months-long shutdown. Given Mr Andrews’ experience with quarantine failure, two extended lockdowns and 800 tragic fatalities last year, we understand his caution. However, with only limited cases and a confident contact tracing team, he should end the lockdown and follow the example of NSW in managing clusters. For Victorian residents and business owners, the insecurity of not knowing when another lockdown is coming will have a profound long-term impact on the state. Mr Andrews’ risk aversion comes with a heavy price attached.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine

It’s time for Dan Andrews to seek more outside help	The Australian	Victoria’s Premier can’t win in solo combat and needs allies Given the monumental challenges facing Victoria as it attempts to navigate its way out of harsh COVID-19 lockdown measures, it is possible to have some compassion for Premier Daniel Andrews. Despite his authoritarian response, poor consultation and reluctance to seek expert help from outside his state, Mr Andrews no doubt is motivated by a desire to keep people safe.
The point has been reached, however, to acknowledge that events in Victoria are out of control and the costs and benefits from continuing the tough measures as outlined by Mr Andrews in his road map must be assessed more fully. It is time for Victoria to accept an intervention. This may be a difficult position for the Premier and his small band of advisers to accept, but now more than ever Victoria needs support, guidance and assistance from experts outside of their immediate sphere.
The admission by Mr Andrews’s top health official, Brett Sutton, that the Victorian government did not discuss the state’s coronavirus road map with the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the peak national public health emergency body, before it was announced on Sunday is a concern. Professor Sutton said no one had as good a view of Victoria’s industry, population and epidemiology as the state officials involved in devising the road map. Likewise, Mr Andrews’s public assurance that the state’s supercomputer knows best is further evidence that the Premier needs to expand his view.
The road map outlined by Mr Andrews on Sunday promises weeks more lockdowns, curfews and restrictions that pose an uncertain future for Victorian households and industry. This must be considered the worst-case scenario, but the messaging with which the road map was delivered inspires little confidence that Victorians will be out of lockdown for Christmas.
The strain of the second wave of infections in Victoria and the missteps by government clearly are taking their toll on the Premier, who has overly personalised the challenge of confronting the pandemic. Mr Andrews is wasting energy putting himself out in public each day when he should be working to gain a better and broader perspective. The Premier needs to lessen the pressure on himself and share responsibility more. For business, he must disentangle himself from the hold of the health bureaucracy and immediate events to be able to look beyond the horizon.
The key performance indicators for Professor Sutton are, rightly, to reduce infections and casualties at all costs. These are KPIs that are not necessarily shared by Mr Andrews.
For guidance, Mr Andrews can look to NSW where, given the numbers of COVID-19 infections, citizens would be locked down under Victoria’s plan. Instead, in NSW there is no curfew, shops are open and the economy is rebuilding, with 314,000 jobs that were gone in the first lockdown now back. Mr Andrews has said the situations in NSW and Victoria are not comparable, but if there is a key difference it is in the quality and efficiency of contact tracing that has allowed NSW to avoid having to impose a community-wide lockdown.
The failings of the Victorian government when the second-wave outbreak surfaced are well documented. More important is what has happened in the past five weeks of lockdown in Victoria and why there still are cases that cannot be accounted for. This suggests poor data handling and a contact-tracing regime that is not up to scratch. Shortcomings in these areas have been covered over by more restrictive measures that might well promise greater and costlier long-term consequences. It may be easier for government to impose a one-size-fits-all approach rather than identifying hotspots and Mr Andrews may be correct that having a curfew makes things easier for police, but that is not the point. What is easier is not necessarily right.
Ultimately, health is a state responsibility and, to date, Scott Morrison has been charitable in his comments and offers of help for Victoria. But what happens in Victoria matters nationally and there are signs that commonwealth patience is wearing thin. As national affairs editor Simon Benson has written there are now fundamental disagreements between the commonwealth, including medical experts, and the Andrews government.
The image being presented from Canberra is that the Andrews government has no idea how to manage the crisis and has become fixated on managing the spin. The message is that the federal government is unwilling to pick up the bill for Victoria’s continuing incompetence. Mr Andrews needs help and he must be willing to accept the best available from other states and nationally. It is the compassionate thing to do for the millions of Victorians who are quickly losing faith in what their tomorrows may hold.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Getting criminal appeals right	The Australian	Victoria’s appellate court has a record of being overturned
The contrast is stark. In its first decade Victoria’s Court of Appeal came under scrutiny by the High Court on 17 occasions involving criminal matters, far less often than its NSW counterpart, and its decisions were reversed only twice. Since 2005, when Chris Maxwell was sworn in as its second president, Victoria’s appellate court underwent review by our highest court 37 times and had to be corrected in 16 criminal cases, according to analysis by the state’s former chief crown prosecutor, Gavin Silbert. And this predated the High Court’s devastating 7-0 reversal of the Maxwell court’s decision to uphold Cardinal George Pell’s conviction, as Victorian editor Damon Johnston reported.
Correction on appeal is part of the system but Mr Silbert’s article in the Australian Law Journal highlights some disturbing features of the court’s record since 2005. Sentencing is identified as a particular problem with an “auction-like” regime where the judge fields competing bids for prison terms from the prosecution and defence. While consistency is a legitimate aim, in practice the regime seems to have led to disquietingly lenient sentences. In a case involving child incest offence with a 25-year maximum term, the sentence set was for three years and six months. It’s important the punishment be seen to fit the crime. Also worrying is a pattern of decisions at odds with established High Court authority, and even with past rulings of the Victorian Court of Appeal itself. In one murder case, the result was an unwarranted order for a retrial, with the High Court having to intervene to reinstate the conviction. If courts do not follow binding precedent, it is potentially damaging for public confidence in the rule of law, quite apart from a failure to do justice according to law in a serious criminal case where the stakes are high. Victoria’s Court of Appeal performed well under its first president, John Winneke. He was an establishment figure appointed by the Kennett government in 1995 but his broad legal qualifications were not in dispute. These included solid experience in criminal law, and his expert advocacy was vital during the Morling royal commission into the miscarriage of justice in Lindy Chamberlain’s case. Justice Maxwell is also an establishment type and one of many appointments by former Labor attorney-general Rob Hulls. These took place at a time when it was becoming more common, especially for Labor governments, to draw judges from more “diverse” backgrounds, including law reform and academe. Justice Maxwell’s legal progressive pedigree included a stint with Liberty Victoria. Nothing wrong with that, and his influence on a multi-judge appeal court should not be overstated. But it’s notable that the only judge on his court to recognise the flaws in the Pell trial was one with considerable experience in criminal law: Justice Mark Weinberg. Criminal matters are central to the function of state appeal courts, and it’s only right that there be informed public debate about whether these cases are being decided correctly.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Reason abandoned in a senseless Covid-19 panic	The Australian	Victoria’s bureaucratic overkill is treating its citizens with contempt
Road safety guidelines for long-distance motoring is consistent between states, including Victoria: Stop, revive, survive — for 15 minutes every two hours. We would much rather serve you a cup of tea than cut you out of a car. If you experience feeling sleepy, tired or exhausted while driving, you need to stop. Get out of the car, breathe fresh air, stretch your legs.
Unless you’re heading for Victoria in a mild COVID -19 outbreak, apparently. The state’s COVID response commander, Jeroen Weimar, suggested on Tuesday that Victorians stranded in Queensland drive home. “You stop twice on the way, you stop for 15 minutes, you have a mask on, you keep your social distance,” he said. “It is a long way, but having done Cameron Corner (close to the Queensland-NSW- South Australian border) to Mildura in a day, I don’t think it’s an exceptionally impossible drive to do.’’ Most of those returning, however, would have much farther to travel, from the Sunshine or Gold coasts to Melbourne. Much also depends on the driver, the vehicle, the road, passengers and prevailing conditions. For many, breaking the journey overnight, or taking longer and more frequent breaks, would be safer.
Not for the first time during the pandemic, the Andrews government’s autocratic heavy-handedness is undermining the wellbeing of Victorians. At a glacial pace, a team or 30 or 40 is processing applications for exemptions to the state’s disruptive and unnecessary border closure with NSW. At last count, 295 exemptions had been given with 3452 waiting. That is the tip of an iceberg. Many others have not applied. Some do not consider themselves special cases; others have found it impossible to make contact by phone. Janet Yarrington, 60, from Neerim East, east of Melbourne, is one. She went to Sydney in late November when her 90-year-old father was dying. When Victorian Acting Premier Jacinta Allan announced on New Year’s Eve that the state’s border would close to anyone coming from NSW from 11.59pm on January 1, Ms Yarrington, like many Victorians, was not in a position to return home. Her 90-year-old mother could not be left alone. But now Ms Yarrington needs to return to mind her grandchildren so her daughter can resume work. She deserves better than being answered by a machine, told to press “2”, and then cut off.
Those stranded in limbo are sitting out the wait in NSW, incurring expenses as they worry they will not make it home in time for work or the start of the school year on January 27. Victoria’s sclerotic bureaucracy will be tested further as the end of the holidays draws closer. It remains to be seen if Scott Morrison has been able to persuade Premier Daniel Andrews, who is on holiday, to see reason and open the border or smooth the situation. It is a faint hope.
While it would be tedious but at least understandable during a real emergency, the imposition of such restrictions on movement within a sovereign nation is intolerable. It is wrong on principle, and in the present situation is ludicrous. In the 24 hours to Wednesday morning, the number of locally acquired COVID-19 cases across Australia was not in the thousands, the hundreds or even double digits. It was four in NSW, and one in Victoria. One person from each of those states was in hospital; nobody, anywhere in Australia, was in intensive care with COVID-19.
As was the case with Victoria’s draconian lockdown and curfew, accompanied with spying drones, the Andrews government’s approach will create social, medical and economic problems. As Liberty Victoria president Julia Kretzenbacher told Rachel Baxendale, the policy is causing real stress and problems for people stranded away from home. Other options, such as testing followed by home quarantining, need to be considered. That is, if thousands of people who have not been in known hotspots need to be isolated at all.
While the economy is recovering well from the pandemic, unreasonable border closures are costing business and jobs in sectors such as tourism and hospitality. The longer the closures continue, the greater the disruption to these and other sectors when the nation is already facing a budget deficit of $197.7bn this financial year and gross debt of more than $1 trillion later in the decade.
While Commonwealth Bank chief economist Stephen Halmarick is optimistic about the economy this year, he says a continuation of border closures after the Australia Day weekend, when normal business travel should resume, would be problematic. Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley says the border will not reopen for weeks. Not good enough. Last year, politicians and health officials agreed that until a vaccine was in place, ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks were inevitable. Containment rather than elimination was seen as the best strategy; it was important to avoid panic. That, unfortunately, is what the latest border fiasco by the Andrews government is creating, as well as anger and anxiety. Despite long queues, testers and contact tracers in all states are doing a sterling job. Members of the public have repeatedly shown they are prepared to be sensible. They deserve better. This shambles must be resolved and attention switched to a far more serious issue: strengthening international travel processes as more people arrive with the highly infectious super strain that has shut down Britain.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Picking up the Covid pieces	The Australian	Victoria’s long lockdown took a heavy toll on mental health On Wednesday, while South Australia plunged into a six-day lockdown and Victoria recorded its 19th straight day with no new cases of coronavirus, the alarming human cost of Victoria’s four-month lockdown, one of the toughest in the world, continued to emerge. While harder to quantify than the economic fallout, the hidden toll, especially among young people, is grim. Doctors are identifying a new wave of mental health problems among young people, Victorian editor Damon Johnston reports. On Monday, Rebecca Urban revealed that thousands of Victorian students had stopped attending class or completing schoolwork by remote learning by the end of the state’s extended lockdown, sparking fears many could drop out of education for good. Some schools are trying to track more than 50 students.
From August to October, Johnston reports, 16 teenagers who had self-harmed were rushed to the Monash Children Hospital’s intensive care unit in critical conditions. The number was a significant increase on five self-harm cases treated at the hospital in the corresponding period last year. The mental health and educational problems being identified are complex and will take many months, if not longer, to address. The waiting list for the Andrews government’s Navigator program, for example, which supports students who are at risk of not completing schooling, has blown out to six months. With the end of the school year fast approaching, many schools are struggling to contact dozens of students who dropped off the radar as remote learning stretched across most of term two and all of term three — more than 20 weeks — for 160,000 students in years 8 to 10. That age group has paid a high price for the lockdown, considering few were likely to contract serious doses of the virus.
Suburban general practitioners also are finding adult patients struggling with anxiety, exhaustion and feelings of being unable to cope after months of being disengaged from family and friends. Worries about exposing children to the virus now that the lockdown is over remain a problem for some parents, as is helping younger children readjust to leaving and then returning to daycare. For many families, life will not return to normal until workers are encouraged to return to their workplaces from home.
Given the widespread harm done, Premier Daniel Andrews has pledged a major investment in mental health in next week’s budget. Almost $870m will be spent, including $492m for 120 new mental health beds in Melbourne, outer metropolitan centres and Geelong. What is also important, as doctors, paediatricians and adolescent mental health experts emphasised to The Australian, is that similar draconian lockdowns be avoided in the event of a third coronavirus wave in Victoria. Other jurisdictions need to take note of the Victorian experience with a long-term stringent lockdown and avoid it. The danger from Victoria’s second wave of COVID-19 has passed, but the nightmare is continuing for many. The hidden mental health and educational toll of the Andrews government’s lockdown underlines the importance of other responses to outbreaks, especially widespread testing, the provision of rapid results and efficient contact tracing. The Marshall government has launched a short, sharp lockdown to break the back of a fast-replicating virus cluster in South Australia. But it must do better than making people queue for hours to be tested.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Rating agency’s warning on perils of runaway state debt	The Australian	Victoria’s spending has put its AAA credit rating in jeopardy
As the post-COVID economic recovery gathers pace, state governments, always eager to spend, are putting the Reserve Bank of Australia’s advice into practice. In August, RBA governor Philip Lowe advised that “by borrowing today to support the economy we are avoiding an even bigger loss of output and jobs that would damage our economy and society for years to come, which would put ongoing strain on the budget”. Delivering the NSW budget a fortnight ago, Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said record low interest rates were “ a golden opportunity’’ to get the economy moving. Doing nothing, he said, would inflict long-term damage on future generations.
That said, the quality as well as the quantity of government stimulus spending are both important. And credit ratings agencies have sounded a timely warning about the “dire’’ state of Victoria’s public finances. The nation’s second-largest state, Adam Creighton reports, could be stripped of its AAA rating within weeks. S&P Global Ratings is concerned about the Andrews government posting what is “likely the largest ever” deficit of any AAA-rated government in the world. Any downgrade would be the first for an Australian government for seven years. It would leave the commonwealth, NSW and the ACT as the only AAA-rated governments in the country.
Anthony Walker, S&P’s top sovereign analyst for Australia, notes Victoria is increasing borrowing substantially more than NSW, relative to its balance sheet. Victoria’s 2021 deficit, he told Creighton, could be equivalent to more than 50 per cent of its revenue, “likely the largest-ever deficit seen for a AAA-rated (state) government”. The state’s financial picture is related to the coronavirus pandemic. The second lockdown, Moody’s analyst John Manning says, cost Victoria an extra $21bn in borrowings. But government policies and priorities are also a major influence. State and provincial governments in Canada and Germany, which suffered more from the coronavirus pandemic than Victoria, are forecasting deficits of between 10 and 20 per cent, S&P Global points out.
Victoria’s budget forecast a surge in net debt from $44bn in June 2020 to $155bn by 2024, compared to a forecast increase to $104bn by 2024 for NSW. Queensland, which lost its AAA credit rating in 2009, delivers its budget on Tuesday. After years of profligate spending, it is encouraging that Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick promised on Sunday that his first budget’s “debt numbers … will be lower than NSW and Victoria”. New borrowing would be significant but reasonable, he said. A return to the disciplined approach of the Goss/De Lacy years of the early 1990s would restore Queensland’s path to prosperity.
Apart from the three years of the Newman LNP government (2012-15), growth in public sector wages has been a major contributing factor in Queensland’s ballooning debt. The same problem has reared its head in Victoria, never more than in last week’s budget, when the state’s public sector wages bill was forecast to rise by 21 per cent over the forward estimates, through recruitment and pay rises. In the current financial year, employee expenses are set to balloon by an astonishing 9.5 per cent, at a time when community wages growth is likely to be about 1 per cent. Victoria’s investment in long-term, productive infrastructure, however, is sound, especially the CBD-Melbourne Airport link that is being backed by the Morrison government.
Once lost, AAA credit ratings take years of disciplined cost cutting, revenue raising or asset sales and leases to restore as debt is paid down. Such options, especially tax rises, are politically unpopular. The problem will eventually become more expensive for taxpayers when interest rates rise, forcing states with poorer credit ratings to pay more for finance.
State and territory finances will also come under pressure in coming years with an expected decline of about $25bn in GST revenues over the three years to 2022-23 compared with what had been expected before the pandemic, Patrick Commins reports on Monday. The health crisis has “basically blown a big hole in state finances”, ANZ economist and budget specialist Cherelle Murphy told The Australian. The loss of revenue would further complicate the recovery from COVID as well as the fiscal repair after this year’s big-spending budgets. In the current economic climate, a recent report about Queensland from Deloitte Access Economics offered advice that is applicable to all states. Increasing debt, it said, needed to be “used for good”, with decisions on spending and recovery geared to a competitive economic agenda on the right scale.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Cook’s mighty endeavour transformed the world	The Australian	Viewed from ship or shore, it was a defining moment
Captain James Cook had been dead for nine years in 1788 when governor Arthur Phillip established the British penal colony that was to become modern Australia. But the humble farmer’s son from Yorkshire who came ashore at Botany Bay 250 years ago holds a stellar place in our nation’s pantheon. The journey up the uncharted east coast of the continent was part of a hazardous three-year exploration for the Endeavour, a three-masted wooden coal carrier that was little bigger than a tennis court. It carried 94 crew. Cook’s voyage, historian Geoffrey Blainey wrote in The Australian earlier in the year, was testament to Europe’s fascination with science, with the captain “a kind of astronaut who arrived by sea’’. The first destination was Tahiti because the island cluster was favourable for observing the transit of Venus, a rare astronomical event on June 3, 1769, that would not reoccur for 105 years. Observing it from different standpoints around the globe would give navigators vital information. Cook’s instructions were, after leaving Tahiti, to search for what was believed to be the Great South Land, a continent “missing” ­from the map and believed to be rich in treasure and tropical plants. The French were set on the same quest.
Three years after setting out, the Endeavour arrived back in Britain laden not with gold or silver but with a new world of knowledge that transformed mathematics, navigation, geology, geography, botany, nutrition, psychology, astronomy, medicine, cartography and languages, Trent Dalton writes on Wednesday. Fresh insights and a mass of new plants came from Botany Bay, where Cook anchored for just over a week. The sojourn allowed botanist Joseph Banks and others to explore the surrounding bushland creeks, scrub and grasslands. The stop also gave the Endeavour’s nanny goat, provider of milk to the crew, a chance to graze after two years at sea. The crew later saw their first kangaroo, their Anglicised name for the animal the natives called gangurru, near what is now Cooktown. It was “cooked for our dinners”, Banks noted.
Scott Morrison — whose electorate, named after Cook, includes the landing spot — is right when he says this anniversary represents a merging of histories. The continent’s indigenous people had arrived 60,000 years earlier and we honour their resilience, wisdom, custodianship and stewardship. Indigenous culture is a fundamental element of modern Australia. The coming of Cook’s party, as the Prime Minister said, marked “a point in time from which we embarked on a shared journey, which is realised in the way we live today. Our shared history tells the story of all of us”. From that historic day onwards there has been, as lawyer Noel Pearson has written about Australia Day, two perspectives: “From eyes on board ship, this was a settlement, and from eyes on shore, an invasion.” Cook’s descendant, Kate Cook, who lives in Melbourne, told Dalton: “If this date becomes an opportunity for our nation to advance further, together, then that would be an incredible result.” Commemorations of Cook’s 126-day journey along the east coast, from Point Hicks in Victoria to Cape York atop Queensland, have been contained by the COVID-19 restrictions. But plenty of online resources — from the National Museum of Australia, the Australian National Maritime Museum and the National Library of Australia — provide an overview of an important chapter of our history. A mature perspective of such milestones is vital to national unity and self-understanding. Cook’s world-beating exploration, through which he remained unpretentious, was a stellar achievement of which Australia and Britain, especially his beloved Yorkshire, should be very proud. It was in Yorkshire that Cook started work in a shop in Staithes, a seaside village where he learned to sail. Puerile critics’ claims that we should not commemorate this anniversary are beyond contempt.As the Endeavour sailed along what is now the southern NSW coast, Banks wrote of seeing “smoak’’, which suggested the natives knew how to manage bushland. He recognised the continent’s vast potential. With their intrepid, adventurous spirits, Cook and his crew would delight in how those who came after them grasped that potential to build a great nation.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Covid at a critical turning point	The Australian	Vigilance, prevention and quality PPE are needed The fall in Victoria’s daily caseload of new COVID-19 infections to six on Thursday, with no further deaths, bears out the sense in federal Health Minister Greg Hunt and Josh Frydenberg’s call for Premier Daniel Andrews to “give the people of Victoria their freedom back this weekend”. There is no longer any medical justification, as the Morrison government’s two most senior Victorians argued, for the forced closure of pubs, shops, restaurants and offices. Keeping Melbourne’s five million people confined to their homes will only prolong the economic, health and community agony caused by the lockdown, as Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox says. As Remy Varga reports on Friday, Melbourne’s lockdown is fuelling family violence. Demand for mental health services across the state, including for children and teenagers, has soared in recent months.
With new cases in Victoria at slightly more than half the 11 new cases in NSW on Thursday there is no reason to keep our second-largest state locked down. But that is not to suggest there is room for complacency in either state, or anywhere else around the nation. Australia is at a critical turning point. Our nation’s worst nightmare would be a fresh wave similar to that devastating Britain and much of Europe, which has put many communities back to where they were in March. Indications are that we are far from on top of managing potential outbreaks effectively.
The stoicism of hundreds of people queuing for up to six hours for COVID testing in Shepparton on Wednesday was admirable. But expecting them to wait for hours in the sun was not good enough. Extra testing capacity was rushed to Shepparton. But the length of the lines showed that more was needed. Hundreds more local people turned out for testing early on Thursday, showing their willingness to help keep the virus at bay. Mr Andrews’ frustration with the truck driver responsible for spreading the virus through regional Victoria is justified. Given the danger, the temporary lockdown of Shepparton was good strategy.
Post-lockdowns, as the nation learns to live with the virus through vigilance, prevention and good management of outbreaks and individual cases, the issues raised by health editor Natasha Robinson on infection control must be also addressed. Anaesthetist Andrew Miller, head of the Australian Medical Association in Western Australia, says healthcare workers should be wearing head-to-toe suits as in Asian countries. The issue needs to be assessed and resources committed to ensure the safest possible protocols are followed. As a nation, we have the resources to do so. The high rate of healthcare worker infections in Melbourne, where almost 3600 healthcare workers have been infected in the city’s second wave of coronavirus, is a serious concern. So is the fact, as Melbourne infectious diseases doctor Michelle Ananda-Rajah says, that staff who have raised concerns about inappropriate personal protective equipment have faced “bullying and censorship”. Similar concerns surely apply to staff in nursing homes. While Australia, in general, has done well in managing COVID, the death rates in nursing homes are high. Nor is it good enough, as Victorian parliament has been told, that doctors and nurses are still waiting to be fit-tested for N95 face masks, despite working in high-risk COVID-19 transmission settings. Nor, as Victorian Ambulance Union secretary Danny Hill says, have many ambulance workers — including those who transport COVID-positive patients — been fit-tested for masks. Attention to such detail is vital to protect lives and spare local communities and the nation from catastrophic relapses.	4	disease transmission; transmission covid19; pandemics disease
Russia does not need a new tsar	The Australian	Vladimir Putin is a nefarious player in the world’s oil crisis
Carefully choreographed moves in the Russian Duma clearing the way for Vladimir Putin to rule for another 16 years, past his 83rd birthday, are no surprise. Neither is the assessment by Russian opposition leader Alex Navalny that the subservient Duma has turned Mr Putin into a latter-day “tsar”. That conclusion will fuel apprehension in the West about what lies ahead, given Mr Putin’s record as the world’s malevolent disrupter-in-chief.
His penchant for troublemaking has put him front and centre of the oil price war that has exacerbated the world’s financial and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus. When Saudi Arabia called for production cuts to mitigate oversupply and prop up prices in view of the slowdown in China, Mr Putin pounced. He shocked the world by terminating his country’s shaky alliance with OPEC, refusing to back the Saudi-led cartel’s initiative to maintain prices. His move was clearly aimed at wresting market share back from US shale oil companies, which are heavily reliant for their survival on maintaining higher oil prices. Mr Putin has prioritised the interests of his Russian oligarch cronies, who have grown immensely rich under his rule. Nor has he forgiven US “frackers”, whose debt-fuelled growth caused Russia to lose its position in 2018 as the world’s largest oil producer. He is also hitting back against US sanctions imposed in response to Moscow’s abuses in international affairs, including Russian’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its behaviour in the Middle East. There, it is closely allied with Iran in propping up the murderous Assad regime in Syria. In his 20 years in power, the former KGB colonel, who worked closely with East Germany’s notorious Stasi secret police, has never hidden his ambition to re-establish the global influence of the Soviet Union.Mr Putin’s feigned surprise over the Duma’s move strained credulity. That is what dictators do. Two years ago in China, Mr Putin’s ally, Xi Jinping, was given his job for life. Donald Trump persists in calling Mr Putin his “friend”. Mr Putin’s nefarious role in the oil crisis and other activities, including attempts to subvert US and other Western political processes, should convince the US President otherwise. On Mr Putin’s watch, Russia has plunged from 82nd to 137th on Transparency International’s corrupt nations index. Sixteen more years of Mr Putin would prolong the 21st-century cold war, with the West pursuing a containment strategy like that which eventually prevailed against Soviet communism 30 years ago.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Putin gears up for a long haul	The Australian	Vladimir Putin’s term as Russian president is due to expire in 2024. Given his record, it comes as no surprise that he is not going to let the small matter of Russia’s constitution, and its bar on him serving another term, stand in the way of him continuing to rule. Mr Putin has served as president or prime minister for 20 years. Only Joseph Stalin ruled the former Soviet Union for longer, from the mid-1920s to 1953.
Mr Putin, 67, wants more. And the sweeping constitutional changes he intends to put to a referendum are designed to facilitate it. They will not formally make him president for life, as China’s Xi Jinping has ensured for himself in China. But by substantially reducing the powers of the president who will come after him and making parliament responsible for appointing the prime minister and cabinet, Mr Putin has opened the way to continue pulling the strings. He could be prime minister again. Or he could emulate Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stepped down after 28 years as Kazakhstan’s president but remains head of the “guiding” national security council.
Mr Putin’s closest aide, prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, has quit to become deputy head of Russia’s national security council, presided over by Mr Putin, which is to gain enhanced powers. It could be the vehicle for their continued rule. Titles mean little to dictators. Deng Xiaoping, after leaving office in 1989, continued exercising power as “Paramount Leader” when the highest office he formally held was president of China’s Bridge Association.Mr Putin is like a modern tsar; his lust for power is undiminished and there is no sign of him preparing to retire to his dacha. Those who hope the shift to stronger parliamentary power is a step away from autocracy are likely to be disappointed.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Cowboy egos threatening stability, good governance	The Australian	Voters regard destructive political squabbling with disdain
After the years of chaos that followed Labor’s rolling of Kevin Rudd in his first term as prime minister in 2010, voters across the political spectrum hoped that the current parliament would at least provide stability. Both sides, it was reasonable to assume when Scott Morrison won in May last year, had learned from the chaos: that is, infighting and leadership instability are no foundation for good governance. Nine months on, the Morrison government is being undermined from within, by the dissent and leadership chaos wracking its junior Coalition partner. Far from centring on conflicting policy principles, the aggro tearing the Nationals apart is primarily about personal animosities, ambition and greed. This makes it all the more shameful, especially when the party’s rural and regional base has been struggling with the ravages of long-term drought followed by bushfires and now the coronavirus impact on exports.
It is reasonable to question what Nationals MPs agitating against Michael McCormack want — aside from personal advancement. ­ The main policy concern, especially among Queensland members — support for a new coal-fired power station — has been met, for now, with the Morrison government funding a $4m feasibility study for Shine Energy’s proposed project in Collinsville, about halfway between Townsville and Mackay. Last week’s leadership challenge by former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has left federal cabinet without its strongest advocate for Queensland, northern Australia and so-called “high-efficiency, low-emissions’’ (HELE) coal-fired power. Former resources minister Matt Canavan stood aside when he backed Mr Joyce. Senator Canavan also cited his failure to declare his link to the North Queensland Cowboys at the time they gained a loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.
The Nationals’ problems deepened on Monday when Mr McCormack, and to a lesser extent Mr Morrison, were embarrassed on the floor of the House of Representatives when the Coalition’s nomination for deputy speaker, Victorian Nationals MP Damian Drum, was defeated 75 votes to 67 by Queensland Nationals MP Llew O’Brien, who was backed by Labor and rogue Nationals MPs. Mr O’Brien resigned from the Nationals but will still sit in the Coalition partyroom. Mr O’Brien’s fellow Queenslander, Ken O’Dowd, rubbed salt into Mr McCormack’s wounds, describing the vote as a “warning shot” for the leader.
Such goading of more formidable past Nationals leaders such as Doug Anthony, Tim Fischer and John Anderson would’ve been unthinkable. For decades, the party was a bulwark of stability. Disagreements were decided in the privacy of the partyroom. Mr McCormack knows he is on notice and needs to cut through. He has pulled out of a two-day road safety summit in Stockholm next week to deal with the splits. He must quickly lift his advocacy in traditional party strongholds, where its base is under threat from interlopers such as Pauline Hanson’s One Nation, Katter’s Australian Party and the Fishers and Shooters.
In Queensland, the Nationals’ disunity could cost the LNP the chance to defeat the Palaszczuk government in October. The Nationals must do more on drought and bushfire recovery, promoting regional investment, economic development and water management. During last year’s campaign, Mr McCormack promised a National Water Grid Authority to plan and manage water infrastructure, security and policy across the nation. The $100m organisation, established on October 1, needs to make an impact, sooner rather than later.
There is even a possibility of rebel Nationals joining Labor, the Greens, loathed in the bush, and crossbenchers to block legislation. Such an escalation of mistrust would seriously damage the government. In an attempt to arrest the slide, Mr Morrison is opting for restrained reconciliation. Josh Frydenberg joked on Tuesday that the Coalition’s broad church might need a couple more pews. But if those driving the internecine war insist on putting ego before good governance and are not reined in, they will sorely test voters’ tolerance.As Simon Benson writes on Wednesday, time is on Mr Morrison’s side. But the Byzantine turf war is robbing him of clear air. Undermining stability for personal gain is the height of political folly and contrary to the national interest.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime

He must strengthen his party’s performance in traditional strongholds, where its base is under threat from interlopers such as Pauline Hanson’s One Nation, Katter’s Australian Party and the Fishers and Shooters. In Queensland, the Nationals’ disunity could cost the LNP the chance to defeat the Palaszczuk government in October.
The Nationals must do more on drought and bushfire recovery, promoting regional investment, economic development and water management. During last year’s campaign, Mr McCormack promised a National Water Grid Authority to plan and manage water infrastructure, security and policy across the nation. The $100m organisation, established on October 1, needs to make an impact, sooner rather than later.There is even a possibility of rebel Nationals joining Labor, the Greens, loathed in the bush, and crossbenchers to block legislation. Such an escalation of mistrust would seriously damage the government. In an attempt to arrest the slide, Mr Morrison is opting for restrained reconciliation. Josh Frydenberg joked on Tuesday that the Coalition’s broad church might need a couple more pews. But if those driving the internecine war insist on putting ego before good governance and are not reined in, they will sorely test voters’ tolerance. As Simon Benson writes on Wednesday, time is on Mr Morrison’s side. But the Byzantine turf war is robbing him of clear air. Undermining stability for personal gain is the height of political folly and contrary to the national interest.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Aged-care lobby to be front and centre of next election	The Australian	Voters want better services for the elderly, but are not keen to pay
The aged-care crunch has been coming for decades. As Simon Benson reports on Monday, a coalition of 1000 aged-care organisations — operated by churches, charities and private providers — is set to unleash a campaign across 30 federal electorates, demanding that the government spend an extra $20bn a year to bring the sector into line with world standards. The target electorates include the 15 most marginal in Australia and 15 with the highest proportion of voters over 55. The timing is masterful, with an election to be held early next year, at the latest. More immediately, the campaign coincides with the final report of the royal commission into the aged-care sector, due to be handed to the Morrison government late next week. It is likely to be highly critical of long-term funding shortfalls and other serious problems that have denied older Australians the quality of care they deserve. The commission’s interim report in October 2019 highlighted incidences of staff shortages, neglect and unconscionable examples of abuse at aged-care homes.
The lobby group, calling itself the Australian Aged Care Collaboration, is spearheaded by the main church-backed providers — Catholic Health Care, Anglicare, Baptist Health Care, UnitingCare Australia — as well as not-for-profit, charity and private operators. Some of its players will be adroit campaigners on the ground, eager to follow in the footsteps of the push by the Catholic and independent school sectors against the Turnbull government in 2018. This alliance, however, will be targeting all parties. One electorate in the firing line is Flinders, held by Health Minister Greg Hunt. Mr Hunt holds it by 2.8 per cent and more than half its voters are aged 55 or over.
The group is highlighting clear shortfalls in the system. In 2016-17, for example, 16,000 people died while awaiting government-subsidised support in their own homes. About 100,000 people are currently waiting for home support, with those in need of the highest level packages typically waiting at least 12 months. A further 88,000 places will be needed in communal residential aged care over the next decade, at a cost of $55bn. According to the alliance, Australia devotes 1.2 per cent of GDP to aged care, compared with the OECD average of 2.5 per cent of GDP.
The lessons that emerge from the alliance’s manifesto, It’s Time to Care About Aged Care,reinforce the warnings Treasury has issued in its Intergenerational Reports since 2002. That year, when the Howard government released the first report, it warned that the nation needed to prepare for an “aged care resourcing crisis’’. In 2010, the Gillard government’s Intergenerational Report noted that the number of Australians aged 65 to 84 would more than double over the next 40 years, and the number aged 85 years and over would quadruple. As the population aged, the proportion of working people to support them was set to fall sharply, from five working people per aged person in 2010 to about 2.7 working people for every older Australian by 2050. Market forces, that report predicted, would eventually boost wages for aged-care workers as demand for their services increased. Recruitment of suitable staff from overseas could be necessary if the needs of older Australians were to be met, Treasury noted 11 years ago. An updated intergenerational report will be released in the middle of this year.
Home-care packages, which allow older people to stay in their homes and communities, are increasingly popular. The government has funded an extra 10,000 packages a year over the past three years. The lobby group’s effort will ensure the issue is front and centre in the May budget. While the treatment of older, vulnerable people is a hallmark of a civilised society, the demand for a doubling of taxpayer spending and the royal commission findings to date underline several points.
First, as Australia emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic facing net debt of $1.4 trillion by 2023-24, spending in other spheres, including welfare, must be contained if the aged-care sector is to receive a significant increase to meet the needs of the ageing population. Second, the looming cost of aged care is a prime reason to prioritise growth and productivity to boost government revenue. Third, with about 78,000 extra staff needed now, as the commission estimates, immigration could have a role to play. And fourth, extra money will not solve all problems. Too many older Australians have suffered unkindness and incompetence from those supposed to be caring for them. Those lobbying for more money need to look hard at themselves. Nor can the issue of retirees with the means to pay for more of their own care be ignored. In December, Adam Creighton opened a Pandora’s box when he raised the issue of tighter means tests and argued that “the massive increase in public spending on the horizon is not inevitable if we can shift more of the cost on to the recipients of the services’’. In its interim report, the royal commission said the system was “a shocking tale of neglect … that diminishes Australia as a nation”. Cabinet’s expenditure review committee met last week to discuss the issue. This will be a “barbecue stopper’’ political issue in the months ahead.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Democrats’ own goal on Trump	The Australian	Voters will decide on the Ukraine controversy in November
As political miscalculations go, the US Democrats have surpassed themselves in their impeachment pursuit of Donald Trump. The rejection by even key moderate Republican senators of the Democrats’ attempts to introduce new witnesses — notably former national security adviser John Bolton — at Mr Trump’s Senate “trial” leaves little doubt about the extent to which House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues overreached. The result is that with Republicans firmly in control of the Senate — and no prospect of the two-thirds super majority required for conviction under Article 1 of the constitution — Mr Trump appears set for the swift acquittal he was seeking, possibly by Thursday (AEDT). This is no surprise. Mr Trump’s controversial phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may have been “reckless and dumb”. But it was never the “high crime or misdemeanour” required for impeachment and the short-circuiting of the term of a democratically elected president.
Veteran Republican senator Lamar Alexander, regarded by Democrats as one of their best hopes to cross the floor, dealt a death blow to their expectations when he said that while Democrats had demonstrated the President’s actions were “inappropriate”, they had not proved them impeachable offences. “The question then is not whether the President did it, but whether the Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did,” he said. Voters should make the decision on November 3. Given Mr Bolton’s pivotal role as former national security adviser, he could still pose a danger to Mr Trump. Whatever emerges, however, will be for voters to judge.
Ms Pelosi and her colleagues ignored such counsel before they started the ill-judged impeachment attempt. Impeachment in some form, however dubious, was on the cards from the day Mr Trump entered the White House in 2017 and a Washington newspaper headline declared: “The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.” Whether the Democrats regret their ill-fated gambit is unclear. But the process has had a powerful impact on the Republican Party. It has closed ranks behind the President in a way likely to help him in November. Scott Reed, who oversees political activity for the powerful US Chamber of Commerce, noted that the impeachment process has “has welded Mr Trump and his congressional party together … Trump’s success at governing has driven the Republican Party to him … wage growth is the real magic”. The process does not appear to have dented the President’s standing among his grassroots supporters.While Democrats remain in disarray over a candidate to take on Mr Trump, Republicans are more united than they were four years ago. Most polls show Mr Trump largely where he was before impeachment, in the mid to high 40s, and a reasonable chance to beat Democrat frontrunner Joe Biden.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Shorten fires up energy debate	The Australian	Voters will pull the plug on Labor if it pushes up power bills
Bill Shorten’s declaration of support for gas and industry can be read as an ominous sign of leadership instability within the ALP and a welcome call to arms on the need to foster a durable energy market for the nation’s future prosperity. There are now clear divisions within Labor over moves to backtrack from its election campaign support for new gas infrastructure. Opposition resources spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon was slapped down by Anthony Albanese and energy spokesman Mark Butler after supporting calls by the federal government’s National COVID-19 Commission advisory group for new gas infrastructure.
By rejecting gas, the Opposition Leader and Mr Butler are signalling they intend to go all in on renewables in the hope that new technologies such as hydrogen and storage will deliver on their promise before coal, which supplies 70 per cent of power, exits the system. In doing so, they risk forgetting a key lesson from last year’s federal election on the shallow depth of voter support for renewables when it comes to cost. The pandemic has clouded an already confused picture. But there have been sufficient warnings in recent days for government not to lose sight of the challenge in finding a secure and affordable replacement for the existing fleet of coal-fired power stations, which increasingly are in financial peril.
A report on Monday by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission warns of medium-term supply shortfalls of gas in southern states without new developments to compensate for declining production in Victoria’s Gippsland Basin. ACCC chairman Rod Sims criticised the gas sector for selling Australian gas cheaper to overseas customers than domestic consumers, saying it “will have an inevitable impact on Australia’s industrial sector during what is already a difficult economic period”. To correct the market, the ACCC is calling for more investment in north-south pipelines and the development of new import terminals to promote competition.
While some people celebrated confirmation from the Australian Energy Regulator last month that electricity generated from coal had fallen to its lowest level since the start of the National Electricity Market, it is not all good news. Record high levels of wind and solar generation displaced coal from the market, playing financial havoc with the sector that still represents the backbone of domestic electricity supply.
Shareholder activists are calling on AGL to bring forward the closure of its remaining coal-fired power plants by at least 12 years in the name of tackling climate change. Big investments are needed to replace ageing coal generators. In response to questions from a Senate committee, National COVID-19 Commission chairman Nev Power warned that investment in gas should not be allowed to drop off the agenda. Mr Power said the commission had looked at the advantages of using gas as a firming fuel to assist the introduction of renewables. He said Australia had a very large pipeline for investment in renewables but a very small pipeline for investment in storage and firming because those technologies were not as well advanced.
Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor is correct to say that Australia’s competitive advantage has always been based on cheap energy, and that affordable gas will be good for jobs and economic growth. It is equally true that gas has an important role to play in providing grid reliability and in reducing emissions alongside renewables, not instead of them. This fact appears to have been embraced by Mr Shorten and his ALP colleagues, including Mr Fitzgibbon and Kim Carr. Mr Albanese and Mr Butler, however, appear to have lost their stated appetite for bipartisanship on the renewables transition, even in the time of COVID. They risk reminding voters that Labor is not sure if it is for the workers or the greens, reanimating the ambitions of a former leader and ultimately slowing the recovery from the pandemic and putting the financial security of the nation’s industry at risk.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Advice on COVID-19 must be prompt, calm and clear	The Australian	Vulnerable people, especially the elderly, need extra help
After millions of words and hours of footage, mixed and inconsistent messaging about the coronavirus across different states has left the public confused and therefore more vulnerable to its effects. While attention has switched to the economic effects of the disease, basic public health issues remain in need of serious, immediate attention. As reported on Tuesday, a special national hotline has been overwhelmed by callers seeking advice, and confusion within the health system has seen patients given conflicting information. People seeking tests have struggled to find out what symptoms justified immediate action.
The closure on Monday morning of two Sydney schools, Willoughby Girls High and St Patrick’s Marist College Dundas, after three students tested positive to the virus, and the diagnosis of fresh cases in Victoria and Western Australia, were a sign of what to expect in coming days and weeks. Melbourne’s Carey Grammar School has shut its doors for 24 hours. School shutdowns, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said, are likely to become “the new normal”. Australia’s first coronavirus case was confirmed on January 25. By Wednesday last week, the total had risen to 46. By Monday, it was 94, out of 110,000 reported cases worldwide. What started as China’s problem, then rapidly spread in South Korea, Iran and Italy, is now Australia’s problem. Experts such as Professor Raina MacIntyre, head of the University of NSW’s school of public health and community medicine, warn that given our relatively older population, the death rate in Australia could be proportionately higher than the 2.3 per cent rate of confirmed cases seen in China. With a vaccine possibly a year away, optimum treatment, especially of those in their 70s and older, will be vital. The aged-care sector, already under pressure, will be tested.
Governments and health authorities have sought to reassure the public that the nation’s health system is among the best-placed in the world to handle an epidemic. Most, but not all, of those who have caught or will catch the virus will experience mild flu-like symptoms. Panic buying and other overreactions, however, are signs of unease in the community. Better information is needed to reassure those who are uncertain about what they are facing and those worried about what they should do — if anything. Is it safe, for example, to leave loved ones in nursing homes or would it be better, where possible, for them to stay with family until the crisis passes? How long might that be? Is it sensible to visit people in nursing homes? And who will step up to cover for staff who refuse to attend work at aged-care facilities where residents are diagnosed with the virus?
The Australian Medical Association advises it is important not to “clog up’’ the system with unnecessary testing. But who should be tested, where and when? As reporter Lachlan Moffet Gray found when he experienced flu-like symptoms in Sydney on Monday, the system is woefully inadequate. Patients face long telephone delays and, despite being potentially contagious, are shunted from one pathology clinic to another, many of which close at 3pm. Moffet Gray spent hours traipsing around the city, from one medical facility to another and finally to hospital, mainly on public transport. Patients may be told they need to wait four days to be tested. Given the spread of the disease internationally, it would make sense for inbound travellers, but that does not appear to be on the radar. The downside of not testing inbound travellers was evident in Western Australia on Sunday when a woman tested positive after attending an orchestral concert on Saturday night. She had recently returned home from Cuba and London. The WA Health Department is now working to track down those who may have sat near her at the concert. As a result of the incident, West Australians who arrive home from overseas showing symptoms will be asked to self-isolate until their test results are known.
In Tasmania, Premier Peter Gutwein is considering imposing fines of up to $8500 for people ignoring directions to self-quarantine. Self-quarantine is also causing confusion, however. Should immediate family members and housemates move out or isolate themselves as well? Should a patient diagnosed with the virus move out and, if so, where? Those practical issues could be influenced, in part, by the Morrison government’s economic stimulus package. The needs of casual workers, for example, who do not have sick leave but are compelled to stay away from work, will be addressed at a meeting on Tuesday between business, unions and government. It is also vital that the public is told, clearly and often, in English and other languages, about how best to prevent contracting the virus and what to do if they show symptoms. People want to know whether it is safe to attend large gatherings or to travel in crowded trains and buses. What are the risks of flying domestically or overseas, even to areas not regarded as hotspots? In addition to widespread advertisements, such information needs to be distributed via schools, hospitals, nursing homes, doctors’ surgeries and indigenous health and community centres. The information provided on various states’ Health Department websites is good. But many nursing home residents, poorer people and those in remote areas do not access the internet. Others are uncertain about where to search and what to believe.
State governments and chief medical officers are holding almost daily press conferences. In the interests of uniformity and consistency, Health Minister Greg Hunt and the federal government’s Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy, need to draw state and territory ministers and chief medical officers together regularly to ensure the messages being relayed are uniform and clear. Far greater information needs to be provided as soon as possible.
On Sunday, AMA president Tony Bartone underlined the need for consistency. The federal government and the states needed to be “singing from the same song sheet’’ by co-ordinating their messages, he said. “Right from the beginning, we have had the states going in different directions … whether it was ­attending schools or the advice on handshakes. People need calm, consistent messaging from governments. Right now, frontline doctors feel utterly exposed.” Many doctors had found it difficult to obtain accurate clinical guidance or access to personal protection equipment, he said. GPs are on the frontlines of fighting the epidemic, as are hospital casualty departments. But confusion is also rife in that sector, unfortunately. On Friday, South Australian AMA branch president Chris Moy told the ABC that initial advice provided in some states had not made it clear that individuals who suspected they had the virus should ring from home before heading to hospital. He said posters in Victorian and South Australian hospitals had originally recommended patients present in person. But he intervened to have that changed in South Australia.
The AMA also complained last week about a shortage of gloves and masks. More are on the way, but the delays are not good enough. The public also has a right to know that health experts and mask makers warn that only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask, certified by an independent agency, is effective. In advice posted by The Wall Street Journal, and available on our website, experts advise that paper or polyurethane foam masks do not filter out smaller particles responsible for transmitting infectious agents. They may have a role, however, in helping prevent sick people from transmitting the virus to others. Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Paul Kelly, advises that it is unnecessary for people in the commun­ity to wear masks.The Morrison government’s stimulus package will tackle the economic fallout of the emergency. But the government must prioritise the needs of those most at risk of contracting the virus, especially the elderly, and those battling it in the health system. As COVID-19 spreads, ensuring sufficient tests, laboratory facilities and personnel are available will be front and centre. Making good use of private pathology services makes eminent sense. Treating and caring for those who need nursing back to health and home care, including shopping and collecting medicines for those in self-isolation, could also become important. Authorities need to be flexible and practical in supporting and protecting health workers and patients. A nationally co-ordinated information push, to help overcome anxieties and uncertainties, must also be a priority.	10	parents parenting; families family; family life
Housing-led recovery flows into business confidence	The Australian	Wages decision should take account of the uncertain outlook
Despite the strong economic bounce back from the depths of the pandemic-inspired recession, mixed signals remain on what may happen in coming months. Critical will be the ability of businesses to keep rebounding as government assistance programs are withdrawn. The December quarter national accounts figures released on Thursday underscore the dramatic extent to which consumption, notably the property boom, has underpinned the recovery to date.
The big unknown is to what extent the withdrawal of JobKeeper at the end of this month will sap energy from the recovery clearly under way. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show how much momentum stimulus measures have put into the economic recovery. In headline terms, household wealth increased $501.5bn (4.3 per cent) to a record $12,033.5bn in the December quarter, the highest quarterly growth rate since the December quarter 2009. Total household wealth and wealth per capita, at $467,709, were at record levels.
The ABS says the December quarter growth in household wealth was driven by rising residential property prices, reflecting record low interest rates, support through government programs such as the First Home Owner Grant and HomeBuilder schemes, and pent-up demand from buyers. Through the year, household wealth grew 7 per cent, slightly below the long-term average of 7.3 per cent. However, demand for credit eased to $63.3bn in the December period, following the previous quarter’s record of $154.7bn.
Feelings of household wealth have fed into business confidence in the March period, with businesses reporting improved financial circumstances and reduced use of government support measures. The latest Business Conditions and Sentiments survey showed 46 per cent of businesses expected it to be easy or very easy to meet financial commitments during the next three months, compared with 23 per cent in August last year. The proportion of businesses reporting decreased revenue halved in March compared with August last year, falling from 41 per cent to 22 per cent. The proportion of businesses using support measures dropped to less than one-third from a peak of 73 per cent in May last year.
All in all, it is a strong position to be in as the economy and business approach the fiscal cliff of the withdrawal of JobKeeper payments on March 28. This is expected to have a measurable impact on small business and the rebounding jobs market. Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy told Senate estimates on Wednesday that Treasury expected the end of JobKeeper to directly cause some businesses to close and 100,000 to 150,000 jobs to be lost, but there was a wide band of uncertainty around this estimate. Dr Kennedy said growth would moderate as Australia moved past the initial phase of the recovery from COVID-19.
Balancing economic growth and continued jobs growth against the benefits of getting more money circulating in the economy is at the heart of the looming decision on increasing the minimum wage. The ACTU has put in a bid on Friday for the minimum wage to be increased by $26.38 a week, a rise of 3.5 cent. The Australian Industry Group will argue that the Fair Work Commission needs to take a particularly cautious approach given the economic and business risks associated with the end of JobKeeper. The issue will be decided in late June, with the new rate to apply from July 1. Last year, at the height of the pandemic lockdown, the FWC approved an increase 1.75 per cent but delayed the additional payment for at least three months for 75 per cent of recipients.
The ACTU says the minimum wage review is a critical opportunity to generate wage growth and keep the economic recovery going. It says the Reserve Bank has repeatedly made clear that wage growth is too low and this is a brake on economic growth and the recovery from the pandemic has so far increased profits but not wages, and labour’s share of GDP has fallen to historic lows. But employers argue the decision should follow the cautious approach of last year.
In making a decision, the FWC must consider the benefits of recent tax cuts for low-income workers and the pending increase in superannuation. It also should be mindful of warnings from the Reserve Bank that wages growth more generally is not expected to pick up until unemployment falls below 5 per cent. The recovery is under way but tied disproportionately to booming house prices. The challenge is to build strength in the business sector to create new jobs and safeguard the gains that have been made rather than pay more to those who already have a job.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Living in a less than perfect world	The Australian	Warning of possible danger is the responsible thing for adults to do In a world where bad things happen, it is not unreasonable to alert young people to potential danger. This does not make bad things acceptable or mean that if the worst does happen it is the fault of those left traumatised by events. One lesson of life is that misadventure can leave lasting scars. Sometimes it is worth it. In extreme or criminal cases, clearly it is not. The whirlwind that has engulfed the nation’s Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Campbell, because of his advice to first-year cadets on personal behaviour has touched a raw nerve. General Campbell told young men and women they should exercise caution and avoid becoming prey to sexual predators by being out late, alone, drunk and attractive. Many parents, especially of teenage girls and women in their early 20s, have given precisely the same advice.
The response from many has been that young people have the right to be out drunk alone after midnight looking good because it is the perpetrator who is responsible for bad outcomes, not the individual. Of course it is the perpetrator who is at fault and there is nothing that can justifiably invite criminal assault. Clearly, General Campbell’s intention was not to let offenders off the hook but this is how his words have been interpreted by many in today’s rights-based culture. Acting Defence Minister Marise Payne said the most important message was to would-be sexual predators — don’t. Given the history of abuse within the Australian Defence Force, this is advice that constantly must be delivered loud and clear. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said men needed to change their behaviour, not women. Australian of the Year Grace Tame, a child sex abuse survivor, said the idea this was something a victim had to foresee and stop themselves, as if they were to blame, was really unhelpful. For sure, it is disappointing that this is even a discussion that still must be had. In a perfect world, everybody is free to enjoy unrestricted freedom of expression and of course young women are legitimately entitled to feel safe in public whatever they choose to wear or do. It is also true that personal responsibility is increasingly unfashionable in a world defined by collective rights. It is the condition of youth to rebel against sage advice. As the old Beastie Boys hit song says, “You gotta fight for your right to party”. Equally, it is the responsibility of parents and adults to make sure warnings of possible danger are given and well heard. If the Chief of the Defence Force cannot speak up for the virtues of personal discipline, what hope is there?	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks

Investment the key to recovery	The Australian	We can’t go back to politics or business as usual post-crisis
Economists from the club of rich nations expect Australia to be best of breed in weathering the pandemic storm and a star in recovery next year. Certainly, the signs are encouraging from fresh surveys of business and consumer confidence. Our official forecasters may be tossing out worst-case scenarios for a contraction in national output and joblessness yet they are worried about tapering-off points for income support in September. In its latest outlook, the OECD warns that a second wave of COVID-19 infections would fillet another $25bn from the economy and flatten the anticipated revival next year. That would lead to “substantial and rising” bankruptcies and job losses in an economy $60bn smaller than would otherwise be the case.
The Morrison government is trying to engineer a smooth transition for companies and workers. The economy will be different post-coronavirus, so the harder it is for capital and labour to shift out of declining industries and into expanding ones, the more likely our performance will be sub-par — as it was leading into the crisis. Productivity was on the slide, per capita income was falling and consumers had tightened their spending. The most worrying part of our game was that business investment had slumped and our capital base had become shallow. The rate at which Australians were starting businesses, too, had fallen to a generational low. Where once there’d been a palpable dynamism in companies and among policymakers, a muddling-through complacency had descended.
Getting the economic party started, so to speak, will need more than the emergency stimulus approach, as helpful as that has been for those on financial life support. The government was right to reject a bailout for Virgin Australia. The HomeBuilder package for the construction sector may fit a “whatever it takes” political mindset right now but does not qualify as best-practice policy. At least the extension of the instant asset write-off has a better pedigree, given it has had several iterations and is delivered through existing channels. But will it get companies and sole traders to shell out for a lot more kit in the bleak midwinter of recession? Probably not. Had Josh Frydenberg delivered the budget last month, pre-pandemic signals were it would have contained an investment allowance. We would welcome one in the coming economic statement or the October budget at the latest.
Yet this, too, is ad hocery. The next policy phase requires bolder moves for the medium term. National cabinet must try to slash the red and green tape around major projects, including for new infrastructure. The states need some giddy-up to ditch their job-killing taxes and regulations. The government has facilitated a parley between unions and business to find common ground in five key areas. With a huge pool of unemployed likely once the welfare music stops, we’ll need workplace flexibility, less complex yet timely wage deals, and fewer awards. The magic of productivity growth comes out of the conditions prevailing at the enterprise level. Managers and workers are the key to higher living standards, not judges, with respect, your honours. If the Treasurer is serious about a business-led recovery, as he avows, he’ll have to improve on the incentives for capital expansion and remove the disincentives. That requires a lower company tax rate, which is vital for attracting investment and necessary if our firms are to compete in a more rough-and-tumble post-corona league. Mr Frydenberg must use the crisis of a capital strike to take the shackles off business. As well, it’s a big work book on the supply side, one that Labor must also embrace if it wants to reclaim its once-cherished credentials as an outfit that seeks to build and create, not only spend and redistribute. Can the political class put down its weapons for the greater good, to get the nation off its knees? It’s almost a mantra: we can’t go back to politics or business as usual.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Sussexes tread centuries-old path	The Australian	We do not need a head of state born into the job in a nation far away If they could bear to watch it, constitutional monarchists cringed at the tittle-tattle that emerged from Oprah Winfrey’s interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex (a county where she has spent a total of six hours of her life, reportedly). No wonder Australians for Constitutional Monarchy national convener David Flint argued the ­interview had “no relevance” to changing this nation’s Constitution. Others who recognise the British monarchy is irrelevant to Australia rolled their eyes and thought “viva la republic”. A lot of serious work will be needed before that important day arrives, however. This would be a sensible time to look ahead as the 68-year reign of Queen Elizabeth, 94, approaches its end, and Prince Philip, 99, becomes increasingly frail.
The Elizabethan age has served Britain, and the Commonwealth, arguably, well. What happens next in Australia, however, should be up to us. It must not depend on how well, or badly, Prince Charles steps into his mother’s shoes or whether William and Catherine recapture the homespun appeal of his great grandparents, George VI and the Queen Mother. Australia’s future is about us. And reforming the Constitution to ensure we have our own head of state will be time-consuming and complex, as the 1999 referendum showed.
It would be a bad mistake to believe the Sussexes’ self-serving victimhood rhetoric, and Harry’s idiocy a week earlier as he was filmed driving around Los Angeles taking tea on an open-top bus, will be a serious blow to the British monarchy. For 12 centuries, it has survived on bloodbaths, beheadings, insanity, treachery, excommunications and even an earlier American divorcee, Wallis Simpson. Shakespeare dramatised family rivalries on the Tudor age’s favourite platform, the stage. “Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak when power to flattery bows? To plainness honour’s bound when majesty falls to folly,” the Earl of Kent told his master, King Lear. Banal it may be, but claims about who cried — Kate or Meghan — over bridesmaids’ dresses is the stuff of Renaissance blockbusters. These would have also included a bloodied dagger or several, not just a chat, for which Winfrey and her team pocketed $7m. The question of which royal wondered how brown baby Archie would be is a handy tease — it will keep the speculation going for ages. The interview was short on facts, long on fiction. For those who care, Archie is not entitled to be a prince under protocol; the supposed garden “wedding’’, three days before the real wedding, was not legally binding. In a play, Meghan and Harry would be comic relief characters. Espousing every woke cause, with claims to the moral high ground on green issues, they are intent on safeguarding their luxurious lifestyle, their $19m home and frequent, carbon-producing air travel. The British press, they whinge, made life “unbearable’’. But they have taken the role of “royal media tarts’’ to another dimension. As author Andrew Morton says, there is also a striking similarity between Ms Markle’s tearful tale of woe, suicidal tendencies and complaint about being a “prisoner in the palace” to the complaints of Diana, the Princess of Wales, who died in 1997. None of it is more damaging, however, than Prince Andrew’s alleged taste for underage girls, provided by the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Or more dismissive of national sovereignty, including ours, than Prince Charles’ ludicrous embrace of the World Economic Forum’s “Great Reset’’. The interview was a reminder of how far removed the monarchy is from Australia. It was ever thus; but the future is up to us.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Spy boss comes out of shadows	The Australian	We face unrivalled threats from extremists and foreign powers
Right now, terrorists are plotting to harm us. That’s the grim, realistic and candid message from ASIO director-general Mike Burgess in his annual security assessment. He said the threat of terrorism at home was “probable” and would remain unacceptably high for the foreseeable future. According to Mr Burgess, the number of terrorism leads ASIO is investigating has doubled since this time last year. “The character of terrorism will continue to evolve and we believe that it will take on a more dispersed and diversified face,” he said on Monday. Mr Burgess did not flinch in calling out violent Islamic extremism as the No 1 concern, but he also pointed out a disturbing rise in new players in the arena from the extreme right wing who are organised in small cells, security conscious and in contact with radicalised groups overseas. Given the recent experience in Britain, where extremists have been released from prison, only to commit violent acts, we must not be complacent about monitoring them or the tools that so easily promulgate hate and violence.
Mr Burgess highlighted the rising risks from espionage and foreign interference, the “sleepers” in our midst. It was a theme former ASIO chief Duncan Lewis developed in a speech last September, just before he retired. The threat from espionage — quiet, insidious and having a long tail, often decades — was “far and away the most serious issue going forward”, he said. ASIO’s assessment was that the current scale and scope of foreign intelligence activity against Australian interests was “unprecedented” and had the capacity to be an “existential threat” to democracies. Mr Burgess said more foreign agents were operating on our soil than at the height of the Cold War.
Several foreign governments are targeting us. Although not named by the domestic security agency chief, we can envisage the list of authoritarian regimes that are trying to disrupt our information infrastructure, steal our secrets and intellectual property, control our democratic processes and political parties, and infiltrate our key institutions, especially academia. ASIO has observed visiting scientists and academics ingratiating themselves into university life here with the aim of conducting clandestine intelligence collection. “This strikes at the very heart of our notions of free and fair academic exchange,” Mr Burgess noted. The KGB was once the bogey, but the rise of the People’s Republic of China has supplanted it. No other nation comes close to its espionage footprint. ASIO’s threat stocktake, Greg Sheridan argued on Tuesday, showed “those folks who say the Chinese government is being demonised in Australian security discussions are simply refusing to face reality”.
With today’s encryption technology, it’s more difficult than ever to curtail the activities of terrorists and spies. In December last year, Scott Morrison announced a new specialist unit, the Counter Foreign Interference Taskforce, to identify, disrupt and prosecute such activity. Successive governments have been scaling up the defence effort, through spending and legislation. In 2018, with Labor’s support, the Coalition introduced a package of national security laws to curb foreign interference, earning the ire of our major trading partner. It has been chilly in Beijing ever since for our diplomats and businesses. Mr Burgess, however, said the mere passage of new laws made foreign spies change their game, “driving more cost into their risk calculus”. These laws are saving lives.On Tuesday, the Prime Minister vowed to tackle “foreign interference in all its forms wherever it comes from, and each and every day we ensure that our agencies are well resourced to counteract that threat”. Mr Burgess declared those who wanted to interfere in our society would be hunted down and exposed; those trying to harm Australians would be thwarted and prosecuted. It will require resilience and vigilance from security agencies, our leaders and the community at large. We welcome the ASIO chief’s frankness. He has seized the moment, coming out of the shadows, so to speak, to give Australians a timely wake-up call.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Do no lasting harm must be stimulus first principle	The Australian	We first need to ride out the crisis, then emerge stronger
Four years ago, then treasurer Scott Morrison argued that we had to take action to strengthen our economic resilience to deal with the shocks that would inevitably arrive. “To get debt under control by returning the budget to balance, through disciplined expenditure restraint, and a tax system that supports growth and provides sustainable revenues,” he said. It was a line he reprised in a speech on Tuesday, as the Prime Minister recounted how year by year — through spending control, and we would add fiscal drag — the Coalition has restored the budget to balance. We applaud the effort, to a point. The fiscal buffer should have been larger, debt levels and taxes a lot lower. It’s a collective failure by a short-run-focused political class over 15 years. Mr Morrison now says coronavirus, or something like it, is the disruption he was anticipating in 2016. COVID-19, you’re soaking in it Madge. What to do? First, don’t panic by shovelling precious funds out the door, willy nilly. Identify the problems you are trying to solve.
Mr Morrison and his colleagues have spent the past 11 years or so lambasting Labor’s stimulus overkill in the wake of the global financial crisis. “Go hard, go early, go households,” was the mantra for the Rudd government’s pre-Christmas 2008 $10.4bn stimulus package. The economy then bounded out of a single quarter of gross domestic product contraction. Labor quadrupled down with a $42bn splurge in February 2009, including spending on school halls, tax breaks and cash payments. It was too much juice, well after the danger had passed, with infrastructure projects meandering along for years. Like the Howard government before it, as export prices recovered Labor then built into the budget permanent social spending on temporary revenues.
When the Coalition returned to office in 2013, Tony Abbott instituted a commission of audit by Tony Shepherd to profile government spending over the medium term. The picture was not pretty. Joe Hockey’s 2014 budget tried to reboot fiscal policy — via spending cuts, tougher welfare tests, new taxes and a medical co-payment — but was rejected by surprised voters and spat out by the parliament. Restoring the budget’s “integrity”, and we use that term loosely, has been an ad hoc affair. Mr Hockey slapped a temporary levy on high-income earners; as treasurer in 2017, Mr Morrison whacked the big banks with a tax for the simple reason that “nobody likes you”. As well, despite the program of personal income tax cuts, Canberra has been filling its coffers for years through bracket creep.
We have argued consistently for a reduction in the size of Canberra’s footprint. Despite efforts to pull it back by this government, spending is rising ahead of population growth. In fact, take out the public sector more broadly — which includes spendthrift, indebted state administrations — and GDP would be going backwards. It’s true there is capital works catch-up at play, especially on long-neglected road and rail projects, but government spending on itself is rampant. State bureaucracies are bloated, and growing, particularly in health, education, welfare and disability services. Not the frontline workers, mind you, but people who “manage” them. In any economic revival project, the states must play their part. As in the US, there is talk of payroll tax relief for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as assistance for tourism and maintenance work on government buildings. Yet apart from NSW, the states are in various stages of fiscal stress, indebtedness and mendicancy.
Mr Morrison is vowing to not only deal with the challenge of weakening demand, disrupted supply chains and crunched cashflows, he wants us to “emerge stronger and more productive on the other side”. He would say that, but it won’t be easy to pursue reform when the focus is to stay above water. The Prime Minister is right to say COVID-19 is a biological contagion, not a financial one. He notes it’s a temporal not a structural problem. Yes and no. Our supply-side weaknesses, shown up by wage stagnation, ultra-low rate of business start-ups and sagging productivity growth will be a drag on a sustained recovery in living standards. We hope Josh Frydenberg reveals a bold reform program in his second budget, but realise there are bigger fish.The Prime Minister set out guiding principles for the economic rescue effort. He’s right to flag a “clear fiscal exit strategy” and says the priority is to get the health response right. As we argued on Tuesday, co-ordinating government efforts, ramping up virus testing, maintaining medical services, minimising social disruption and clear messaging to the public are required. Yet it’s important not to lose sight of the idea government can’t do everything. We’re not China, for instance, where command and control of people and systems is the standard. Government sets the rules here and its taxing and spending at the federal level is about one-quarter of GDP. Individuals and businesses make the running. The fiscal stimulus will need to hit the sweet spot between broad community buy-in — to spend, invest and keep people in work — without a debilitating, overzealous splurge that holds us back for a decade.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Vaccine diplomacy key to region	The Australian	We have a strategic interest in helping ailing neighbours Following the bushfires that ravaged southeastern Australia last year, villagers across Papua New Guinea pushed wheelbarrows to collect donations for their neighbour in need. Disaster relief diplomacy is a big thing in a region frequently beset by the devastating forces of nature. Today, PNG is being crushed by the pandemic and is in urgent need of help. There is a keen domestic and strategic interest for Australia to quickly get on top of the unfolding COVID disaster on our doorstep in PNG and the Pacific. As Southeast Asia correspondent Amanda Hodge reported on Monday, PNG’s health system is near collapse amid a rapid spread of infection that has overwhelmed Port Moresby’s general hospital and now threatens other vulnerable Pacific communities, including the Solomon Islands, West Papua and Australia’s Torres Strait Islands.
Immunologists have warned that high levels of circulating COVID-19 in the Asia-Pacific region are a recipe for generating mutant coronavirus variants. Like the UK variant, these could spread more readily and potentially undermine the effectiveness of the vaccine programs being rolled out against the known variants of the disease.
Scott Morrison will today announce a fresh package of support to PNG, including enough vaccines to protect the entire health workforce, and an accelerated rollout across the Pacific. The obvious human toll aside, vaccine diplomacy is certain to become a potent new front in a broader strategic competition in the region. At the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) on the weekend, leaders from the US, India, Japan and Australia announced plans to distribute one billion doses of vaccines to southeast Asian and Pacific nations.
Analysts believe the use of vaccine rollouts to gain a geopolitical advantage is only just warming up. China last week deployed a medical team to Port Moresby to help in its COVID-19 effort amid reports that more than 60 staff had tested positive for COVID-19 at the city’s main hospital, and that new patients were being turned away and told to self-isolate. COVID-19 case numbers in PNG, which has the world’s sixth-lowest testing rate per capita, have doubled in a month to 1819. Health experts fear mass gatherings to mark the death of former prime minister Michael Somare will dramatically exacerbate infections. Fresh cases linked to these gatherings are expected to escalate rapidly over the coming weeks.
The worsening situation in PNG is of immediate concern to Australia because of the close links between the two countries, including the close proximity of the Western Province to Torres Strait. Six COVID-positive Australians were hospitalised in Cairns this month after arriving on a charter flight from PNG’s Ok Tedi mine. A significant number of the 51 cases detected in Queensland’s hotel quarantine system in March are Australian expatriates and fly-in-fly-out workers returning from PNG.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott says assisting PNG is both the right thing to do and an investment in the future of the region. Ms Westacott says Australia has the opportunity to act as a stabilising force in the region, while protecting our sovereignty, our values and the strength of our society. There is no doubt the COVID pandemic has made Pacific nations more vulnerable.
The IMF estimates that one-fifth of Fiji’s economic output was lost in 2020. GDP is estimated to have fallen 3 per cent in PNG, 11 per cent in Palau, and 8 per cent in Vanuatu in 2020. Australian Strategic Policy Institute executive director Peter Jennings says the federal government has been too slow to react to PNG’s unfolding disaster. He says Australian ­Defence Force medics and a hospital ship, potentially backed by private medical contractors, should be sent as soon as possible. PNG Prime Minister James Marape has asked for Australia’s help in expediting vaccines for its doctors and nurses working at the frontline of the pandemic. Australia has heeded the call.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
OPINIONMake or break for Labour	The Daily Post	We have essentially ended up as I predicted with a first-past-the-post government.
Part of my original prediction was based on the Greens not making it. But even though they have, they are irrelevant which is no bad thing.
The deal done is a kindly sop, which will result in a lot of verbal virtue signalling from the Greens, but any real progress will be Labour’s.
Part of Labour’s success is unquestionably a flight to safety. In uncertain times, safety is certainty and comfort.
The previous government was a good example of why MMP essentially doesn’t work.
We like to know where we are at.
This term is make or break for Labour simply because there are no more excuses, no one to blame for all the stuff that went wrong or didn’t happen.
My suspicion is they will make a hash of it, not because I want them to. I don’t. I want them to find talent we didn’t see in the past three years. As I said in the previous column I don’t care who runs this place as long as they run it well.
The past couple of weeks have already been a disappointment though. Yes they have been constrained by special votes and meetings with biscuits, but there are also a frighteningly long line of people, businesses, industries and sectors out there with a growing number of concerns about their futures, and Labour has been missing in action.
Decisions and plans around the border, real plans — not verbiage and hot air.
Ongoing support for sectors such as tourism which are vaccine- and therefore border-reliant, in a world where the border looks closed for next year, or at least a chunk of it.
A social housing queue that’s now at record levels having cracked 20,000.
The Auckland Port so frustrated around a lack of testing they shamed the Government and started their own programme.
The empty places at quarantine hotels as more skilled workers line up offshore desperate to get here and help.
The lack of people given exemptions to enter the country as increasing numbers of employers and firms grow desperate for labour.
Shipping that’s bypassing New Zealand and leaving shelves empty at Christmas time.
An asset-driven recovery package that’s seeing money fly out the banks’ doors at record levels and inflating house prices and making the wealthy wealthier.
Statistics that show that of the OECD countries, not one has increased their debt levels as a percentage of GDP as much as us.
So it’s not like there isn’t a lot to do. Yet for the past two weeks — nothing.
It’s confirmation of a long-held suspicion that essentially they worked out a good number of us loved being scared, liked a good dollop of welfare, and as long as we can buy a latte and go to the rugby we are basically happy.
There has never been more urgency to get on with major decision-making and yet it’s been years since we’ve seen a party less urgent in their approach.
So the fact they have the Parliament to themselves will make or break them.
If they bring the same pre-Covid ineptitude to this term as last, they are a two-term government.
If they are emboldened by their win, and throw caution to the wind and start really governing, they may surprise us all. But what we will see, is pure government, FPP government, and after the past three years I’m pretty sure that most of us will welcome the clarity.
Even if you never voted Labour you know what you are in for. Last term you didn’t have a clue.
This is bad news for Act and the Greens, and certainly bad news for New Zealand First and every other operator outside the tent trying desperately to gain traction.
In uncertain times, simplicity rules. It’s only when life is good and we are bored we start to dabble.
Niche thinking, and nuanced ideas have no real place in times of crisis.

Best response to bushfire crisis is more prevention	The Australian	We have to focus our limited resources for maximum effect
On Monday Scott Morrison dismissed any concern about the promised budget surplus as he committed $2bn towards bushfire recovery. “What matters to me is the human cost and meeting whatever cost we need to meet,” he said. That rhetoric is no surprise at a time of grief and trauma, when there are more than 200 active fires. But any effective response to the crisis will require hard-headed allocation of limited resources, robust policymaking and debate free of ideology.
It’s clear that commonwealth-state relations need to be sharpened up. This is not just a matter of avoiding petty squabbles and buck-passing but giving serious thought to clever and efficient ways for governments to work together across a bushfire-prone country to protect lives and property. Can COAG rise to the occasion? Is there a need for a new intergovernmental bushfire body? Or might crisis-driven goodwill and streamlined inter-agency protocols do the trick? The answers may become clearer as former AFP commissioner Andrew Colvin rolls out the Bushfire Recovery Agency, which is supposed to work closely with states and territories over the next two years. Victoria also has a new bushfire recovery body.
Mr Morrison has acknowledged the likely role of climate change in extending the bushfire season. Periodic drought and wind-driven fires in eucalypt forests are long-established facts of the Australian landscape but higher temperatures and reduced rainfall increase the risks. We must concentrate our efforts where we can do most to protect our citizens. After December’s climate conference in Madrid, it has only become more obvious that there is no political momentum for the deep emission cuts urged by the UN. This reality would not change were a marginal emitter such as Australia to make a dramatic, purely symbolic gesture. As it is, we are on track to meet our targets under the Paris agreement, without pointlessly sabotaging the economy that produces the wealth necessary if we are to respond to the bushfire crisis.
As has happened time and again over the years, we are paying a heavy financial and human cost attempting to fight near uncontrollable fires. We have to put more resources into bushfire prevention and adapting how we live. A helpful push in this direction may come from the insurance industry, which has logged more than 6000 claims for a total of more than $400m less than halfway into the fire season. For a country supposedly familiar with bushfire, our policy framework has been subpar. Ash Wednesday, Black Friday — the names get recycled as one horror follows another and the latest inquiry repeats familiar warnings.
Climate change is invoked by some activists as if it renders irrelevant the need to reduce fuel loads with prescribed burning; the opposite is likely to be the case. We need an honest debate revisiting the research on low-intensity cool burning, establishing the facts beyond dispute, and creating a community consensus to act upon them. In the last few days, some commentators have claimed that Victoria’s 2009 Black Saturday fires showed the impotence of prescribed burning against fires of catastrophic intensity, yet that very intensity has a lot to do with fuel load.
The royal commission following those fires said it was “concerned that the state has maintained a minimalist approach to prescribed burning despite recent official or independent reports and inquiries, all of which have recommended increasing the prescribed burning program”. As recently as February last year, Victoria’s former chief fire officer Ewan Waller warned that fuel loads had been allowed to return to dangerous levels in some parts of the state. By contrast, Western Australia’s “Red Book” manual for cool burning may be a good model for other states to examine.
The Greens acknowledge a role for prescribed burning but the concern is that misplaced environmental sentiment and a host of other factors have rendered it perfunctory and ineffective. Multiple agency approvals at state level make cool burning of national parks and forests difficult enough and there can be the added complication of federal sign-off. Our sprawling cities have pushed ever more tree-changers into fire-prone areas. Prescribed burning brings them not only the irritation of smoke and poor air quality but also the fear of a fire getting out of control.
Politicians and bureaucrats have become risk-averse, and fuel loads accumulate, especially if the window of opportunity has been narrowed by climate change.We need institutions, rules and attitudes that make bushfire prevention easier, not harder. Part of the answer has to be plugging in more local responsibility and expertise. We need better ways to assess and act on the advice of those living near national parks, farmers, the longer established residents of tree-change towns, and local bushfire volunteers. There is an opportunity to galvanise support for change. Many Australians are learning the false economy of skimping on bushfire prevention. It is a bitter lesson and must not be squandered.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
No room for complacency in Covid hotel quarantine	The Australian	We have to resist overkill in managing fresh outbreaks The COVID-19 outbreak in South Australia is obviously a concern. It looks like a failing of hotel quarantine, which is the first line of defence against a virus still causing record numbers of infections overseas. It’s troubling if one of Adelaide’s “medi-hotels” has had poor infection control. The timing is discouraging, too, because the hope has been that the country is on a path to something resembling normal life at Christmas. There is a deep need to reconnect with family and friends, for respite from anxiety and alarm.
Even so, the likelihood is that the Adelaide cluster is just one in a series of unwelcome surprises, reversals and public health puzzles ahead of us. Early results of the Pfizer vaccine are heartening but there are a host of logistical and other challenges to overcome before herd immunity. That means we have to keep thinking how best to maximise social and economic activities while minimising pandemic risk. We have to resist panicky measures and overkill, to become more effective and consistent at applying approaches that seem to work, and to reset quickly when evidence to the contrary comes in. Decisions have to be pragmatic and balanced.
Management of the Adelaide outbreak appears reassuring, with authorities stressing rapid testing, which makes successful tracing more likely. South Australia’s hotel quarantine regime was scrutinised during the national review, and the results published last month mean the broad outlines of the best model are agreed and clear. These include well-trained staff, robust systems for infection control, effective and accountable supervision, and straightforward information for domestic and overseas people coming within quarantine. One oversight was that before this outbreak, staff in Adelaide’s medi-hotels were not tested for COVID-19 unless they reported symptoms. Now there will be weekly tests, regardless of symptoms. It’s worth considering whether it makes sense to improve national oversight of hotel quarantine. Inconsistent data across jurisdictions is also a handicap we could do without.
A more immediate question is whether South Australia’s hotel quarantine has systematic shortcomings as opposed to suffering a one-off lapse. The tragic autumn outbreak at Newmarch House in western Sydney and the Ruby Princess cruise ship fiasco seemed to galvanise NSW health authorities to deploy more effectively and quickly the test-and-trace capabilities of the state. During the ensuing months, as Victoria suffered its own hotel quarantine outbreak, it became clear that NSW had an enviable agility and expertise in testing and tracing, which is the second line of defence. It needs it because Sydney has population densities and a pressure of overseas arrivals combining to make it a high risk for contagion. Paradoxically, the less risky circumstances for a small state such as South Australia, and its relatively low number of infections, may have put it at a disadvantage if indeed it lacked the sense of urgency and concern to motivate everyone from top health authorities down to medi-hotel staff to carry out their tasks with utmost seriousness and constantly refine their systems. No doubt we will learn more about this track record in the coming weeks as the causes of the Adelaide cluster are unravelled.
But even with the best quarantine systems, and skilled and vigilant staff, there will be lapses because the virus is very infectious and humans under pressure can be erratic. The daily headlines of astronomical infection counts overseas, compared with our very low levels of the illness, are a reminder that the virus will continue to be flown across our borders and delivered with its human hosts into hotel quarantine. It is the entry point and the potential escape route out into the community.
Other jurisdictions have declared South Australia a pandemic hotspot and flagged quarantine for visitors. It would be a mistake to reinstate border closures when it should not be beyond the wit of states brought together in a national cabinet to contrive cross-border arrangements, including for testing and tracing. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall has announced a range of restrictions that will curtail social and economic life. He has said he won’t rule out any necessary measures, which no doubt sends a message of resolve, but it should be widely understood by now that a deep and prolonged lockdown similar to Victoria’s is a confession of failure in prevention, and imposes terrible costs and burdens. As Damon Johnston reports on Tuesday, there is great concern about a section of schoolchildren in Melbourne whose long-delayed return to the normality of the classroom does not seem to have restored their mental wellbeing. Science does not dictate drastic interventions such as Victoria’s lockdown. The science, with all its shifting uncertainty, is a vital input to policy but it is accountable politicians who must decide how to manage the pandemic while keeping in mind the full range of fundamental social values.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Stirring the pot on nuclear energy	The Australian	We must keep our options open to use the best technologies
It is an enduring oddity of debate over how best to cut greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change that nuclear, a proven technology able to deliver large amounts of dependable emissions-free power, must barely be mentioned. Nuclear power is a major source of electricity for many developed nations but remains a taboo subject for many in Australia’s political class. The nation is in the unique position of having a high proportion of the world’s known uranium reserves, which it sells to generate electricity in other places. Yet consideration of a domestic industry is effectively banned. The stigmatisation of nuclear energy is at stark odds to its demonstrated safety record and owes much to fear and misunderstanding.
Australia has not had to consider nuclear power because of its abundant reserves of high-grade and easily accessible coal and gas. Nuclear may not be the most suitable option for Australia. The trend towards an electricity network dominated by myriad small producers means this still may be the case. As with coal, the economics of nuclear energy demand that power plants be able to dispatch close to capacity all of the time. Ultimately, however, these are issues for the market, not politicians, to decide.
Support for allowing consideration of the nuclear option appears to be growing, judging by a survey showing two-thirds of Coalition MPs backed lifting the ban on the controversial fuel source to help shift the nation to a carbon-neutral future. Nationals MPs have stirred the pot further with a proposal to allow the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to invest in nuclear power.
Attempts so far to remove impediments to nuclear being considered from the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act have proved fruitless. Scott Morrison has signalled he will not move ahead with legalising nuclear energy unless there is bipartisan support with Labor. Nonetheless, small modular nuclear reactors have been included in the government’s Technology Investment Roadmap discussion paper. The views of some Coalition politicians reflect global interest. All major bodies considering a global solution to cut carbon dioxide emissions, such as the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, say nuclear energy must be part of the mix. US President Joe Biden has set a target to produce small modular nuclear reactors at half the construction cost of today’s reactors. If the development succeeds, Australia should at least be able to consider its options. Ensuring safety will always be a government responsibility. But in keeping with a technology neutral approach, the decision is a matter for the market to decide.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
New virus of complacency will leave Australians idle	The Australian	We need a clear, forward-looking economic exit strategy
As Australians prepare for the Easter break, the relaxation this year has a completely different rhythm. A nation in shutdown because of coronavirus is already in a kind of holiday suspended animation. People are calling in to ask radio broadcasters to tell them what day it is when announcing the time.
Harsh restrictions on movement and gathering, working from home or not at all, and social isolation have put the economy into idle. Why? To flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections to a point where our hospital intensive care units can cope with the volume of critical cases, to save lives that can be saved. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says this “path of control and suppression” has bought us valuable time to prepare our disease-fighting resources. We are flattening the curve.
To date, only 8 per cent of the nation’s 6000 cases have required hospitalisation and ICU. The modelling our medical brains rely on, based on overseas data, confirms that with social distancing and an expansion in ICU capacity, everyone who needs an ICU bed in the course of the pandemic could access one. Some of the worst-case scenarios, simply letting the virus loose without curbs, would see almost 90 per cent of the population infected and ICUs overrun, with a daily demand for 35,000-plus ICU beds; only one-in-seven needing an ICU bed would get one. Our current medical strategy is working. Scott Morrison argues that, unlike many countries, we have the chance to respond from “a position of relative control”. “We can tailor our interventions to gain the most benefit and minimise the cost to society,” he said on Tuesday. Professor Murphy warns we must not fritter away the gains, so staying at home this Easter is a must. “Complacency is the biggest risk,” he says. Our leaders are not immune to the self-satisfaction virus either.
As well as saving lives, the goal must be to get our economy off life-support as soon as possible, at minimal cost. From the start, we have also been fighting an economic contagion, where complacency and policy drift can be just as dangerous. Economist Warren Hogan estimates the lockdowns will cost the economy $10bn to $15bn a month. A steep recession is being induced. The Morrison government’s disposition of “whatever it takes” is, as we described it on Saturday, a momentary neo-Whitlamist fiscal freak show. Three economic rescue packages are slated to cost $214bn, while a steady flow of niche measures — guarantees for private hospitals, free childcare and new health services — have added billions more. Add in state government emergency responses, as well as a slump in revenues, and the public sector debt bill is likely to be about $500bn.
We are not suggesting that national leaders have already slipped into a comfort zone or lost the plot. Certainly, the helter-skelter of the initial response, when medical officials were in the vanguard, has receded. Nor has the rescue spending been over the top. Better to do too much than too little in the short term. The key is to ensure the measures are targeted and temporary so, in the words of the Prime Minister, the nation can snap back — to mutual obligation and means-tested welfare arrangements, corporate self-reliance, liberalised trade, and free markets.
Picking this turning point will not be easy; nor will it be politically risk-free to pull back income support that people get used to, such as a doubling of the JobSeeker payment, the new $1500-a-fortnight JobKeeper allowance, or the changes to the partner pay income test for those on unemployment benefits.
As we have noted often in this crisis, the nine-member national cabinet acts co-operatively, swiftly and decisively. Yet politicians, however noble, diligent or community-spirited, do get an ego hit during a crisis. It does wonders for the standing of prime ministers, premiers and chief ministers. Poll ratings surge, voters hang on every word, even reporters ease off on what now seem like mundane questions of process and governance. Compared with these anointed saviours, political rivals can look like troublesome hacks or mere democratic accessories. The flip side is that the stakes are incredibly high. Failure is not an option.
But we do worry about the rhetorical promiscuity of the “new normal”. There is nothing normal about these times. Closing our borders to foreigners — the growth engine room of our new economy — and retarding commerce is definitely not normal. Sure, leaders need to prepare the community for what could be a painful six months of rolling disruptions; these novel social restrictions are alien to this land. But “sit-down money” is a curse. A $3000-a-month hiatus of beery backyard sessions and video-streaming binge nights looks very appealing to cashed-up young workers. But we need them to finish university studies and trades and get the economy roaring back to life.
Mr Morrison has flagged an exit strategy, because governments could not sustain support for an economy indefinitely in the deep freeze. The plan could see a series of trials, with some states easing restrictions earlier than others. Those moving first would get a competitive advantage, plus they would serve as test cases for others to learn from their experience. Areas hardest hit by COVID-19, such as NSW, Victoria and southeast Queensland, might learn lessons. When the time came, they could lift restrictions with confidence, Mr Morrison said. Pulling those levers will require nous and grit by state and territory leaders. The idea that restrictions could be in place until a vaccine is found, as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian suggested, is as absurd as it is defeatist. She retreated, rapidly, to another extreme: NSW restrictions could be lifted by May 1.
No one is suggesting the states and territories adopt foolhardy approaches, but they must be alive to opportunity and lift their game. There is money to be made in the upswing. We don’t mean by rent-seeking or grifting, although this free-money extravaganza can never stop those with an eye for the main chance. People with good ideas will emerge; they should be encouraged to flourish. State ministers must use this down time to prepare for economic revival. What taxes and charges can they forgo to attract investment and jobs? Are regulations on development holding back business formation? Do planning laws lead to optimal land use? National cabinet is a vehicle for getting things done in a crisis. But it can also be used as a prime mover to advance the “shifting the dial” productivity agenda, or even reforming the federation.
On Tuesday, the Prime Minister was asked by a reporter to sketch out what the nation would like after the crisis. He said the experience “will change many of us and our behaviours for a long time to come, and in some cases not in a necessarily bad way”. We will learn things. Mr Morrison noted COVID-19 would confirm that we need to be an open trading nation, which has been a core part of our prosperity for centuries. “But equally we need to look carefully at our domestic economic sovereignty as well, and these are issues that government, and particularly the federal government, is spending a lot of time focusing on at present,” he said.
Who doesn’t like being in control of their destiny? Stop idling and hop to it. The pandemic is putting new strains on our infrastructure, crisis planning, medical stockpiles and manufacturing. A lack of capability is being exposed as countries retreat to fortresses. So industry policy is back in vogue, the stale whiff of protectionism emanating from regional rumps. Let’s be sensible and strategic. Of course we want to be a country that makes things, from dunny paper to the world’s most expensive submarines. But we are at our best when we export to the world, not when we push scarce resources into sectors that cannot compete globally. Mr Morrison has appointed a business advisory group to work with officials to map a trajectory out of the economic morass. Private business must be at the heart of it, but not via subsidies. We can’t allow the traumas of COVID-19 to take Australia back to the Leyland P76.We are approaching a moment of policy transition. Medical experts have guided public messaging and social restrictions, until now. The very fact we have not had the medical calamities of Italy, Spain or the US, for instance, is testament to their sound advice and our compliance. The medicos ensured politicians moved early and hard with travel bans and quarantine. The falling rate of infections and more local data about community transmission will give authorities confidence to calibrate the next moves. The challenge for our political leaders is to find a medical setting, more likely site-specific settings, to protect the most vulnerable while getting oxygen back into the economy. A mighty fiscal transfusion is boosting household income, but there’s precious little to spend it on during a shutdown. Before winter, we have to establish what infection rate we can live with, given a vaccine is a long way off. Our politicians can’t take it for granted that the economy will eventually right itself. Without leadership and courage, and a strategy for economic resurrection, idle Australia will lose muscle mass, motivation and direction.	8	prime ministers; political leadership; politics prime
Best way to attack debt and deficits is to go for growth	The Australian	We need an ambitious game plan for jobs and investment
Josh Frydenberg and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann are sitting on an ugly set of numbers. Thursday’s economic statement will reveal the deepest fiscal hole since World War II. Last year’s budget forecast of a “back in the black” surplus has been obliterated; this year’s deficit could end up twice as large, or around 10 per cent of gross domestic product. It’s a rolling financial catastrophe, as emergency spending and a huge drop in revenue conspire to open up a vast sea of red.
The Morrison government has pencilled in — no one would be so silly to plot anything in ink — stimulus of $289bn across two years. The bulk of it is direct fiscal action, with $164bn going in wage subsidies, welfare payments and cash injections. The remainder is for loan guarantees to provide companies with balance sheet support.
The government argues this splurge will have prevented the loss of 700,000 jobs, lowering the unemployment peak by five percentage points. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, with little left in the monetary policy arsenal, endorsed the first phase of JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments, ahead of the government’s $20bn tinkering. On Tuesday, Dr Lowe said direct transfers to households and businesses, and increased spending on infrastructure and public health, were “manageable and affordable”, given solid public finances and low interest rates. This is what governments do — they use their balance sheets to smooth out shocks to private incomes. It’s why we endorse budget repair, to achieve fiscal balance over the course of the business cycle. So when trouble comes — like a financial crisis, slump in commodity prices or a pandemic — governments have a fiscal buffer. In the present, to do “whatever it takes” to save lives and livelihoods and to “build a bridge” to recovery, as the central bank chief is wont to say.
At some point, Dr Lowe said, there needs to be a fiscal consolidation and a reduction in public debt relative to national output. Why? Can’t Dr Lowe just keep printing money and drop it from the RBA’s helicopter into the hungry mouths of employers and workers, as the fad prophets advise? No. “The tab always has to be paid and it is paid out of taxes and government revenues in one form or another,” he said. When the time comes to address the debt mountain — and that day has not yet come into view, except for a Labor outfit striking a pose — the best way to do so is through economic growth. The relapse in Victoria, which recorded a new daily high of 484 cases of COVID-19, will be a drag on growth in the September quarter. The six-week lockdown is affecting confidence well beyond the southern state’s borders. Stop-go-stop-go is no way to run an economy or society, whether trying to reopen a Melbourne restaurant, as John Lethlean reported on Wednesday, or running a school, tourism business or sporting competition. Such uncertainty immediately hits consumer spending and, more worryingly for the future, leads to shelving of investment plans.
The budget update is likely to show a drop of 6 per cent in private investment last financial year, followed by a plunge of 12 per cent in the current one. The capital slump points to a less dynamic economy and lower rates of growth in the recovery; workers will be less productive because they will be using outdated tools, software and machines.
Australia has solid fundamentals, as the RBA chief tirelessly observes, while trying to pump up our tyres as growth engines sit in idle. Scott Morrison has put bold growth targets in lights. He declared we should aim to expand the economy at an above-trend rate of around 3.75 per cent a year for the next five years. That’s a lot of aspiration for an old engine, one that hasn’t had a proper rebuild in two decades. Rather than outlining a road map to achieving this goal, the mini-budget is a mere pit stop on the way to the Treasurer’s fiscal extravaganza, which has been pushed back to October 6. His second budget is expected to fast-track personal income tax cuts, while business will benefit via an investment allowance. While the big decisions have not yet been taken, the Morrison government has groups working in parallel on a recovery strategy, including on manufacturing, industrial relations reform and energy.
Of course, success in suppressing the rate of coronavirus infections is the key assumption for revival. Mr Morrison also has emphasised the importance of workplace flexibility to job creation; the crisis settings by businesses for rosters, job sharing, working from home and pay rates will run for some time, probably into next year. As the Prime Minister indicated on Tuesday, whether or not the government strikes a deal with the ACTU in current talks, he will push on with his desired industrial reforms in the parliament. On several occasions since March, we have urged Mr Morrison not to waste this crisis. To control and reduce what Mr Frydenberg described as an “eye-watering” deficit, not burden the next generation, restore the lost jobs and lift our standard of living, we need an ambitious game plan. Practical measures such as reducing regulation, cutting energy costs, improving the tax incentives to invest and innovate, and having flexible work rules will help us achieve the growth rates we need.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Cancel culture is no joke, it’s civilisational self-harm	The Australian	We need honest thinking aloud to solve our social problems Cancel culture is a misnomer. The film Gone With the Wind will never be gone, even if outrage darkens the screen for a while. The list of cultural objects and people to be targeted keeps growing — indigenous movie Jedda, sitcom Fawlty Towers and satirist Chris Lilley all figured in Saturday’s article by Rosemary Neill and Max Maddison — but nothing and nobody is really cancelled. We just pretend they are, while ideas or views deemed incorrect go underground, sometimes defiant, sometimes morphing into the extremes of our already polarised society. The war on humour is not a joke, and is just another front in the campaign against open minds and dissent.
Cancel culture can be dramatic and bring immediate gratification. Cultural products and historical eras take a pummelling, careers are junked and sometimes something momentous happens: a Twitter account gets vaporised. But these are all victories built on defeat, a tacit admission by activists that they cannot compete in a fair fight with contrary arguments, with sceptics or critics. And they impose the costs of their failings on the rest of us.
For every incautious public figure put in stocks online and pelted with abuse, there are hundreds who keep their heads down and get the message: there’s no upside in making an honest or informed contribution to solving a difficult social issue if it’s capable of being reduced to a booby-trapped identity politics cause. Much better to chant the latest slogans with the mob. Punishments and rewards such as this are calculated to create an uncivil society with unsolvable problems.
Science and technology are inseparable from modern achievement, but even they go wrong without a climate that prizes good-faith thinking aloud about genuinely difficult problems, and these are often the hot-button issues that derange social justice warriors. A society that works, that is capable of fixing things and making progress, has to be able to draw out the talents and goodwill of its citizens, giving them room to have big, open-ended discussions where fact and argument can close the gap between extremes and find pragmatic solutions in the middle ground. It’s inevitable that sometimes people will get the tone wrong or misconstrue a problem, but constantly taking offence and hitting the cancel button takes us only further away from the objective of social progress in the real world.
Cancel culture is caught up with symbols and language, adept at the worst possible interpretation, indifferent to context and human fallibility. Its response to actual suffering is utopian hype and this means the purity tests get ever stricter. Today’s tormentor is tomorrow’s tormented. Witness comic actor Josh Thomas. One moment he was cancelling Coon cheese, the next he was being dragged on Twitter for ancient musings about the travails of multiculti casting. It’s true cancel culture is overwhelmingly a vice of self-identified “progressives”, but conservatives should not exult if cancellers are cancelled. When anyone feels compelled to abase themselves in public with a ritualistic confession, everyone who witnesses it shares in the humiliation. This kind of thing is an insult to contrition and remorse, which are profound human qualities. It’s striking that cancel culture and wrongthink lynch mobs are strongest in the Anglosphere. Here is a new puritanism, but this time with no hope of redemption for sinners. It goes under a secular banner of social justice with a bland “safetyism” in which unliked words are supposedly body blows.
Progressive opinionistas one moment insist cancel culture is not even a thing; the next they trivialise it as if freedom of speech is just licence to make racist jokes. No freethinkers barrack for racism but it’s perfectly legitimate to argue that anti-racism has become so overzealous, applying a jaundiced lens of race to every controversy, that it tends to promote the evil it claims to oppose: a toxic obsession with race as an attribute of overriding importance. What’s being cancelled is not only elective entertainment but also essential ideas. In the public square of social media, where at our peril much of our politics now takes place, discussion and voices at odds with progressive groupthink are routinely shut down. A narrow progressivism focused on symbols rather than reality is influential also in major corporations, the bureaucracy, many media outlets and higher education. It is shielded by an emotive culture of taking offence, and this is vulnerable to the twin attack of ridicule and reason. That is why comedy is targeted as well as open conversation. It’s a mistake to see this as inevitable, as if Generation Z is totally woke and will inherit the Earth. The bad ideas driving cancel culture come from baby boomers long entrenched in institutions. Their gatekeeping is far from universally popular with young people, and there are signs of growing restiveness with the state of constant anxiety and group conformism that is life in the social media police state. Don’t assume youth will tolerate their freedoms being put in a state of suspended animation.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Reality time for gender clinics	The Australian	We need thoughtful debate, not dogma, if we’re to help young people Children are being given experimental medical treatment with potentially profound consequences — including lost years of identity development, infertility as adults and impaired sexual function, and lifelong dependence on hormone drugs — such that they cannot give informed consent. This is the conclusion of the first serious judicial scrutiny of the recent surge in teenagers, mostly born female, declaring a transgender identity and receiving medical interventions supposed to refashion their bodies to fit an inner sense of “gender identity”. The ruling of the UK High Court in a challenge brought by Keira Bell, 23, who seeks to warn that medicalised gender change may be a harmful short-term fix for unrelated underlying issues such as trauma, has international implications.
The court did not dispute that specialists at gender clinics mean well, that these young people are indeed distressed and that those with faith in the “gender-affirming” approach and its hormonal interventions do believe they promote mental wellbeing and even prevent suicide. Trouble is, given the opportunity, the gender-affirming experts were unable to present quality evidence for their claims, and the judges accepted competing evidence that using drugs to suspend normal puberty might well lock children as young as 10-15 into a lifelong path of medical intervention with significant risks. The National Health Service Tavistock youth gender clinic failed to supply the court with basic data about treatment and patients. Neither did the Tavistock offer any clinical explanation for the worrying way in which teenage girls so rapidly emerged as the dominant group diagnosed with a condition once almost solely the preserve of preschool boys.
Lack of data and a failure to investigate worrying trends in treatment and regret are red flags. Australia’s major youth gender clinics insist they follow rigorous clinical standards but they have refused to release comprehensive data or to engage with informed critics. Can governments ignore an influential court ruling that young people are being given experimental medicine?
We use the same common law rule at issue in the Tavistock case, yet our Family Court has decided that children as young as 10 can give informed consent to puberty blocker drugs and a 15-year-old can authorise her own double mastectomy. These cases, involving superficial analysis and expert evidence only from the “gender-affirming” school, are likely to disturb hospital administrators, ethics boards and health department lawyers who compare them with the English judges’ careful reasoning based on current science, data and clinical insights. It may be that the Tavistock’s lawyers will identify possible appeal arguments, but it is striking that so much of the criticism of the ruling avoids the issues in favour of outrage about “transphobia”. What’s needed is open, thoughtful debate about the best response to this new group of often troubled teenagers being diagnosed with the bodily distress known as gender dysphoria.
This will need more therapeutic options, not less. Despite a weak evidence base the gender-affirming approach is so dogmatic that it champions the new wave of criminal laws against any therapy deemed to try to “convert” someone’s gender identity, Victoria being the latest with a draft bill. Cruel attempts to force adults to change sexual orientation appear to be mostly a historical footnote. Laws such as Victoria’s could criminalise ethical attempts to help a trans-identifying teenage girl re-embrace her biological sex and find comfort in her body after the trauma of sexual assault. But counselling to assist medicalised gender change for children is exempt from these cookie-cutter bans on conversion therapy. The risk is that some minors struggling with non-gender issues will seize on trans identity as a solution, will be uncritically “affirmed” by teachers or counsellors at school, and will be put on the path to needless medication. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has asked the states to come up with a national framework for treatment of under-18 gender dysphoria, with an emphasis on “strong and balanced counselling”. But the process for this is not transparent and works by consensus, so it is hostage to uncooperative states. The major gender clinics are in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Their governments have shown no serious engagement with international concerns about the affirmation model and its medical treatments. The first two support conversion therapy bans, and WA’s intentions are unclear. These laws could mean cautious, ethical psychotherapists will avoid taking on children who present with gender issues. Who suffers then? And states with laws that risk criminalising any therapy unless it’s the “affirmative” handmaid of gender transition are not serious about a new framework with balanced counselling.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Time to shift gears from JobKeeper to real jobs	The Australian	We need to fire up the creative engines of private enterprise
We have begun the fraught transition from emergency fiscal measures amid pandemic shock towards the goal of a COVID-safe economy capable of underpinning the decent living standards that too many Australians take for granted. It will not be easy; anyone who makes categorical predictions in these unprecedented times risks giving rise to needless fear or false hope. It’s no surprise there is sharp disagreement about the best policy path ahead, how to handle trade-offs and which competing values should be given priority. But make no mistake — there will be costs, dislocation and suffering, whatever we do. The question is how best to minimise these in the enduring national interest.
Anthony Albanese gives voice to the sizeable body of opinion that concedes in theory that JobKeeper and other such emergency measures cannot go on forever, while protesting it is reckless and heartless for the federal government to begin unwinding them. But this is not a choice between sustainable compassion on the one hand and ruthless fiscal consolidation on the other. The Morrison government will continue to preside over an extraordinarily high level of public spending. It is a question of how and to what end that spending is best directed.
JobKeeper and associated measures were right for the time. It was anti-pandemic policy that put the economy in a coma, and it made sense to subsidise businesses to keep staff and their skills job-ready for reopening. This prevented not only enormous economic loss but a great deal of human suffering and social dislocation. But it is not sustainable. More than $100bn in public money has gone in direct support for people and companies. A budget surplus of $7.1bn had been predicted for 2019-20; the result is a deficit of $85.3bn.
Necessary as it was, JobKeeper has downsides. It has kept alive some businesses that are past their use-by date and postponed the task of their staff getting retrained or redeployed, something that gets harder the longer it is put off. Pandemic support measures also distort incentives; some young people have been able to boost their savings because JobKeeper has been more generous than their previous, modest income. Like welfare, these pandemic measures are a vital safety net when they work well but corrosive of hope and aspiration if they create long-term dependence. It is not compassionate for the state to finance purposeless inactivity. Before COVID, Australia — similar to many developed countries — had pockets of multi-generational welfare dependence and social dysfunction. Pandemic policy has seen the scale and reach of government activity and authority expand, but not always its competence, as the experience of Victoria shows. At the same time, notwithstanding the undoubted value of JobKeeper, we should not forget the businesses that have already collapsed from lack of demand; many of these have been family enterprises built up through the years with nobody working government office hours. In some quarters, especially among public sector elites, there is amnesia about the fact that no state, let alone an enlarged one, can be financed without a thriving private sector economy. The federal Opposition Leader’s rhetoric panders to this reality bypass.
As Paul Kelly foreshadowed in these pages on Saturday, the pragmatic course is to shift public spending from emergency support to aid revival of the real economy: tax breaks, including for business investment; reforming regulations on insolvency and credit so small business can prosper; industry incentives to encourage manufacturing and greater economic self-reliance; competitively priced energy inputs; less red tape; subsidies for employers willing to put on workers; and a sharper policy focus on skills and job-relevant higher education. None of this involves savage spending cuts with a cold-hearted aim at an early budget surplus. Rather, the rationale is to get the private sector engine running, thereby creating the conditions in which fiscal consolidation will become feasible — in time. True, the withdrawal of JobKeeper will bring hardship and difficulty. But so will the false promise that such a program can be sustained indefinitely. Going for growth looks like a better bet for most people across the medium to long term. Along the way, for those who need it, we have an enviable social security net, skills retraining, and help from volunteer agencies, families and friends. And there will be new opportunities as well because pandemic is also a spur to innovation, reform and technology workarounds. The challenge is to get moving on adapting the economy to the new reality, and for this we need to keep easing restrictions — above all in Victoria, where there is a bizarre disparity between severe lockdown and the modest scale of new infections. This is not just a matter of a return to normal life for long-suffering Victorians; it is a national economic imperative. Australia’s future is more important than Premier Daniel Andrews’s legacy.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Flattening curve while not obliterating our economy	The Australian	We need to keep people in work and small businesses viable
The national strategy to deal with the evolving coronavirus pandemic has been “flattening the curve” of infection. That’s why the government closed our borders, is limiting public gatherings and imposing social isolation, and is urging people to wash their hands. By spreading out the period of contagion, reducing the number of ill people at any one time, we reduce the pressure on health systems, especially on intensive care units. Of course, there’s a trade-off: social distancing measures are hitting the economy like a sledgehammer.
By flattening the curve, economics editor Adam Creighton explained on Tuesday, the economic pain is drawn out. “Businesses that could survive two months of shutdown might not be able to survive four,” he wrote. Scott Morrison now says the government’s $17.6bn stimulus is only a start. The package is trying to keep businesses afloat through payments and wage subsidies, providing tax breaks for investment, and putting cash into the hands of those most likely to spend. Accelerated depreciation rates and instant asset write-offs, we argued last week, appear like the ad hoc things you do to prod companies into expansion when the economy is going sideways.
We are facing a deep recession, with some experts fearing an economic depression, which is a 10 per cent contraction in gross domestic product. Financial markets are responding to what’s happening in society and the real economy, purging their riskiest assets, repricing even safe bets. The Reserve Bank is about to fire its final shot on interest rates, then it’s off to the debt shop and printery. There isn’t much our central bank can do on the demand side; its main game now is supervision, financial stability and liquidity, which all build confidence.
The Prime Minister and his brains trust are working on stimulus 2.0. The initial package, yet to be legislated, is not quite dead on arrival. But it’s becoming clear one of its vaunted design virtues — scalability — will immediately be tested. So, too, will existing delivery systems. How will they perform when IT platforms are inundated and public servants, meant to oversee the handouts ATM, are crook or looking after kids stuck at home? The public sector is playing its role. Those hardy automatic stabilisers — higher welfare payments, lower tax collections — will kick in. The fiscal footprint is about to spread. The states are stepping in with rescue packages. NSW is providing payroll tax and licence fee relief, and increasing construction spending. Queensland will defer taxes on business and provide interest-free loans.
The greatest challenge will be to keep people in jobs. Qantas, for instance, is cutting international flights by 90 per cent. It’s a big company, yet will struggle to hold its workers without assistance. But entire sectors have no buffer when customers disappear; wages, rent and loans are due. Casuals and gig-economy workers will feel the pinch. Banks are providing leeway on credit and energy companies will keep the power on; as we know, they are not charitable institutions. It’s clear the cashflow assistance from Canberra’s first fiscal hit will require more booster shots. One novel measure that could help sole traders and small businesses is a loan facility based on the Higher Education Contribution Scheme.
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann warns that businesses will close and people will lose jobs. During the early 1990s recession — which was policy-induced — it took 12 months for the jobless rate to jump from 6.6 per cent to 9.5 per cent. The unemployment rate peaked at 11.1 per cent a year later and it wasn’t until late 1999 that it recovered to 6.5 per cent. The welfare safety net exists for such calamities. It might need to be modified, temporarily, until this epidemiological and economic bolt from the blue has run its course.Keeping small businesses viable must be a top-order issue. So, too, is making sure skills don’t wither and workers are ready for the eventual recovery. What at first required a targeted, sector-by-sector, fiscal rescue effort is morphing into an emergency maxi-budget. The highest economic priority for government should be to help businesses keep people employed — while continuing to lean forcefully on the COVID-19 infection rate until the medical pressures subside.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
Stopping CCP’s sleeper agents	The Australian	We need to protect Hong Kong’s migrants and refugees
Amid security woes and human rights abuses in Hong Kong, the Morrison government wisely has adjusted policy on migration, extradition and travel advice. Canberra has offered special visas for Hong Kong Chinese, including a five-year graduate visa for Hong Kong students, five-year temporary skilled visas and incentives to attract highly skilled migrants and businesses; it has suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong; and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised Australians not to travel to Hong Kong, and for Australians living there and concerned about the draconian security law to reconsider their need to remain. Used to neither pushback nor another’s free will, the Chinese Communist Party government was flummoxed like a thwarted suitor in a Mills & Boon story. Australia, you’re “not irreplaceable”, the CCP moaned in its English-language daily.
Scott Morrison said the moves were about sovereignty, made “rationally and soberly and consistently”. See a problem, fix it, move on. Some argue we should be doing more to provide a safe haven for refugees. Acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge said the 10,000 Hong Kong passport holders currently here “almost certainly” would be able to get permanent residency if they met character and security tests. While Canberra expects a wave of asylum claims — 137 Hong Kong Chinese applied for refugee status last year — Hong Kong nationals are urging the government to undertake strict political vetting of those fleeing the territory, fearing CCP supporters could take advantage of the resettlement offer.
As Ben Packham revealed on Monday, Beijing could plant sleeper agents here, while the children of senior CCP officials studying in Australia also could seek a path to permanent residency. As well, some migrants to Australia fear the families of Hong Kong police members, who led a year-long battle with pro-democracy protesters, could seek Australian residency. Mr Tudge told Packham national security “is our No 1 priority”. He said a strict character- and security-checking regime applies to all applicants. So it should. There are fears in the Chinese diaspora and in political and security circles that CCP agents could slip into the country. ASIO director-general Mike Burgess believes the level of threat to us from espionage and interference is unprecedented. “It is higher now than it was at the height of the Cold War,” he said in February.
Naturally, Hong Kong refugees and migrants would be CCP targets, leaned on by local arms of the CCP’s global influence arm, the United Front Work Department. Under Xi Jinping, this vast network of subversion — influencing politicians, meddling in Chinese communities and stealing technologies — has been well documented by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The system undermines our social cohesion, fuels racial tension, harms media integrity and facilitates spying. Writing in Inquirer on Saturday, Paul Monk drew attention to Operation Fox Hunt. For six years Mr Xi’s agents have been “tracking and intimidating hundreds of Chinese emigres on all manner of grounds inside Western countries”. Last week, US FBI director Christopher Wray spoke at length about Fox Hunt’s “shocking” tactics in a relentless pursuit of dissidents and Mr Xi’s critics. Hong Kong’s new security law, Monk explained, was of a piece with this “brutal modus operandi”. Lies, coercion, the diplomatic “deep freeze”, even claims of an Australian spying “offensive”, are part of the CCP’s tool kit. If we are to counteract this onslaught, we need to understand its structures, agencies, methods and effects. Canberra has updated foreign interference and espionage laws, toughened up investment screening, banned Huawei from the 5G network and put curbs on foreign donations to political parties. Yet somehow Beijing sees our latest domestic housekeeping as an affront, with the visa changes akin to “interfering in China’s internal affairs”. Inconceivable! Again, we have to be vigilant in standing up for values, protecting our institutions — political parties, businesses, universities and media — and providing hope and safety to the thousands of talented, hardworking and vulnerable people who have come here, and will continue to come, to start a new life.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
China exploits the crisis in seeking to divide and rule	The Australian	We should be wary, but hard-nosed about our trade destiny
An anguished world, plagued by death and economic destruction, deserves the truth about the coronavirus. COVID-19 has infected 4.2 million people, claimed almost 300,000 lives and put tens of millions out of work. That China is shamed for its culpability, or obliged to pay reparations, is not the purpose of an international inquiry. Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Marise Payne have fronted international calls for an independent probe into the outbreak that has caused havoc. The principles at stake are accountability and transparency. China, chastened yet forever opportunistic, is positioned to exploit the pandemic: more repression at home and global dominance.
Our robust democracy is running in circles, exhaling in a cacophony of voices — big egos, commercial interests and politicking. Usually on national security there is bipartisanship. But normal politics, having emerged from a furlough of social isolation, accentuates small differences. Labor admonishes Senator Payne for her low-key method on China policy, compared with a vocal posse of backbench MPs. One critic foolishly, bizarrely said the government was playing “deputy sheriff” to the US. Canberra was early out of the blocks on a global inquiry. Hyperkinetic attention-seekers such as Kevin Rudd and Julie Bishop — former foreign ministers with harsh lessons in dancing with Beijing — have slouched in to lazy punditry. Self-interested magnates, too, should concentrate on commerce and leave strategic policy to those whose first duty is the national interest.
The noise and froth suits Beijing’s shock troops. It is a distraction from questions about the pandemic’s source. As well, it feeds China’s “wolf warriors” red meat. The Chinese Communist Party’s playbook is to disrupt, divide and distort, at the best of times. But with COVID-19 the CCP has its back to the wall, lashing out instinctively. After Boris Johnson’s government backed a global virus inquiry, China’s envoy to London declared British MPs were “addicted to their Cold War mentality”, thus poisoning relations. From France to Brazil, such belligerence to hosts carries Chinese President Xi Jinping’s imprimatur. Last year he demanded envoys show a new “fighting spirit”.
The gambit of Beijing’s mouthy ambassador to Canberra, Cheng Jingye, was to intimidate, warning there would be trade retaliation against Australia for daring to push for an inquiry. Senator Payne responded calmly, but directly, calling out the bullying as “economic coercion”. Yet we are facing an 80 per cent tariff on barley and suspension of beef into China from our producers. China’s foreign ministry claims it’s a technical matter, to “secure the health and safety of Chinese consumers”. But what about the wellbeing of the rest of the world? China insists it is ready to work with others to promote that. “We hope relevant parties will do more to enhance mutual trust instead of talking one thing while doing the other,” the ministry said in a statement. Here are the CCP’s two faces: a smile for clueless locals, a scowl for foreign devils.
Yet China did nothing to protect the world from the worst of this calamity. As we detailed on Saturday, late last year when the coronavirus emerged in Hubei province, the CCP denied, delayed, obfuscated, punished the messengers, and showed a reckless disregard for the rest of the world. Its malign propaganda and cringe-worthy philanthropy are shameless, if not predictable. The CCP surely welcomes the useful fools aiding its message and strategic assault. That’s the cold truth of misguided interventions, from Andrew Forrest’s recent stunt to the pensioned doves and pandas in our midst. Well before anyone had heard of Wuhan, China’s growing militarism, territorial grab, debt-trap financing, interference and espionage were dominating geopolitics. For Beijing, pandemic or not, the long march continues.
For us the challenges are manifold, marked by traps and dilemmas. The pandemic legacy weakens our financial position and intensifies tension with China. As former head of both the departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade, Dennis Richardson, told Paul Kelly, government cannot be turned over to a vast national security agenda fuelled by anti-China thoughts, pandemic-induced security alarms, protectionist industry policy, and elevation of security over economic in foreign investment decisions. “A strong economy is foundational to national security,” he said. But we should be wary, realistic and seize our destiny.Trade is mutually beneficial. How could it not be? China craves our iron ore, coal and gas. There is no cut-price alternative. Still, it is prudent to push for free trade globally, and to diversify into new markets, especially for premium offerings such as education, tourism, medicines, food and wine. That means governments must reduce the cost to business of regulation, energy and tax so it can compete; price infrastructure sensibly for investors and taxpayers, so we get goods to market reliably; prepare our young for the jobs of the future. The nation must hold its nerve in the face of Beijing’s taunts and trade disruptions and maintain pressure for a COVID-19 inquiry for the sake of all humanity. We can use this horrible crisis to strengthen our foundations and assert our values.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Celebrate, but also keep a weather eye	The New Zealand Herald	We should celebrate success.
Let’s pause to recognise how spectacular the latest unemployment figure of 4.9 per cent is.
Economists were gobsmacked, staggered, flabbergasted, and astonished — you could take your pick of adjectives on Wednesday.
Not even the most wildly optimistic forecasters imagined New Zealand’s economy would remain so robust with the borders closed.
The incredible run of economic data across the past few months has largely ended the debate about the relative merits of New Zealand’s Covid-19 elimination strategy. It worked.
We have spent less time locked down than nations that dithered. Our economy has performed better.
Our Government got it right. Support packages like the wage subsidy have worked as hoped.
Defying the dire predictions of National leader Judith Collins there was no “tsunami” of job losses when the scheme ended. Business and workers used the time to adapt to the new economic conditions.
Treasury’s accounts are in better shape than expected and the nation will need to borrow less.
Finance Minister Grant Robertson deserves a pat on the back. When the history is written he’ll likely deserve more credit than that. But, right now, we can’t afford to pause for long.
First and most obviously, the immediate challenges of the pandemic remain live. There is still time for a Covid-19 outbreak to undo all our good work. New Zealand’s success in dealing with the pandemic and our relatively strong economic position puts us at the forefront of the “normalisation challenge” facing the world’s policy makers. How long can the tap of government fiscal support and central bank money printing stay on?
How long can interest rates stay at record lows before economies start to overheat? The official answer is probably: for some time yet. So far central banks and most governments around the world have indicated an intention to lean heavily towards supporting their economies until they are absolutely sure recession risks have faded. But financial markets always look forward. In New Zealand, thanks to the absence of the virus, we are already ahead of that curve. Investors are watching the constant upward revision of economic forecasts closely and revising the time frames for Reserve Bank interest rate moves. They may not be imminent but they are now forecast to come sooner rather than later. Talk of negative interest rates is off the table. Mortgage rates could rise from record lows sooner as expectations are priced in.
With the housing market and sharemarket running perilously hot there is worldwide concern about what happens when interest rates rise.
Fund managers are already poised to pull back to defensive investment positions. That’s not so easy for those who may have over extended with million-dollar mortgages. We need to stay alert to a whole new set of economic risks. So let’s celebrate success. But let’s not be a victim of it.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Clever policy tuning beats shock-and-awe lockdowns	The Australian	We should not allow odd lapses to inspire more self-inflicted damage West Australian Premier Mark McGowan did the right thing by deciding to go ahead with reopening his state on Tuesday to the country’s two most populous jurisdictions, NSW and Victoria. It’s the right thing for a nation that desperately needs to rebuild social and economic links after the dispiriting fragmentation of COVID-19 lockdowns and border restrictions. And the inward flow of cashed-up visitors and long-missed relatives will be welcomed by WA businesses and families, many of whom had doubted that a Christmas reunion would be possible.
However, Mr McGowan persists with his unbalanced rhetoric as if Western Australia were a fragile fortress with a drawbridge that will instantly go back up the moment there is a breakout of infection anywhere else in the country. Last weekend there was a minor scare involving two German travellers who managed to avoid quarantine on landing in Sydney and instead boarded a flight to Melbourne. They later tested negative for COVID-19, but Mr McGowan ominously declared this was “certainly not the gold standard” of quarantine control associated with NSW. Given the Premier’s parochial track record of opting for more severe restrictions than other states, it’s not surprising there was speculation he might delay the reopening to NSW and Victoria.
This storm in a teacup would puzzle people in Europe and the US, who must contend with new infections and mortality on a scale that makes the posturing of some of our premiers look ridiculous. The reality is that Australia has enviably low levels of COVID infection, yet there will be new cases and occasional outbreaks. Some lapses in generally robust quarantine systems and infection control are probably unavoidable in the months ahead as we wait for effective vaccines to reach enough of the population to confer herd immunity.
The issue is not whether new infections will occur but how effectively authorities and the community respond. It may be that a minor incident does us a backhanded service in revealing a systemic flaw that, when corrected, prevents a future, more serious outbreak. WA has a new mandatory contact tracing register and app that will need to be bedded down. Rapid deployment of testing and tracing requires constant practice and vigilance, and effective co-ordination of teams at multiple levels of the bureaucracy and out across the population. These systems can be overwhelmed by a major viral breakout, but the apparent safety of lockdown can breed complacency and deny test and trace teams the benefit of practice and constant learning.
Lockdown has appeal because it’s a strong and dramatic message that lends itself to political theatre and an image of resolve. But the real test of leadership and government lies in the unsung but successful co-ordination of many dispersed activities that together make public health measures such as quarantine, infection control and contact tracing effective. This doesn’t lend itself to puffed-chest announcements on the evening news, but there is an art in subtle, consistent messaging from authorities so people are given accurate information and pragmatic advice that enables them to make sensible judgments about risks and trade-offs.
There’s no doubt that Victoria’s lockdown has brought the virus under control, and WA’s hard lockdown enjoyed a degree of popular support surprising to outsiders. But self-righteous celebration of lockdown is odd. Ignore the bluster in public; any sane leader recognises lockdown as proof that the machinery of government was not effective enough to make a success of moderate measures, such that catastrophic harm to economy and society could not be avoided as byproducts of a shutdown. But those costs may seem distant to lockdown enthusiasts, especially if they’re more likely to be carried by others, such as small businesses lacking in political clout, while promulgation of long lists of banned activities looks like immediate action, if not a solution. However, lockdown is a fast-diminishing currency as businesses go broke and taxpayers become welfare recipients. The same goes for states as public debt rapidly accumulates. Now both Victoria and NSW have had their credit ratings cut by S&P Global Ratings, and of course it’s the state that had a severe lockdown that has suffered the more severe downgrade. Blunt policy can have brutal consequences.	9	hotels motels; motels quarantine; covid19 quarantine
Reforms for not-so-super funds	The Australian	We shouldn’t tolerate lack of transparency and fee-gouging The superannuation reforms linked to Tuesday’s federal budget are sensible and overdue. Josh Frydenberg has announced an end to the racket whereby workers can be “defaulted” into multiple separate super funds as they shift from job to job. A default system is necessary because many people, especially the young, take little active interest in retirement savings. But the way the system works encourages funds to maximise fees — $33bn a year all up, more than we spend on household energy — rather than serve the interests of members. It also gives funds more reason to lavish hospitality on corporate folk with the power to anoint a fund as the default for employees. When Ken Hayne wrote his 2019 final report into the industry, he noted that about 40 per cent of Australians with super had more than one account. So, it’s a no-brainer to follow the consolidation of multiple accounts with a tweaked default system so that someone new to the labour force is defaulted just once, with that account moving with the worker from job to job.
As well, the government will set the banking regulator to benchmark fund performance, which is often pretty unimpressive, as Mr Hayne pointed out. Starting with basic MySuper accounts, a fund that underperforms across two consecutive years will be blocked from taking any new members until it lifts its game. This should help increase the pressure on funds to perform, pressure that in many cases is sorely needed. For those people who do track and compare superannuation results, the good news is more transparency with a YourSuper portal. Again, the rationale is to put the heat on fund managers to maximise members’ returns. Further ahead, there’s the promise of smarter payroll software to automate delivery of information and streamline choice of fund. The sharper focus offered by the interactive YourSuper portal is timely because it’s possible that the pandemic hit to incomes and super account balances — and potentially the capacity of the commonwealth to finance the pension — may motivate a bigger slice of the labour force to pay careful attention to retirement savings. Mr Frydenberg also has flagged accountability measures and new obligations to hold trustees to their duty to act in the best financial interests of members. This agent-principal problem lies at the heart of many shortcomings. It’s not just the obvious commercial self-interest of a retail fund but also the institutional conflict of trustees “representing” trade unions in industry funds. At the Hayne royal commission, trustees made it seem that discerning the best interests of members was a hideously complex task. As Mr Hayne commented in his report: “It should be concerning to regulators that professional trustees apparently struggle to understand their most fundamental obligation.” The reforms outlined by the Treasurer are a step in the right direction, but lasting change will require a cultural shift — and real moral clarity — in the industry entrusted with $3 trillion of our savings.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
COMMENT Limiting sports chat at work? It’s just not cricket	The Daily Post	We talked on Newstalk ZB about devout sports fans being at risk of heart attacks when they get so intense about games, and now I see sports fans are also under threat of being censured at work due to too much “sports chat”.
The Head of the Chartered Management Institute in the UK, Ann Francke, has said — to much controversy, I might add — that employers should crack down on “sports chat” in the workplace because it “excludes women” and, wait for it, encourages “laddish” behaviour.
She says, if sports chat is left unchecked, it can lead to (God forbid) “boorish banter”.
Critics were quick to point out that, if we’re going to start banning things to talk about at work, could what TV shows you’ve watched, and stories about your kids also be banned?
Because (sorry to break it to you) it turns out we are all different and we wouldn’t mind all being able to talk about different things and, actually, we can work out for ourselves what those things are, just as we have for many, many years.
Telling the world that women feel excluded during sports chat sounds like it comes from a person who is herself intimidated by sports chat.
It’s also very sexist. Who says women don’t like sport?
Does this woman know there are actually women who play sport? And that there are whole teams throughout the world made up of (gasp) women. In sport. And that the world of sports media is awash with ... women?
The female head of this major business body says bosses should actively work to “curtail male staff talking about football, cricket and rugby, in case women feel ... left out”. Give me strength.
The only useful thing she could do, on behalf of women, is ask that bosses actively work to offer women equal opportunities, support women in the workplace, and pay women more. That’s about it.
If we go down the track of banning things we can and can’t talk about at work, we are just setting up artificial environments and turning people into robots.
What’s next? A spreadsheet on arrival at the office of what can be covered off and what can’t? “How are you?” Whoops, no that may offend, too personal. Come on.
Chatting at work is how collegial friendships and workplace relationships are formed. Getting to know your colleagues is crucial to a happy and thriving workplace, surely? A bunch of people scared to talk to each other in case the topic causes offence is surely a giant step backwards.
Surely women bored witless by a colleague’s cricket commentary can simply walk away?

Another defeat in the info wars	The Australian	We urgently need updated incentives for tech-era media On Monday the highest court in NSW upheld a ruling that media organisations are liable as publishers for defamatory comments posted on their Facebook pages. The context is a case brought by Dylan Voller, a former inmate of Darwin’s Don Dale Youth Detention Centre. The media organisations, The Australian among them, have said they were unaware of the comments and Voller did not ask for them to be taken down before launching court action. As News Corp Australia, publisher of this newspaper, has pointed out, mainstream media is being held to account for social media commentary when the platform itself bears no responsibility and does not allow comments to be turned off.
The law has always been a horse-and-buggy left behind by technology, but the stakes for democracy and public interest journalism today are alarmingly high. We have to navigate a tsunami of information — and outright lies — amid a multitude of local and global challenges including a pandemic, riots on the streets of our chief ally, geopolitical sparring with our biggest trading partner, industrial-scale conspiracy online, the galloping collapse of the old business model for journalism, and potentially an economic downturn of a severity that can spark social conflict. The question for political leaders is what law and policy will encourage the creation and sharing of accurate information and analysis that tries to get at the truth. We urgently need recalibration of the incentives to encourage journalists serious about the public’s right to know. By accidents of technology and failures of policy, the public square has become overrun with trolls, bots and bad actors.
Against this background, the legal contortions of the Voller case have an air of unreality. Provisions at issue in a key broadcasting statute were drafted before Facebook existed. Defamation law is already slated for a technology upgrade. And after excruciating delay, the federal government has flagged a mandatory code of conduct and a revenue reckoning for the oligopolistic tech giants, which have expropriated the quality journalism of the mainstream media while disavowing any responsibility for the toxic sprays of anonymous malevolence that pass for debate on its platforms. As we wait for action, more newsrooms close, the ranks of spin doctors grow and increasingly tribalised voters are likely to lose patience with the difficult business of negotiation and trade-offs in democratic politics, as well as losing faith in the tolerance required if civil society is to function.
The tech giants want it every which way but accountable. One day they are private platforms with take-it-or-leave-it dictatorial control over content. The next they are public utilities promising a utopia of ever deeper social connection. But they shrug off any suggestion they are also publishers that should try to prevent their business model poisoning the wells of communication. And they resist the expectation they should be good-faith traders duty-bound to pay for benefiting from journalism created by others.
So many of these themes come together in the flame war between Donald Trump and Twitter. The US President’s account is hardly a reliable news source but Twitter only draws attention to its own unadmitted bias when it invokes CNN as if it were a neutral authority to fact-check Mr Trump’s hyperbolic claims about electoral fraud. Twitter attaches no such “fake news” warnings to Chinese Communist Party-linked accounts spreading propaganda that the coronavirus is all-American, nor to the anti-Semitic rants of Iran’s leader. The tech giants seem oblivious to the distortions of the “progressivist” world view they impose on citizens with a galling lack of transparency. They bear a heavy responsibility for the modern vice in which the progressive take on “hot button” social issues becomes dogma and dissent gets suppressed as “hate speech”. This is dangerous. Without open and honest debate, we risk being overwhelmed by the multitude of problems that confront us as societies.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Foreign bill presents fresh China headache for ALP	The Australian	WeChat gagged him, so the PM must talk up our values to the world
The asymmetrical nature of engagement with China’s one-party communist state underscores why a considered and unified approach is essential and in the national interest. Recent events have shown the extent to which the major developed nations understand the Chinese Communist Party’s bullying ways and are prepared to stand firmly alongside Australia. The CCP’s use of fake and outrageous images on Twitter in an attempt to undermine Australia’s good standing and the refusal to allow Scott Morrison to argue Australia’s case publicly on WeChat provide a low-rent window into what is going on at a much bigger scale. WeChat censored the Prime Minister’s post about the doctored tweet on the grounds it “involves use of content that incites, misleads, has non-objective facts” or “fabricates societal/historical issues”. This is a bit rich given there is no dispute that the image being presented by CCP officials of an Australian soldier behaving illegally in Afghanistan is a fake.
Censorship of WeChat is business as usual for the CCP, which uses the social media platform to monitor and control its citizens in China and abroad. Truth is not a feature of WeChat or the CCP’s propagandist ways. What is abundantly clear is that the misrepresentation of Australia’s open appraisal of its own military operations in Afghanistan is being used by China to prosecute a much bigger agenda. It is part of a broader campaign involving verbal tirades and trade sanctions against a suite of Australian export products including barley, coal and wine.
Australia no doubt has angered Beijing by speaking its mind. But a key objective of the CCP is to warn other nations against joining together to stand against China’s muscular assertion under President Xi Jinping. This is well recognised by the US, Britain and other allies that have spoken out publicly in support of Australia. This makes it all the more surprising that the federal opposition has chosen to play politics domestically with how the China relationship is being managed. After Labor tangled itself up on the issue of how Scott Morrison is managing Australia’s engagement with Beijing, Anthony Albanese attempted to dial things back a notch on Thursday. Declaring Labor was “at one” with the Coalition over a Chinese official’s “disgusting, provocative” tweet, the Opposition Leader said he stood with the government on standing up for Australian values. Asked how Labor would do things differently, Mr Albanese said Australia should find other markets for its exports. Not much new there.
The opposition has been busy digging itself another China hole with its response to the foreign relations bill. The bill was conceived in the wake of the Victorian Labor government’s Belt and Road memorandum of understanding with the CCP and potentially dubious relationships between universities and the Chinese government. It establishes a legislative scheme for commonwealth engagement with arrangements between state or territory governments and foreign governments. The framework ensures that arrangements between state or territory governments and foreign governments, and their associated entities, do not adversely affect Australia’s foreign relations and are consistent with Australia’s foreign policy. Under the legislation, state and territory entities will be prohibited from negotiating or entering an arrangement with a foreign entity if approval from the minister is not in force.
Victorian leader Daniel Andrews has sought to downplay the impact of the bill, characterising it as commonwealth overreach in seeking to monitor sister-city agreements. He is standing firm on Victoria’s Belt and Road Initiative that sparked the legislation. Labor federally has let it be know it supports the bill’s intent. Rather than accepting the bill, however, the Senate added two amendments that have been rejected by the government. One amendment was for an annual report on decisions made under the act. The second was to allow for judicial oversight of decisions made to stop international agreements. The bill is being sent back to the Senate, where Labor is expected to drop the amendments and let it proceed.
Recent events show the wisdom of having mechanisms in place to ensure that Australian governments are on the same page when it comes to relations with the CCP. Creating and then exploiting division to gain power and influence is as old as human relations. Australia has a rich vein of international support because it is honest and prepared to speak its mind. Joe Biden’s designated national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, tweeted on Thursday that the US under the new president would “stand shoulder to shoulder” with Australia. He said the Australian people had made great sacrifices to protect freedom and democracy around the world and the US would rally fellow democracies to advance our shared security, prosperity and values. Australia can feel secure in the level of international support that it has received. Despite the CCP-driven WeChat setback, the government must continue to reach out to the Chinese citizens in China and domestically. If there is a dispute, it is not with the people of China or those of Chinese origin who chose to call Australia home.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Welcome to our revamped Coastal News. It’s jam-packed with l [... ] [Derived headline ]	Bay of Plenty Times	Welcome to our revamped Coastal News. It’s jam-packed with local news and regular features that we will publish weekly from now on.
Among these features is a dedicated puzzles page which I’m excited that we’re providing. It’s good for your brain.
I found an article by Dr Malvindar Singh-Bains, a research fellow at the Centre for Brain Research, who reminds us that we must look after this precious organ. Use it or lose it is key — and puzzles are a fun and proven way to do that.
Dr Singh-Bains says we need a “multi-component lifestyle” to keep our brains as healthy as we possibly can. That sounds like the lifestyle of a lot of people that I know.
Physical activity (30 minutes a day at least five times a week), cognitive stimulation (Sudoku puzzles, chess, reading books and newspapers), social activities (friends, family, community groups), good sleep and good management of cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, obesity, smoking and hypertension) are all in the recipe.
Brain training, heart training and body training are what’s recommended, and your local Coastal News has inspiration on all of these.
We have a new look for the property section of Coastal News to showcase vendor properties. Our dedicated section for the Paradise Coast Property Guide will give agents the ability to showcase one of the amazing Paradise Coast properties on the market every week. We hope you like these changes.
One thing we won’t be changing is our focus on local news. From Whitianga to Whiritoa and all communities in between, we’re happy to share news of what’s happening.

EDITORIAL Thank you all, and stay safe	The Daily Post	Well I know it’s hardly original to say this, but what a funny old year 2020’s been. From our first-ever experience of lockdown to the occasional community outbreak scares in late winter and spring, to the impact of job losses, the stress of Covid “pivots”, home-schooling and home working, the impact on local economies and the wider country generally ... it’s like nothing any of us has ever experienced before.
So it’s with a great sense of relief that many of us are hanging out for a break over the Christmas/New Year period, for those of us lucky enough to get one. This edition of the Taupo & Turangi Weekender is our special annual summer visitor guide, This Is Lake Taupo, and we hope in its pages you’ll find some events to enjoy, some new places to go, some adventures to try and some suggestions for keeping yourselves and the kids occupied. Or, you can just choose to find a shady spot under a tree at a local park, read a book, dip your toes in the lake and enjoy doing nothing for a few days, which is exactly what I intend to do while I recover from the Christmas rush.
For those of you who are working through, who keep our shops and cafes open, our hospitals and medical services running, keep our streets and roads safe, the water and the power on, and the rubbish and recycling collected, thank you.
I sincerely hope you will get a turn for some time out as soon as you can.
To our visitors, nau mai, haere mai, welcome to our beautiful district. Please explore the many gems Turangi and Taupo have to offer. Our tourism operators and retailers appreciate your support and the vibrancy you bring to our district.
To our readers and advertisers, thank you for your support this year, it has meant a great deal and allowed us to get our paper back up and running after Covid-19 so we can continue bringing you news from around the Taupo district.
To all, I wish you a safe and peaceful Christmas and a pleasant New Year. Wash your hands, use the Covid-19 Tracer app, stay home if you’re sick and let’s all work together to keep it a Covid-free summer so that we can enjoy it.

Securing economic revival has become more difficult	The Australian	We’ll need confidence and incentives to hire, expand, invest
In the early phase of pandemic-induced economic shutdown, the Morrison government adopted a “whatever it takes” approach to splashing taxpayer funds on welfare to save businesses and jobs. Income support measures, such as the JobKeeper wage subsidy and a coronavirus supplement, had the virtue of being temporary, targeted, seemingly proportionate and delivered through established payment channels. In late March, the number of COVID-19 cases was rising by more than 20 per cent a day; Treasury was contemplating a fall in gross domestic product of more than 20 per cent in the June quarter. In the urgency to act, size mattered, and so did simplicity; best practice or tried and tested policy took a back seat. At the time, the anticipated cost of tax breaks, income support, loan guarantees, free childcare and the like came to an eye-watering $320bn, or one-sixth the size of the entire economy. We argued this “neo-Whitlamist fiscal freak show” could not become the new normal.
In many respects that was a simpler time: putting businesses in hibernation, easing rules on welfare eligibility and anticipating an economic snapback. The idea was to get as much spending into the economy as possible in the shortest time. Four months on, the economy is better than anticipated, with a clawback of 210,000 jobs last month. The drop in GDP won’t be anywhere near the worst-case official forecasts. Yet the latest infection outbreaks in Victoria and NSW have dented confidence; borders are closed, our second-largest economy is in isolation and further restrictions loom. In any case, the Morrison government is reining in individual income support by $300 a fortnight at the end of September, as it promised it would, but also extending payments for another six months. There will be two tiers of JobKeeper based on hours worked, changes in eligibility for employers and a lowering of coronavirus supplement payments. This finetuning will cost the budget $20bn.
In its review of JobKeeper, Treasury found 875,000 part-time workers, or one-quarter of people covered by the $1500-a-fortnight scheme, will get an average fortnightly pay bump of $550. Some of this windfall replaces wages from second jobs or welfare payments. In any case, Treasury said the flat rate blunted incentives for workers to seek more hours as businesses reopened. These disincentives would become more pronounced across time and as the economy recovered, it said. In this vein, more will be asked of the unemployed to search for work. Many receiving payments will be able to earn up to $300 a fortnight without losing the reduced $250 coronavirus supplement. These changes apply until the end of the year, and Scott Morrison signalled higher dole payments would extend into next year, although not to the scale sought by welfare and business groups.
The government hopes by next March only one million will be on the revamped wage subsidy, from 3.5 million now. That puts employers under the pump, but improving work incentives, cutting the fiscal cost and getting businesses to stand on their own feet are higher priorities. The Business Council of Australia sees the creation of two million jobs as a “colossal task”. But it is not impossible. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said on Tuesday the labour market had “turned the corner”. He said the crisis JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments were manageable and affordable, given solid public finances and low interest rates; the debt could be repaid across time. But Dr Lowe slammed the voguish Modern Monetary Theory push to simply “print money”. As we’ve said before, there is no free lunch and a day of reckoning awaits spendthrifts. On Thursday Josh Frydenberg will give us a sense of the government’s running tab, the shape of the October budget and a short-term plan for recovery. It’s predicated on banking the gains from suppression of COVID-19 and continued reopening of commerce. Now that Labor has found its voice on debt and deficits, the Treasurer can no doubt count on opposition support for some of the hard choices he’ll make in the expenditure review committee. More important, however, is getting the price signals right for expansion, hiring and innovation, removing regulatory impediments to projects, making workplaces more flexible and using this moment to upskill workers for jobs of the future. Australia is being remade. The challenge for the government is to enact reforms to take full advantage of our post-pandemic opportunities.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
FROM THE EDITOR’S DESK Time to look at way we treat animals	Wanganui Chronicle	We’ve emerged from the pandemic lockdown.
For most this has been a time of reflection, of reset.
But how quickly we forget. We become self-absorbed, our panic and fear overtake the important lesson of this extraordinary lesson of our lifetime.
I have never experienced this time, as have most of us.
So how are we going to emerge back to normal?
Which brings me to what caused the lockdown. Swine flu, mad cow disease, coronavirus, all take their names from animals. So what are we doing here?
Have we forgotten? The Covid-19 came from the exotic animals trafficked in the wet markets in China. Of course, somewhere else.
This is also about our practices and how we treat and eat animals.
Which brings me to something that is happening within our borders.
During lockdown we had an animal welfare crisis happening; mothering sows in farrowing crates.
Under level 4 lockdown, pigs could not be sent to the abattoir, and a 70kg sow would put on 5kg a week. Therefore she won’t fit into her crate.
Oh, hang on a moment. A sow in a crate? They should not be in crates but allowed to roam freely and graze on the land.
Television viewing one night was refreshing, promising even, for that reflection and reset.
Regenerative farming. I watched with bated breath that regenerative farming was becoming a mainstream practice in line with what I know, the whole Earth design of permaculture, working with nature, not against.
Peter Barrett on Linnburn Farm in the Maniatoto, Otago, is doing just that.
Working with nature with healthy soil as their focus. Planting 60 different kinds of feed for his herd and allowing them to self medicate from all the plants. Peter says good soil results in healthy animals who result in healthy people.
For those people who eat meat, do they know where it came from, and do they wonder what the animal they are eating, has endured?
We have a 2015 law in this country, where animals were given sentient being status. But I’ve said this previously; what is the definition of a sentient animal under this law?

What a buzz this week to interview Sergeant Dean Hart who br [... ] [Derived headline ]	Bay of Plenty Times	What a buzz this week to interview Sergeant Dean Hart who broke the New Zealand land speed record on the weekend in a jet-fuelled dragster that he built himself.
Hearing his story of growing up as a kid in Whangamatā with access to scrap metal and guys willing to weld for him from their back sheds made me reflect on being Kiwi. That inventive, curious attitude and the ability to relate to and seek help from older people with skills is what struck me about Dean’s story and about life in our small towns.
Dean looked skyward at the P3 Orions as they occasionally flew over and dreamt of something bigger.
It meant he had to leave his hometown to serve in the Air Force but it’s a life of adventure.
Dean is ‘flying the desk’ currently in Whenuapai, which suits his life as a new dad, and he’s been able to visit his family and influential older people back home in Whanga, following his incredible achievement on the weekend.
We have many skilled retirees in our community and those that encourage youngsters and others willing to learn from them in movements like the Whangamatā Menz Shed — which also welcomes women — are just brilliant.
As for access to scrap, a while ago I recall talk in all three townships of Whangamatā, Tairua and Pāuanui about setting up reuse centres like the excellent Seagull Centre that operates in Thames.
We have a costly problem with the mountains of “recycled” packaging no longer being taken by China and the impact on our rates is being felt this year. For too long we have perhaps relied on waste management contract companies to conveniently make the problem go away, and ignored our responsibilities as consumers to consider the life cycle of the products we use.
There is a massive opportunity for inventive minds to see solutions in this waste. We might have to become more resourceful as a community as we face the uncertainty of the coronavirus and realise the fragility of our focus on international tourism and access to raw materials and ingredients from overseas.
Inventive and creative minds are forever a strength in the world.
If you’re looking for inspiration in Whangamatā — home of the Beach Hop — look to an old boy who designed, built and drove the country’s fastest car on land, using scrap. Bravo Dean!

University chiefs at a discount	The Australian	What higher education needs is some fresh ideas and bold leadership
Like property prices, the salaries of vice-chancellors don’t always go up. As this newspaper reported on Monday, our oldest university, the University of Sydney, will pay its incoming chief, Mark Scott, 40 per cent less than the outgoing Michael Spence, who had pulled a staggering $1.6m. For that money you get almost three prime ministers.
Other institutions, including the University of Adelaide and the Australian Catholic University, are also offering new leaders less money, just as not long ago they were chasing one another’s salaries ever upwards. Now, because of COVID-19 and chilly relations with Beijing, the multibillion-dollar international student business — with China as the No 1 market — has turned sour. It would be odd if those in charge didn’t share the pain. But the pandemic pay cut is to be short-lived for the vice-chancellors of the University of Melbourne and Monash, who are to return to their 2019 salaries of $1.3m. Overseas student revenue won’t return so easily.
The salaries of vice-chancellors were hard to justify even when things were going swimmingly. It’s true our universities are unusually large by international standards, and the fee-paying student business was a global commercial operation, but the level of vice-chancellors’ pay was not obviously linked to performance. There were good reasons for getting more corporate expertise onto university governing bodies, but the parallel between higher education and the corporate world only goes so far. Shareholders exert more discipline on management, whereas university councils tend to have cosy relations with vice-chancellors and engage in artificial benchmarking of salaries, which reinforces each other’s sense of prestige and helps justify the large amounts of money paid to executives just below the chief in the ever-expanding university bureaucracy.
A widening gulf between worker-academics and university managers also causes consternation in the UK but it is more extreme here in Australia. A key reason for discontent is that the contemporary university glories in the research that promotes itself in the international rankings, important for attracting fee-paying overseas students, while so much of the core activity of teaching both locals and visitors is carried out by modestly paid casual academics.
Now there is a big question mark over this model. Universities were warned about their over-dependence on an international student market so heavily weighted towards China as a source country. If vice-chancellors were being compensated for their far-sighted strategy, how did their institutions end up in this predicament, and what are their ideas for a way out? Steven Schwartz, who apart from running universities here and in the UK has also advised on higher education policy, seems pessimistic. On Monday, he tweeted: “Australian universities lobby the government for the return of international students. There is no Plan B. Like members of a cargo cult, vice-chancellors gather on the shore waiting for their salvation to wash from the sea.” Maybe there’s a better effort coming. Mark Scott’s appointment at Sydney is noteworthy because he is not an academic but an administrator. He runs the NSW Department of Education, was managing director of the ABC and has a past as a journalist. RMIT’s outgoing vice-chancellor, Martin Bean, has a similarly non-traditional background, his being in technology companies. Experiments like these are rare, and it’s a good thing if the current financial shock inspires some new leadership strategies and genuinely different university missions. COVID may be on the wane, and it’s even possible relations with China may thaw a little, but there are plenty of other challenges for higher education, technology-driven competition being one. A first-among-equals scholar with a brilliant research record in some area of micro-specialisation is not necessarily the crafty and ingenious administrator who can make a university prosper in these tough times.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
Our View Washing is a dirty chore	Wanganui Chronicle	When it comes to microplastics, it appears the issue really does come out in the wash.
Recent research (undertaken by Scion, the University of Canterbury, Auckland Council and Watercare, and funded by the Ministry for the Environment and Packaging NZ) has shown the tiny fibres released when washing our clothes are causing the single biggest microplastic pollution in Auckland’s waterways.
Globally, it’s estimated eight million tonnes of plastics now enter the sea each year. The United Nations has likened the impacts of microplastic pollution to the issues of climate change.
While microbeads in body washes have been one of the most recent demons spotlighted, there has been increasing global research into the impact of synthetic fabrics in waterways.
Among other things, recent US and UK research has found synthetic fleece jackets — which can be made from polyester, recycled plastic bottles and petroleum — release 1.7g of microfibres each wash — and older jackets shed almost twice as many fibres as new ones. Top-loading washing machines apparently release about seven times more than front-loaders. And, seemingly counter-intuitively, washing clothes on a delicate cycle releases far more microfibres.
The NZ researchers say their latest findings reveal the scale of the problem. They found 88 per cent of the microparticles were fibres, most the common plastics polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene — and said the washing of clothing and textiles was the likely cause.
It is a material blow, particularly for those thinking they are doing right by the environment in finding ways to support the reuse of plastic in clothing.
The findings will likely also present a poser for staunch vegans avoiding animal products such as wool or leather. And, given polyester, lycra, and nylon are often far cheaper and more accessible than natural cotton and wool, any major changes to clothing manufacturing and retailing as a result could mean yet another cost likely felt more by those less able to bear it.
But given these plastic particles are ending up in landfills, washing into waterways, and entering the food chain where they have been linked with all sorts of adverse health effects, it is a problem for all.
The NZ researchers suggested various solutions: Most obviously reducing the use of plastics in clothing, introducing alternatives such as marine-degradable plastics, or removing the microparticles before they enter the water — through better filters in washing machines and wastewater treatment plants.
In the meantime, as individuals, if we are able to, we can invest in clothing and textiles made from natural fibres. We could also wash our clothes less often, if possible. Natural fibres wear well and can smell fresher for longer. Plus, we’d not only be preventing more microplastics entering waterways, we’d be reducing our water consumption and saving on washing powder and electricity, too.
It’s time to turn the tide on what’s washing out of our clothes and what’s washing up on our beaches and plates. It’s certainly long past the time when we can plead ignorance about a major pollutant all of our own making.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Our View Latest plastic demon up to dirty work as we do washing	The New Zealand Herald	When it comes to microplastics, it appears the issue really does come out in the wash.

FROM THE EDITOR Are we paying for too many tourists?	Bay of Plenty Times	Whether it’s public toilets at Onemana or a boardwalk on dunes at Whangamatā, the needs of the visitor — or creation of a so-called ‘visitor experience’ — is a debate we locals need to have. We’re not the only ones.
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment Simon Upton’s new report, Pristine, popular… imperilled? warns that domestic and international tourists are putting too much pressure on our environment.
Local Government New Zealand president Dave Cull says his report is on the money. He says central government has done a great job of marketing New Zealand’s prime tourism destinations, particularly to international visitors, but have literally passed the buck when it comes to funding the infrastructure and managing the very real impacts that local communities see on the ground.
The Commissioner wants to see New Zealand focus on high-value rather than high-pressure tourism.
“The Commissioner is right to ask whether we’re in danger of killing the goose that laid the golden egg.”
LGNZ’s president is calling for “real, sustained” investment into infrastructure to support the industry and protect the environment, not just grants and contestable funding.
Onemana’s community plan states they do not wish for any more freedom campers in their settlement.
TCDC’s application for Government money catering to tourists is dated prior to meetings about the design and location of the toilets.
Locals never asked for the freedom campers and don’t want the toilet there — regardless of who’s paying.

FROM THE EDITOR Good trustees are important	Wanganui Chronicle	While I have always preferred English over maths, I do have at least a basic understanding of numbers. I know my Pythagoras from my pi and I know what a percentage is.
So while I might not be able to solve the Riemann Hypothesis, I do know that 32.3 per cent is not exactly a high success rate.
In fact, it’s a pretty dismal number. Especially when you realise it is the percentage of eligible voters who bothered to vote in the last Taranaki Electricity Trust (TET) Election three years ago.
Just 6124 people, of an eligible 18,939, bothered to have a say in who should make funding decisions.
And 32.3 per cent is a very low number.
You know what isn’t a low number - $98,800,000. That’s just 1.2 million shy of $100 million. That is the total amount given out in grants by the TET since its inception in 1993.
In the last financial year alone, TET trustees handed out a total of $2,568,431 to community groups, organisations and local individuals through 164 grants.
You don’t have to know your Pythagoras to know that’s a whole lot of cash.
It’s cash that those groups and individuals haven’t had to find elsewhere. They haven’t had to charge higher ticket prices for shows, increase entry fees to events, knock on your door asking you to buy bars of chocolate, or in the case of some council projects - had to increase your rates further.
Some of the things funded by the TET are big ticket items - a grant of $600,000 towards the new Stratford St John facility for example or the $1.8m granted to Waitara’s multi-sports facility at Clifton Park, while other grants can be for as little as one or two hundred dollars.
Big or little in dollar amounts, there is no question every grant makes a real difference to the recipients and often to the wider community.
Take the $570,000 granted over the past three years to Tūtaki Youth Inc in Stratford. That money goes directly to funding social work in the community, along with a range of programmes targeted at reducing family harm incidents and building better outcomes for the area’s young people.
Or how about the $2m lent to the new hospital wing at Marinoto in Inglewood? Another project that possibly would not exist without the TET’s support.
The same can be said for many of the projects the TET funds. Without TET funding there are some projects that simply will not get off the ground. If you want things like new swimming pools or children’s bike parks in your community, you need trustees on the TET board who you believe will make wise decisions on funding these projects and the many more that will come through the years.
Every three years you get to have your say on who those trustees will be. You are asked to vote for the three representatives of the ward you live in who you think will look after, invest and distribute the TET money wisely.
Some of that money goes to salaries for the trustees themselves.
In the year ending June 2019, a total of $153,915 was paid in trustee renumeration for the trustees.
That money is distributed between the six trustees with the chair and vice chair receiving slightly more than the other trustees.
There is no question that whoever is voted in will need to work hard for that money. As well as the monthly meetings to make decisions on grants, there are countless hours involved in doing their due diligence on each application, talking to people, visiting places and finding out information.
A good trustee won’t just show up to a meeting once a month, they will be out in their community all the time, listening, supporting and advising to ensure the money they look after is being well spent. They are the ones doing the hard work there, all you have to do is vote.
So take a moment tonight to get out the voting document and fill it in.
Have your say in who looks after the multimillion-dollar fund our community is so fortunate to have, and let’s see the numbers grow.
Not just the number of dollars to be invested and used wisely, but also the number of people who actually bother to vote for the trustees who administer it.
The TET election closes at noon, Friday, June 12. Completed voting documents must have been returned by then.
They can be returned by post, or hand delivered to the Taranaki Electricity, 84 Rata St, Inglewood on Wednesdays and Fridays between 9.30am and 12.30pm during the voting period.

COVID-19 disaster to our north	The Australian	While Western nations are stretched, Indonesia needs help
Grim forecasts by the University of Indonesia of more than 120,000 coronavirus deaths by the end of May leave no doubt about the depth of the crisis confronting our northern neighbour as it battles the onslaught of the pandemic. While official figures claim just 3842 confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far, with 327 deaths, the university’s research suggests more than one million of the archipelago’s 270 million people have been infected. The looming disaster facing Indonesia could have far-reaching strategic implications for our region.
Jakarta correspondent Amanda Hodge reported on Saturday, “there are rising fears the COVID-19 health crisis could also cascade into an economic and security crisis”. Indonesia Australia Institute director Ross Taylor spoke of a situation in which “apart from losing potentially hundreds of thousands of people, there is also the possibility of social instability because of mass unemployment and people falling back into poverty”. Australia, Mr Taylor warned, could “end up with an absolute catastrophe on our doorstep”.
Such concerns reflect those of two of our most experienced former ambassadors to Jakarta, John McCarthy and Bill Farmer. Indonesia’s stability could be put at risk by the pandemic and its impact on the Indonesian economy, they warned last week, with nationalist and Islamist elements poised to take advantage of any signs of weakness or economic paralysis in the Jakarta government.
The sudden return home of Australia’s Jakarta ambassador, Gary Quinlan, over fears about Indonesia’s capacity to deal with the pandemic, reflects Australian concerns. Indonesia, which was slow to begin testing, has just 8158 ventilators for its 270 million people. It has just two ICU beds for every 100,000 people, and four doctors for every 10,000 people. And 26 doctors and nine nurses have already died from COVID-19 due to an acute shortage of personal protective equipment.
Australia has long been at the forefront of helping Indonesia in troubled times. That was evident in the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, and the 2008 global financial crisis. While our capacity is inevitably constrained by the overwhelming pressures of dealing with the pandemic here, Australia should help ensure it is better equipped. As Hodge wrote, an unstable Indonesia devastated by coronavirus would be “clearly disastrous … should its health crisis spill over into a financial one — as the World Bank recently predicted — years of work building up effective partnerships against terrorism, people-smuggling, transnational and cyber crime could be at risk”.China has sent a planeload of medical aid to Jakarta. Other countries, as well as Australia, must be prepared to assist. The US, despite its challenges, as well as Singapore, South Korea and Japan all share a stake in ensuring the world’s fourth-most populous nation weathers the storm and remains stable.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses

Top produce needs new outlets	The Australian	While capricious, China has been a good trading partner As our economy begins recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, the suggestion that on Friday China will halt imports from Australia worth more than $6bn a year is grave news for a range of industries and their staff. On Tuesday, China’s Ministry of Commerce dismissed reports of bans on Australian wine, lobster, copper, sugar, barley, timber and coal as rumours. But the hold-up of wines headed for the Shanghai trade show and the spoiling of $2m worth of live Australian rock lobsters at Shanghai Airport were signs of possible trouble afoot. At various times, cotton and beef also have been caught in the tensions. As Trade Minister Simon Birmingham says, the inconsistent messages from China are undermining statements by President Xi Jinping at the China International Import Expo. “If China is to be true to the statements of its government, then it should provide confidence that normal Customs and related processes will apply to imports of goods such as seafood and wine,” Senator Birmingham said.
The refusal of Chinese Communist Party ministers to take calls from their counterparts in Australia is a bad breach of protocol. The situation leaves Australia with three options worth pursuing. First, we must continue to protect our core national interests, such as keeping our 5G network and institutions secure from foreign penetration. And the shipping lanes of the South China Sea must remain open. Scott Morrison was correct to call for an international inquiry into the genesis of COVID-19 in Wuhan.
Second, government and industry must diversify our export markets. And third, the Morrison government must keep the door open to China, however strained the relationship is at present. It has been good for both nations for decades. And it may become so again. Australia is a reliable exporter of quality produce. We play fair with our trading partners and we are entitled to expect that others do the same.
We need to be realistic, however. Australia should not delude itself that China will always need our biggest export commodity, iron ore. Beijing is developing iron ore mines in Africa and pioneering a new fleet of supertankers to make it more economic to transport iron ore from Brazil. In the growing Indo-Pacific region, Australia is well placed to diversify our trading relationships. Last year, Australia’s two-way goods and services trade with Indonesia made it our 13th largest trade partner, leaving room for expansion. As regional nations grow, their demand for quality food and wine will increase. A Minerals Council report noted last week that thermal coal exports to the Asia-Pacific region will surge in the next decade. Demand from India, Vietnam and the Philippines is set to deliver long-term economic lifelines for central Queensland and the Hunter Valley in NSW. We can never again afford the red tape and green lawfare that held up the Adani mine for nine years. Trade is our lifeblood.	7	colleges universities; murders murder; murder attempts
China’s tweet tests nation’s resolve in grey war zone	The Australian	While seeking to divide opinion, the slur united our open society
The cliche about a week being a long time in politics has taken on dramatic salience during the past few days. A week ago Scott Morrison attempted to pour oil on troubled waters in our relations with China through a nuanced address to the Policy Exchange in London. The Prime Minister reassured Beijing that Australia did not view China purely through the lens of our deep alliance with the US. In carefully chosen language, Mr Morrison moved to reopen dialogue with Beijing. He rejected the binary choice, often mentioned by commentators claiming inherent tensions between our alliance with the US and our lucrative trading arrangements with China. As Mr Morrison said: “Our actions are wrongly seen and interpreted by some only through the lens of the strategic competition between China and the United States.” The Prime Minister made it clear that while Australian sovereignty and values were not negotiable, “greater latitude will be required from the world’s largest powers to accommodate the individual interests of their partners and allies”. There were hints Beijing might have heeded Mr Morrison’s conciliatory language, with one Chinese agency describing it as an olive branch.
But that was a week ago — an age in geo-strategic terms. The relationship is now openly and dangerously hostile. The reprehensible use of Twitter by one of Beijing’s so-called wolf-warrior diplomats, Zhao Lijian, to smear the Australian Defence Force as murderers was highly provocative. It offered a stark insight into the character of China under Xi Jinping and into the ominous new strategic era in which tensions unfold in a grey zone between peace and war.
Earlier this year Mr Morrison revealed cyber attacks on Australian infrastructure by a sophisticated state actor. The consensus among strategic analysts was, of the handful of states with the capability to conduct such operations, the likeliest culprit was China. The litany of China’s attempts to coerce Australia lengthens each week. Wine exporters have been hit with punitive tariffs. Before them it was barley producers. One of our most respected diplomatic and intelligence leaders, Dennis Richardson, sounded a warning to the Minerals Council of Australia on November 9 when he predicted: “We are going to be in the doghouse, I think, for a good two to three years.” While echoing Mr Morrison’s insistence that Australia must adhere to its core liberal democratic values, Mr Richardson asserted that our China policy had been undermined by parochial partisan sniping inside Australia. The strategic climate to which he was referring has been radically altered by Beijing’s latest conduct.
Totalitarian states present a paradox. They crush internal dissent because they are terrified of their own population. Chinese citizens have no access to Twitter, so loved by their leadership cabal. These states use social media purely to destabilise Western democracies. They view the fault lines in our open societies as a weakness to exploit. Yet they are terrified that such open debate and exchange of ideas is so powerful that it could undermine their own grip on power.
Australia must handle this crisis with every element of soft and hard power in its arsenal. It is encouraging that our Five Eyes intelligence partners responded swiftly in condemning China’s grotesque, ham-fisted cyber attack. Tough-minded pragmatism needs to prevail, as Paul Dibb wrote on Tuesday. Professor Dibb, who was the architect of Australian defence policy during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, injected hard-headed realism into this debate. The Soviet Union, as he wrote, was a more potent threat at the zenith of its power than China is today. Yet we overestimated the Soviet Union and failed to understand the weakness of its economic system. Australia, as he said, must deepen its strategic policy expertise about China. Direct military threats, he argued, might materialise without the warning time presumed in much of our defence planning since the Vietnam War.
Regarding the offensive tweet about our troops as grey zone warfare is not alarmist. With the spectrum of conflict expanding to include the domains of outer space and the electromagnetic spectrum, it is vital that our defence capabilities be upgraded rapidly to allow us to defeat threats emanating from those domains. The package Mr Morrison announced on July 1 is an appropriate response to this reality. We must continue to refine the sophistication of our diplomatic and aid initiatives, especially in this region. We can even draw some comfort from this episode. It has united Australians in revulsion at China’s overreach. The emerging giant has shown its feet of clay. It is alienating nations all over the globe. We must remain open to dialogue with this revisionist power. But, while our produce is for sale, our sovereignty is not.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
FROM THE EDITOR	Bay of Plenty Times	Who’s up for some rock and roll?
This upcoming week is going to be a great one for Waihi, which kicks off the Repco Beach Hop festivities with the Warm Up party on Wednesday.
We all deserve a good knees up after the year we’ve had — and thanks to all the volunteers that make the warm up party happen, that’s exactly what we’re in for.
The Rock n Roll clubs and the classic car enthusiasts are on their way, and while organiser Noddy Watts says he’s not sure exactly how many will make it to the Coromandel this year, he’s reminding anyone who feels unwell to stay home, and the rest of us to practice all the usual Government advice we’ve become so familiar with over Covid-19 when it comes to hygiene and distancing.
After so many months of keeping ourselves to small bubbles, there’s a surprising amount on offer in these last two months of the year.
Our own local Shona Laing will play at Waihi Beach Hotel on December 5, there’s Santa parades in towns everywhere and running events in Pauanui and Waihi coming up. See our What’s On listings and be sure to let us know if you’d like to feature.
But first, let’s get our dancing shoes on for the Repco Beach Hop!

Babies a bonus for small nations	The Australian	Willingness to have more children reflects optimism in the future Sixteen years after issuing his catchphrase, “have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country’’, in launching the Howard government’s $3000 baby bonus, Peter Costello’s call for the Morrison government to encourage Australians to again add to their families is timely. COVID-19 has all but stopped immigration in its tracks, for now. Australia is struggling with skills and labour shortages in fields such as nursing, aged care and engineering and construction. While immigration, post-COVID, would provide a quick solution to such shortages, Mr Costello is demonstrating some admirably long-term thinking, looking decades ahead.
As he said on Monday, population growth for its own sake would not improve the nation’s standard of living. But boosting the birthrate, which has fallen to 1.65 babies per woman, or at least stemming its decline, is a critical counter to the nation’s ageing demographic. He is arguing for a younger Australia rather than a Big Australia.
Emerging pressures in the aged-care sector, considered in the context of Treasury’s Intergenerational Reports, launched by Mr Costello in 2002, make a compelling case for the nation’s couples to have more children. In 1975, there were seven working Australians for every person over the age of 65. By 2050, there are likely to be 2.7 workers supporting every retiree. By 2047, a quarter of our population is likely to be over 65. Even with today’s tax base, government and taxpayers are struggling to keep up with the growing demands of the aged-care sector. Last month, the Morrison government’s Population Statement forecast the nation would have 1.1 million fewer people by 2031 than it would have without the impact of COVID-19. The population would also be older, it said.
On Tuesday, former NSW premier Bob Carr said the Australian economy was too dependent on population growth and argued for a smarter approach that would focus on productivity. We certainly need productivity growth, and government, business and unions need to use the opportunity afforded by COVID-19 to agree on sensible reforms. But Mr Carr, a patron of Sustainable Population Australia, which advocates for controls on the ­nation’s population growth for the sake of the environment and quality of life, is overlooking the advantages of natural population increase. These include building demand, new opportunities and confidence.
As premier, Mr Carr overlooked the potential for growth in Sydney when he declared it “full’’ in 2000 when it had about 4 million people. It is now close to 5 million, and is stronger and more prosperous than ever. Backing natural population increase and immigration with infrastructure is the key to sustaining a larger population and building on its advantages. Declaring Sydney “full’’, unfortunately, prompted Mr Carr’s and subsequent Labor governments to slow the expansion of the city’s transport infrastructure. The Coalition has reversed the trend; but catching up with the city’s needs is a long, slow process. Expanding water infrastructure is also essential and no Australian capital city has had the benefit of a major new dam for decades. As the La Nina weather pattern brings heavy rain during summer, too much of it, as usual, will drain away and pour into the ocean, leaving cities and the land ill-prepared for the inevitable drought years that will follow. Treasury’s next intergenerational report, postponed until next year’s budget, will refocus attention on demographics. Since the mid-1970s, the number of births per Australian woman has been below the rate of 2.1 needed for a steady population. The baby bonus was frowned upon by fiscal purists and others as “middle-class welfare’’. But the payment, and the focus on the importance of building up the population, drove a marked rise in the nation’s fertility rate, which topped out at 2.02 babies per woman in 2008 — a trend labelled the “Costello hump”. Josh Frydenberg has alternatives to another “baby bonus’’. But the conversation is one the nation needs to have. Demographics is destiny.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
More to China than business	The Australian	Willox offers a more realistic and sophisticated view of trade Industry group leader Innes Willox has added a welcome voice of reason to how business and government should relate in the face of continued provocations from our biggest trading partner, China. As a former adviser and chief of staff to long-serving foreign minister Alexander Downer, Mr Willox has the depth of experience needed to know where commerce stops and issues of sovereignty begin. Unlike some of his commercial colleagues, who want Canberra to back down, Mr Willox says government efforts should be focused on helping to open new trade opportunities rather than seeking to appease escalating demands from Beijing.
Canberra must work to keep lines of communication open with the Chinese Communist Party leadership but also use its diplomatic assets to help open the door for business in the world’s other major markets, including India, Latin America and a newly unshackled Britain. With first-hand exposure to the CCP leadership’s past indifference on issues of human rights, Mr Willox says Australia is currently being harassed and bullied to tease out who stands on whose side in the fight for post-pandemic economic and strategic dominance. Willox says while we might not quite be a pawn in the global realignment that is occurring, Australia is certainly being used as a straw man to demonstrate what can happen if you question or stand in the way of the new kid on the global block. This is a much more sophisticated view than one that has been expressed by other industry leaders who argue that government should be willing to compromise to safeguard the nation’s economic interests.
The government has angered Beijing and some local business figures by taking a hard line on foreign investment from Chinese-government backed companies, blocking the takeover of construction and other businesses with strategic contracts and assets. Australia is well within its rights to block foreign government interference, and its actions and policies regarding investment are in line with those of other countries, the US and China included. A list of 14 points of grievance, issued by China, that Australia should address to restore normal relations are beyond sensible consideration. Among complaints are banning Huawei from the rollout of our 5G network, the introduction of foreign interference laws and Australia’s call for an inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 virus. The Chinese Communist Party leadership wants Australia to stop speaking out on sensitive issues such as the South China Sea and allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Seasoned China watcher Rowan Callick has outlined how giving in to China’s demands will lead only to more demands that must be satisfied as a public demonstration of obedience. Canberra must be respectful but prepared to play the long game on normalising relations.
In the meantime, global markets are showing that trade relationships are a two-way street. As we reported on Friday, despite tariffs and bans Australia exported $148bn of goods to China in 2020, the second-highest ever and a fall of only $6bn, or about 4 per cent, from the record level in 2019. Exports were still up almost 10 per cent on 2018, the third-biggest year. Higher prices for iron ore and continued sales of liquefied natural gas blunted the impact of China’s trade bans in other commodities. Expectations are that 2021 will continue to be a bumpy ride both economically and in relations with China. The task for government is to safeguard the nation’s values and insist that global rules are honoured when it comes to trade.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
After economic bounce, the hard work begins now	The Australian	With Victoria open, the nation can get back to business
Confidence is the X-factor in recovery. That is why the Reserve Bank’s brave call that the nation is already out of recession will feed the animal spirits of companies, investors and consumers. On Tuesday, RBA deputy governor Guy Debelle told a Senate estimates hearing that the September quarter was headed for positive growth in gross domestic product. The reopening of the Victorian economy will help to fire up activity in this quarter. And interstate borders must be dismantled as soon as possible, especially for the benefit of the tourism and hospitality sectors. Most Australians feel like a summer holiday, and it’s time to book.
A turnaround in growth, after GDP fell 0.3 per cent in the March ­quarter and 7 per cent in the June quarter, would be testimony to our resilience and underlying economic strength. Wednesday’s inflation data, which showed a 1.6 per cent lift in consumer prices in the three months to September — the fastest quarterly lift since 2006 — added weight to Dr Debelle’s prediction. The CPI result showed the profound changes to how we live and work wrought by the pandemic. Aside from rises in the cost of petrol, childcare and rent, heavy spending on home offices drove a 12 per cent jump in prices for furnishings, household equipment and services. The increase of nine million hours worked in September also augurs well for growth. So does the Commodity Insights report commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia showing that ­demand for thermal coal in a range of Asian countries, including India and Vietnam, will increase by 275 metric tons by 2030. An interest-rate cut to 0.1 per cent from 0.25 per cent when the RBA board meets on Melbourne Cup Day would help fuel what is shaping as an uneven and grinding road out of recession. The looming pressure points that could act as a brake on consumer spending and investment are clear.
Economic recovery is ­expected to be unpredictable and uneven, with rising ­business insolvencies and problems for some households in servicing their debts, as RBA assistant governor Michelle Bullock warned in a speech on financial stability on Tuesday. The true extent of “economic scarring’’ from COVID will be clear only after the JobKeeper subsidy falls from $1200 a fortnight to $1000 in January, and runs out at the end of March. As economic activity gathers pace, the withdrawal of taxpayer-funded support is necessary. And Scott Morrison made it clear in question time on Tuesday that a permanent increase in JobSeeker is likely after the generous coronavirus supplement stops at the end of the year. The withdrawal of government aid, while necessary, will be a blow to the unemployed and those whose jobs will not be coming back post-COVID. The effect on consumer spending will be exacerbated around the same time, as Tom Dusevic wrote, by an increase in mortgage arrears and defaults as banks withdraw loan holidays and landlords begin demanding full rent from tenants.
In his budget, Josh Frydenberg called forth the power of aspiration to oil the wheels of recovery. The focus, Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy told Senate estimates on Monday, is transitioning policy settings from emergency and support measures to policies that promote a strong recovery. But the harder yards of reform, including modernising the industrial relations system, must be addressed. If we are to succeed in manufacturing, a key goal of the Morrison government, the last thing we need are rolling strikes such as those being threatened by the CFMEU against the major egg carton supplier responsible for 70 per cent of the nation’s egg packaging. At a difficult time, the strike could disrupt the supply of eggs to supermarkets, cafes and restaurants. Old-fashioned, 1970s-style industrial confrontation is not in the interests of companies, workers or the wider society. Much will depend on the work of five reform groups considering award simplification, enterprise agreement making, casuals and fixed-term employees, compliance and enforcement, and greenfields agreements. We need a better, more flexible system that is win-win for business and workers by improving productivity. Freeing industry from red tape and providing affordable energy also remain key policy priorities. After recording our first official recession for 29 years, Australia will get off lightly if Dr Debelle’s analysis is right and we emerge from recession when the figures for the September quarter are published in December. But the following two quarters, as support payments end, are also shaping as challenging. Compared with much of the world, which continues to battle COVID second waves, Australia is in a good position. Being an island helps to manage the virus but our economy is not an island. Whatever happens to our trading partners will impact on us. We can take nothing for granted while the pandemic continues to devastate much of the world. Sound policy settings are essential to capitalise on the fact we are bounding out of the blocks after the worst economic shock since the 1930s.	6	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
EDITORIAL Time to be thankful for the rain	Bay of Plenty Times	With all guns blazing I’d hoped this past weekend would be an opportunity to get into the garden at last, but rain chased me out until a Sunday morning session planting native trees with a friend at Hikuai.
We need to be so thankful for this rain.
Up until Queen’s Birthday weekend, drought has impacted people, ecology and livelihoods from Waihi to Whitianga and Mother Nature has a lot of catching up to do.
Niwa meteorologist/forecaster Ben Nolls provided context to the drought and the impact of recent rainfall this week. Niwa’s facebook page is good for reading up on what’s happening with Niwa and their forecasts for the weather.
Our regional councils that ratepayers’ fund are also great to visit.
For example, Waikato Regional Council has automated recorder sites constantly checking on river levels and rainfall around the region.
River flow figures from the Ohinemuri in Karangahake to the Waiwawawa at Rangihau Rd ford in Coroglen, get sent every 15 minutes and updated online every three hours.
If you’re stuck inside due to rainfall, you might like to check these out sometime. And if you’re looking to plant trees yourself this weekend, Paeroa Streamcare are holding a planting bee and sausage sizzle at Aorangi Reserve Paeroa on Sunday 21 June from 1.30 to 3.30pm, finishing with a sausage sizzle.
All welcome. Bring a friend and get ready to plant.

The nation can afford to hasten slowly with vaccines	The Australian	With low Covid-19 numbers in summer, there is time for testing Given high levels of anxiety being encouraged by border closures and bans on public gatherings for New Year’s Eve entertainment in some states, a desire to rush the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine is to be expected. The reality is Australia has been successful in suppressing the virus and medical services are not being challenged by high numbers of patients from the pandemic, despite the outbreak in Sydney’s northern beaches.
Quarantine measures for overseas travellers arriving appear to be working and summer temperatures are helping to keep the spread of the virus in check. Such good fortune does not justify complacency but it puts into perspective the fact that the challenge facing Australian authorities is vastly different to places where the vaccine is being quickly distributed under emergency powers rather than full approval. As of Monday there had been 79.67 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, including 1.76 million deaths reported to the World Health Organisation. Australia has recorded 28,337 cases, with 909 deaths, of which the vast majority were in Victoria because of the Andrews government’s bungled management of hotel quarantine. Emergency hospital facilities set up to cope with a surge of COVID-19 cases have gone largely unused. The task facing government is to preserve the low numbers through good management and effective contact tracing, and to plan for a professional rollout of a vaccination program when it is considered safe and sufficient supplies are available.
Australia has set a timetable to distribute the vaccine starting in March, with universal free cover for those who want it expected to be completed by October. Health Minister Greg Hunt has given a detailed outline of the government’s thinking, which includes a desire to under-promise and over-deliver. Supplies could be available to emergency services and health workers sometime in February. Mr Hunt says Australia is in the fortunate position of having three vaccines at this stage, all of which are on track to being highly effective and safe.
The government has faced some criticism for not securing access to the Pfizer vaccine sooner and for having sufficient supplies to cover only five million people. But, while it is the first vaccine to market, it is not necessarily the most suitable for Australian conditions because of the low temperatures needed for transportation and storage.
One of the elements driving the timing of Australia’s vaccine program is the availability of data from international clinical trials. Final data is expected late next month for the two leading candidates, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer. Once authorities are satisfied with the data they will test the physical stock that is being assembled from international purchases and domestic production. Testing will take 14 days. In some other countries with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, batch testing has not been undertaken, but Mr Hunt says that will not be the case in Australia. After testing, the vaccine will be rolled out to emergency workers and the elderly first.
Australian regulators are confident that both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines will be approved for use within weeks. Oxford-AstraZeneca is achieving good results and progressing well through British, US and European approval processes. Mr Hunt says additional data has been submitted to Australia and a final date for consideration is expected to be late next month or in early February. Domestic production of the vaccine is being undertaken in Australia by CSL. Assessment of the Pfizer vaccine also should be completed next month.
Mr Hunt says the government has accepted the advice of its expert panel on which vaccines, the quantities to use and timetable for delivery. One consideration has been that the Pfizer style of vaccine, an mRNA vaccine, has never been used before. The Oxford-AstraZeneca is a viral vector vaccine, which is better understood. Nonetheless, more than 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine were secured by the government on Christmas Eve. These are expected to cover five million Australians with two shots required for immunity. Another option is a vaccine developed by US company Moderna that also has been approved in the US and Canada. More important than the timing of the rollout is that the public has confidence in the program to get an injection. There have been some adverse reactions to injections in the US and Britain that warrant further attention. Surveys show overwhelming support for a vaccination program. And continued confidence will be key to ensuring a nationwide program is successful. A high take-up rate will be essential to opening state borders and restoring the prospect of international travel. With case numbers low, getting the vaccination program right is more important than getting it done quickly.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
McGowan’s state of disorder	The Australian	With the worst of the pandemic hopefully behind us, and the vaccine rollout well under way, selfish premiers are finding it difficult to surrender their controlling ways. In Western Australia, Mark McGowan is determined to wreck any hopes that national cabinet on Friday can reach a unified and sensible position on how to manage state borders.
Instead, with a state election only weeks away, Mr McGowan is tapping deeply into populist sentiments in the west to keep outsiders out. On Tuesday, Mr McGowan flirted with making border controls imposed to tackle COVID-19 permanent in the name of fighting crime. Travel permits are a hallmark of totalitarian regimes around the world and throughout history. Mr McGowan challenged civil libertarians to block his way before making a humiliating backdown in the face of an angry response from the federal government, the business lobby and constitutional experts.
Similar to Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews’ penchant for extended emergency powers, Mr McGowan’s authoritarian sentiments prove that liberties surrendered by citizens in times of crisis can be difficult to get back. Impeding free movement and restricting trade between states comes at a high cost. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce is leading the charge for a more co-ordinated approach to domestic borders, but Mr McGowan admits he hasn’t bothered to speak with him about it. A recalculation of GST payments to favour Western Australia and booming state receipts from high iron ore prices might give Mr McGowan the fleeting luxury of indifference. But in Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk has surveyed the wreckage caused by her government’s shortsighted border closures on the state’s tourism industry and is working hard to send the bill to Canberra. Ms Palaszczuk’s public spat with Josh Frydenberg amplifies the juvenile antics of her deputy, who has refused to honour a deal with NSW to reimburse the costs of quarantining Queensland residents. Mr Frydenberg has called out Ms Palaszczuk’s actions for the grandstanding and petty politicking they are. It is becoming clear the real damage being done to Australia by COVID-19 is to sensible state government and the federation.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Digging a deep hole on water	The Australian	Without certainty, the politics of drought are fraught
If both levels of government in Queensland needed any more reminders that perception is everything in politics, they were given one in spades this week courtesy of a proposed water mining operation near Warwick in the Darling Downs.
In less fraught times, news that a company wanted to exercise its right granted by the state government to extract up to 96 million litres of water a year from an aquifer deep beneath its Cherrabah Resort and send it for bottling on the Gold Coast might have been unremarkable.
But these are fraught times, particularly for the Southern Downs, a region struggling to cope with a savage drought that has left some towns without any water supply at all, save for what can be trucked in from distant dams, and residents having to cope with restrictions on water use of just 80 litres per person a day. That the company is backed by Chinese investors also riled some critics. But the real issue that has infuriated farmers and landholders in the region is how this water mine could have been approved at all in the middle of an ongoing drought and with many unanswered questions about its impact on their livelihoods.
Successive state governments have seen no problem with granting the company a licence to extract the groundwater. That has left the Southern Downs Regional Council to deal with the company’s development ambitions. Last month it finally approved the water mining venture with strict conditions about upgrading road access. The council and the company are now in negotiations about the conditional approval.But what the company, the council and the government appear to have forgotten are the concerns of small local landholders reliant on bores to water their properties. With millions of litres of water from the aquifer they have used for generations now destined for bottling plants on the Gold Coast, they want some reassurance about their future. So far they remain unsatisfied with the answers they are getting. It is time for all involved in this saga to appreciate how their actions look to the wider world and change their approach.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
Unions speak for just 9 per cent of private sector staff	The Australian	Workplace reforms must be geared to productivity and job creation When Senate crossbenchers vote on the Morrison government’s workplace bill next year their main considerations should be job creation, productivity improvements and economic growth. They would also do well to factor in the quiet revolution that has been unfolding in workplaces. Despite the ACTU purporting to speak on behalf of employees, trade union membership in the private sector has fallen to a ­record low of 9 per cent, a decline of almost 200,000 members in six years, from 12.1 per cent in 2014, as reported on Saturday. While ABS data shows public sector union membership grew from 570,000 to 710,000 workers between 2014 and 2020, public sector membership has also fallen in percentage terms, however, from 39.6 to 36.8 per cent. ACTU secretary Sally McManus declined to comment on what is a long-term trend.
Most private sector employees, like all workers, aspire to better wages and conditions in return for productivity gains. But in voting with their feet, they have shown they prefer not to belong to the trade union movement. They could also be open to workplace reforms. Workers’ responses to the pandemic show many place a premium on flexibility, including the opportunity to work at home. Or as Minter Ellison’s Annette Kimmit told The Australian’s annual Chief Executive Survey: “2020 has seen a fundamental shift in the relationship between employers and employees and a much deeper empathy.’’ That mindset, which is one of the opportunities created by the COVID crisis and the move away from union membership in the private sector, must not be wasted. Workplace reform needs to be a driver of economic recovery over the coming decade as the nation seeks to produce and trade its way out of deficit and debt, improve living standards and cater for the demands of an ageing population. To the credit of the government and Labor, legislation to facilitate the breaking up of the militant CFMEU was passed last week.
In an effort to not waste the opportunity for co-operative reform, the government convened five working groups in May to advise on areas of the industrial relations system that are ripe for reform. These included award simplification; greenfields agreements to make major new projects more attractive to global investors; casual employment, including the provision of a clearer pathway for those working regular shifts to convert to permanent roles if they want to do so; enterprise agreements to help drive productivity gains and real wage growth and compliance, including reducing the risk of wage underpayments. The Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia’s Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2020 is the end product of that process.
The bill will now be subject to a Senate inquiry. One of its strengths, as Business Council chief executive Jennifer Westacott has pointed out, is that the changes to enterprise agreements put “ambition back in agreement making, returning to Hawke and Keating’s original intention of a system that actively encourages employers and their teams to work together to make an enterprise successful and share in higher wages and better conditions”.
That objective will be key to jobs growth. It will also be central to breaking through the hiatus that has impeded industrial relations reform for a decade, since Labor established the Fair Work system. Making progress, as chief executives told our survey, will depend on maintaining the momentum of collaboration that has served Australia well during the pandemic and its aftermath.
As workplace editor Ewin Hannan wrote on Saturday, Attorney-General and Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter appears prepared to dump a contentious section of the bill that would risk some employees being worse off under new agreements. Under proposed changes, the Fair Work Commission would be able to approve enterprise agreements that did not comply with the better-off-overall test by taking into account the views and ­circumstances of parties, COVID-19 impacts and the ­extent of support for the agreement. Ms McManus and one of her predecessors, Bill Kelty, condemned that possibility, with Mr Kelty branding the proposal “repugnant’’.
The Morrison government realises that if it pushes too hard it could bring on a WorkChoices-style political attack going into the next election. Such a campaign would be the last thing the economy needs. Mr Porter’s caution in insisting the bill is “not a ‘take it or leave it’ proposition” is understandable. The government needs to be pragmatic. But nor, in the national economic interest, should it allow the bill to be watered down excessively. It has much to offer business and workers, including more than 90 per cent of workers in the private sector who have opted not to be unionised.	3	climate change; pandemics covid19; employment pandemics
Beijing unleashes gunslingers	The Australian	World needs answers and trust, not fierce cowboy envoys
An independent international inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic would help the world in general, and China in particular. Beijing feels besieged and humiliated, its prestige tarnished. But a mature nation faces its responsibilities, seeks solutions and avoids practices that have caused death, misery and disruption on a vast scale. The world is watching how China responds and expects nothing less than truth and openness, as novel as those things are to an authoritarian command. Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Marise Payne have led calls for an inquiry. The intention is not to humble China or apportion blame but to learn. As the great Confucius advised, there are three paths to wisdom: reflection, which is the noblest; imitation, which is the easiest; and experience, which is the bitterest.
Wuhan has given us a bitter harvest, but Beijing’s envoys are poisoning relations between nations that depend on each other. Chinese ambassador Cheng Jingye has overstepped his role by threatening economic retaliation. He said Beijing could stop tourists and students coming here while consumers would boycott beef and wine products. This is trolling, not diplomacy. Like Senator Payne, we are appalled by “economic coercion” as espoused by Beijing’s loathsome cowboy. Let’s be clear: trade benefits both countries. Invoking a Scottish philosopher, it is not from the benevolence of the Chinese state that we expect our cheap imports but from its regard to its own self-interest. China buys iron ore, coal and gas from us because we are reliable and ship it at the right price. Chinese mothers seek Australian-made infant formula, food, pharmaceuticals and toiletries because experience tells them they are well made and won’t kill you.
Mr Cheng has often unwisely stuck his nose into domestic politics, such as the decision to ban Huawei from the 5G network. Canberra introduced bans on travel from China on February 1. This decisive early move, and subsequent sensible quarantine measures, is a key reason we suppressed the spread of COVID-19. Yet Beijing’s lackey blasted this as “out of proportion”. He and his shotgun-riding deputy, Wang Xining, have junked useful dialogue and relish roles as enforcers, citing reports of abuse of Uighur Muslims in “training camps” as “fake news” and skating over the expulsion of journalists from China. Last November Mr Wang provided our readers with friendly advice: If Aussies really cared about mother nature or cherished human rights, “to start with, study Mandarin”. The freedom these gunslingers have is not open to foreign envoys, in fact anyone, in China.
Yet such indulgences by officials are not confined to Australia. In Paris, the foreign office summoned the Chinese ambassador to express disapproval about his diplomats’ claims France had simply left its older citizens to die. Beijing’s envoys have inflamed Twitter disputes in Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran and Singapore. During the pandemic they have sparred with Brazil’s education minister and trolled officials in Cyprus and Britain. It’s a departure from the nonintervention in the affairs of other states it once prided itself on. We have watched aghast as Beijing has launched a gauche aid and propaganda offensive in nations hit hard by COVID-19, while so-called “wolf warrior” diplomats spread lies about the source of the outbreak. Last year President Xi Jinping demanded his diplomats show a new “fighting spirit”.That’s one way of seeing the grubby campaign of the fierce cowboys, who interpret every move we make in the global sphere as done at the direction of Washington. It’s pathetic and a malign distraction from fundamental issues, such as Beijing’s rampant militarisation and brazen moves in the South China Sea. Myriad forces unleashed by the pandemic will reshape supply chains, trade and strategic policy. Of course, China will feature prominently in our future and the Indo-Pacific. But our best minds are set on reducing China dependency, exploring new frontiers and making the economy more robust and dynamic. Beijing’s secrecy and duplicity on COVID-19, however, leaves the world vulnerable, confused and suspicious — and China in cold, stark isolation. While Mr Cheng shoots from the hip, Beijing is forfeiting a chance to work with partners to restore the trust, order and co-operation that have enabled its epic economic rise.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
Canberra vindicated on inquiry	The Australian	World wants answers, not Beijing’s taunts and power games The joke is on Beijing’s envoy Cheng Jingye after unanimous approval by the WHO’s 194-nation World Health Assembly on Tuesday of an “impartial, independent and comprehensive” evaluation of the international response to coronavirus. Never before in the 72 years since the World Health Organisation was founded has a WHA motion attracted so many co-sponsor signatories — 137. In the early stages of lobbying by Australia and the EU for support for the motion establishing the inquiry at the “earliest appropriate moment”, even countries with particularly close ties to Beijing, including Russia and South Africa, jumped on board. There can be no surprise about that. COVID-19 has devastated nations large and small, with the number of cases at almost five million and nearly 325,000 deaths.
After fighting tooth and nail for weeks against any inquiry, China was isolated at the WHA. Even a personal appearance by President Xi Jinping on Monday didn’t alter the facts: a world shattered by a virus that emerged from Wuhan had turned against Beijing. China’s drive to thwart an inquiry was facing ignominious defeat. So it did a volte-face and signed up with the cosignatories supporting the motion. Yet Mr Cheng and his purblind “Wolf Warrior” colleagues at Beijing’s voluble foreign ministry would have us believe that the motion was “a joke”. No amount of boorish dissembling by Mr Cheng can disguise the reality, as Greg Sheridan concluded, that “Beijing has suffered an acute diplomatic defeat”. Australia, as Scott Morrison repeatedly emphasised, wanted no more than a proper scientific inquiry that would help ensure the world is not faced with a similar pandemic in the future. That the Prime Minister was representing global opinion was clear from the emphatic support for the inquiry proposal, first suggested by us and then adopted by the EU, at the WHA.
It may be, as some have noted, that the motion did not mention China by name, something Washington was keen to see. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian insisted on Wednesday that “the draft resolution is entirely different from what Australia called ‘(an) independent international review’ ”. The inquiry would be “no more than an evaluation of experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-­­co-ordinated health response, rather than an inquiry based on the presumption of guilt targeting a certain country”. Mr Zhao, like Mr Cheng, appears to have no understanding of the process of drafting resolutions at international gatherings. Even the WHO’s China-friendly director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus emphasised in a tweet the inquiry will include but “will not be limited to” the WHO. Significantly, key aspects of the motion include an investigation into the source of the virus and its transfer to humans and the need to enter China to determine the pandemic’s origins. Dr Tedros, as he is known, has a clear responsibility to give effect to the unanimous WHA decision by ensuring an inquiry is established without delay. Foreign Minister Marise Payne has pointed out that there are a number of bodies within the structures of the WHO and outside it, including an independent oversight committee, that could conduct an investigation. The WHA motion fully vindicates the Morrison government’s initiative in seeking to establish the truth about COVID-19. A deeply anxious world has shown it wants answers, not more obfuscation from Beijing.	2	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses
Brutality masquerades as justice	The Australian	Yang Hengjun’s crime was advocating democratic values
Diplomatic sensitivities tend to preclude the use of pejorative terms such as tyranny, oppression and torture. So we simply say this: China’s formal charging of Australian-Chinese writer Yang Hengjun after 14 months’ detention shows the Communist Party’s scant regard for the rights of those it perceives as dissidents. Dr Yang, an Australian citizen since 2002, has been shackled in heavy chains, bound to a stool from 7am to midnight and subjected to intensive interrogation to break him. Australian consular officials report Dr Yang’s cell has been constantly and brightly lit, with no respite, and that he was refused showers for a fortnight at a time, denied letters and messages from family and friends, and allowed to read books only by Chinese President Xi Jinping. He has been forced to swallow up to nine unknown tablets a day Now he has been charged with espionage, a charge he emphatically denies, for which he could face the death penalty. Travelling with his wife, he was detained at Guangzhou airport in January last year en route to a conference in Shanghai from New York, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University. He was taken to an unknown “black prison”, to a subterranean concrete cage.
The timing of the charges is telling. China has moved against Dr Yang under the cover of COVID-19, its accidental legacy to the world, which it is now trying to use to win friends across Europe and Asia by dispensing masks, test kits and medicos to countries with failing health systems. Its supposed goodwill might look a little less insincere if it afforded overseas political prisoners procedural fairness.
As Foreign Minister Marise Payne said yesterday, crises are a time for nations to pull together. But China’s treatment of Dr Yang shows its ruthless disregard for human rights has not improved. Dr Yang’s treatment also sends a clear message to the widespread Chinese diaspora. If they criticise the communist regime and revisit their homeland they do so at their peril.
China’s conduct makes a mockery of the store it says it places on its membership of the UN Human Rights Council — a useless charade of an organisation at best. Dr Yang’s treatment also exposes the hollowness of claims by the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, at a Canberra press conference in December. Dr Yang’s legal rights “are well protected” and his health was “in good condition”, Mr Cheng claimed. China expected Australia to “respect China’s judicial sovereignty”. That demand cannot be taken seriously when Dr Yang has not had access to legal representation.After initially voicing Australia’s deep concerns clearly and loudly, the Morrison government has advocated on Dr Yang’s behalf discreetly, with the aim of giving China a diplomatic “off ramp”. That was prudent. But Australia deserves a more considered response to its representations than that of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which last year “deplored” Senator Payne’s comments, tactful as they were. The official demanded that Australia “stop interfering in the handling of the case by the Chinese side and stop making irresponsible remarks”. While China continues to fail the test of justice, Australia must hold fast to our values, protect our citizens as far as possible and raise the alarm internationally when grave injustices such as this are done to Australians.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
COMMENT Cut the crap on loo paper and panic, be sensible	The Northern Advocate	You may or may not be aware of the open letter microbiologist Siouxsie Wiles wrote to National Party leader Simon Bridges on Wednesday.
She wants him to tone down his criticisms of the Government and its handling of the coronavirus. Basically to stop politicising it and just band together and be more supportive.
She’s upset that he’s objected to the official response from the Government to this outbreak, and she’s disappointed in his comments which she says, are based on anecdotal feedback instead of facts.
But worse than Bridges, in my view, is his Hamilton East MP David Bennett. He was busy telling listeners to a local Hamilton radio station that people “should” be out there bulk buying.
Are you kidding me? This is a time for cool heads and grown-ups, not point-scoring and promoting panic.
He was saying we should be out buying food, we should be stockpiling.
Why? Why on earth would he ignore the official advice of every expert in this wider health situation, every authority figure right up to the Prime Minister who have said remain calm.
All this political point-scoring and focus on the supermarket shelf-emptying habits of Aucklanders is frustrating for those at the coal face of the economic impact of this outbreak.
For small businesses who’re not getting enough information, for rest homes who have been told they’ll be contacted with protocols but have not yet been. For forestry families who are without work and doing it really tough.
One woman, from a forestry family, wrote to me. Her husband is down to three days a week’s work which is hurting the family budget. She says he’s looking down the barrel of whole weeks of no work.
Relocating isn’t an option for them with kids in schools and sports teams, and the expense of moving. Her husband’s seriously considering a job offer to clear burnt bush in Australia for the next few months to get by, which is not ideal for family life but they’re running out of options.
Truck drivers and their companies are hurting too.
There’s a whole lot of other areas politicians could focus on helping, instead of sitting on radio stations suggesting people rush to buy more toilet paper.

Satisfaction for Bali survivors	The Australian	Zulkarnaen’s arrest is a blow to militant jihadists in Southeast Asia The capture by Indonesian police of the last of the Bali bombers after 18 years on the run shows a commendable determination by Jakarta to pursue terrorists until they are caught — however long that takes. It is an attitude Australians welcome. Aris Sumarsono, known as Zulkarnaen, 57, who had a $US5m ($6.6m) Rewards for Justice bounty on his head, was arrested last Thursday by counter-terrorism forces in a raid on a house in East Lampung on Sumatra. The barbarity of his long terrorist record alleged by police leaves no doubt about the importance his capture. It is a crucial development in Indonesia’s long and difficult battle against Islamist extremism. It also demonstrates why Indonesia should move swiftly to bring him to justice before the nation’s courts.
Indonesian police believe that Zulkarnaen, as military commander of al-Qa’ida-linked Jemaah Islamiah, was the key bombmaker behind the Bali bombings on October 12, 2002, that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians. The atrocities affected the lives of many others, both Indonesians and visitors from 21 countries. Police also allege Zulkarnaen played a pivotal role in other terrorist onslaughts. These included the 2003 attack on the JW Marriott hotel in Jakarta that killed 12 people; the 2004 suicide attack outside the Australian embassy in the Indonesian capital that killed nine; and the 2005 bombing in Bali that killed 20 people.
Before that, authorities say, Zulkarnaen masterminded attacks on churches that took place simultaneously across many Indonesian regions during Christmas and New Year’s Eve in 2000, killing 20 people. They also allege that he was the architect behind sectarian conflict between Christians and Muslims in Ambon, the provincial capital of the Molucca Islands, and Poso, a hotbed of Islamic militancy on Sulawesi island, between 1998 and 2000. More than 5000 people died and 500,000 were displaced in Ambon, and more than 1000 were killed in Poso.
Zulkarnaen, trained as a biologist, is reported to have been among the first Indonesian Islamist militants to go to Afghanistan in the 1980s for terrorist training with the Taliban and al-Qa’ida. He was there for seven years at a time when Osama bin Laden and al-Qa’ida held sway in the country. Zulkarnaen went on to become one of al-Qa’ida’s key representatives in Southeast Asia. He headed Camp Saddah, a terrorist training base in the southern Philippines established to train jihadists from across Southeast Asia.
His appointment in 2003 as the hand-picked successor to Hambali, the notorious Islamist militant who was known as “the Osama bin Laden of Southeast Asia”, reflected Zulkarnaen’s central role in driving terror across our region. At the time, Juan Zarate, the US Treasury assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, said the terrorist group led by Zulkarnaen had “demonstrated its wanton desire to kill innocent civilians of every race, religion and creed, and continues to pose a real threat to security in Southeast Asia”.
The fact it took so long for authorities to track down and capture Zulkarnaen is indicative of the extent to which Islamist militancy remains a potent force in Indonesia. Jemaah Islamiah as a terrorist network has been largely decapitated by Indonesian forces with assistance from Australia and the US. But Zulkarnaen’s success in evading arrest for so long may indicate the group retains an extensive support base, capable of brazenly hiding runaway leaders being pursued by anti-terrorism forces. The 18 years it has taken does not diminish the importance of Zulkarnaen’s capture, however, nor the need for Indonesia’s courts to mete out justice to him. This is especially the case as Indonesia is faced with an emerging new potential threat from Islamic State militants returning home — some via terrorist camps in the southern Philippines — following the defeat of the so-called caliphate in Syria.	1	coronaviruses covid19; political campaigns; social networks
DFAT’s timely advice on China	The Australian	‘Hostage diplomacy’ is no way to conduct foreign relations Upgraded travel advice for China from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with its stark warning that Australians could face “arbitrary detention”, is timely in view of Beijing’s increasingly belligerent conduct towards other nations. The warning is warranted given the communist regime’s brazen use of what former US national security adviser John Bolton terms “hostage diplomacy”. China is using blackmail in its efforts to spring Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei’s daughter, Meng Wanzhou, from detention in Canada in return for two Canadians detained on fictional charges in Beijing.
“Wolf warrior” spokesmen in Beijing’s Foreign Ministry doubtless will see DFAT’s warning as another excuse to vilify Australia, as they did with their concocted claim last month about a so-called racial threat to Chinese students in Australia. As the Canadian “hostage” situation and rapidly deteriorating relations between Beijing and London show, Australia is far from alone in its concerns about Beijing threatening the safety of foreigners on its shores.
As Mr Bolton said, the blatant blackmail being applied in an attempt to force Ms Meng’s release personifies “the escalating economic conflict between China and the world’s industrial democracies”. It is a test, he said, of “Western resolve that Beijing (must) honour the rule of law”.
Ms Meng, Huawei’s chief financial officer, was arrested in December 2018. She is awaiting extradition to the US to face fraud charges and accusations relating to the supply of US technology to Iran. Within weeks, Chinese authorities arbitrarily seized and imprisoned two Canadians in China, charging them last month with espionage. They indicated the pair could be released if Ms Meng was returned. Such behaviour is covered in DFAT’s reference to the detention of foreigners for allegedly “endangering national security”. At a time of strained relations, Australians heading to China should heed the warning. That includes those intending to visit or transit through Hong Kong now that Beijing’s draconian security law is in force.
The detention since January last year of Australian-Chinese writer Yang Hengjun shows the Chinese Communist Party’s ruthlessness. So does the arrest of Chinese law professor Xu Zhangrun, who completed his PhD at the University of Melbourne. He is a critic of President Xi Jinping.
Canada also has warned its citizens against non-essential travel to China, referring to “an extreme risk to your personal safety and security”. It has advised Canadians already in China to leave. And now Britain is the target of threats, including a trade boycott, after Boris Johnson indicated he has finally decided to heed Australian and US intelligence advice and remove Huawei from the UK’s 5G network. Mr Johnson said he did not want “potentially hostile state vendors” to “preside over critical domestic infrastructure”, prompting the Chinese ambassador and spokesmen in Beijing to threaten trade boycotts, similar to threats directed at Australia after Scott Morrison called for an inquiry into how the coronavirus started in Wuhan. Britain, too, should refuse to be cowed. Democratic nations must be staunch and united in confronting Beijing’s aggression. DFAT has underlined the fact the communist state is behaving like a rogue regime, deliberately placing itself beyond the rules-based world order. Crucial decisions lie ahead of the Morrison government on fast-tracking the resettlement of Hong Kong people in Australia. It must remain resolute in not capitulating to Beijing’s threats.	5	diplomatic consular; consular services; national security
