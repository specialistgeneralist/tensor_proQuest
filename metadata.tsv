No pressure, Ashleigh, but …	The Australian	42 years since our last Australian champion is a long time Playing in front of the home crowd at the Australian Open can be daunting even for tennis champions. The careers of Pat Cash, Lleyton Hewitt, Pat Rafter and Samantha Stosur, who won slam tournaments overseas but not in Melbourne, attest to that. On Saturday night Ashleigh Barty, 23, from Springfield, west of Brisbane, experienced how good it is to win at home when she defeated Ukrainian teenager Dayana Yastremska to capture the Adelaide 	1	coronaviruses covid19; social networks; demonstrations protests
Testing time as we await the jab	The Australian	A breakout of the UK COVID variant would pose a new threat The detection in Western Australia of another case of the new, more infectious coronavirus variant that has wreaked havoc in the UK underlines the need for all states and territories to enact effective precautions to prevent it escaping into the community from international quarantine hotels. These precautions must cover airline, airport, transport, hotel and medical staff.

Striking a balance on emissions	The Australian	A coherent national energy policy would boost investment Only three countries — Marshall Islands, Suriname and Norway — met last Sunday’s Paris Agreement deadline to lodge new plans to boost action on climate change. Those nations account for 0.1 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, or what China produces in 30 hours. In 2015, 195 countries signed the agreement, so the poor response is disconcerting for UN officials. But like a lot of the fine print in climate policy, what countries put 	2	climate change; national security; environmental policy

Someone should tell the Australian bourse to pull its head in: the market price to earnings ratio is at more than 18 times. Despite the less than bullish outlook for company profits and GDP growth, that won’t happen in a hurry. Frothy markets are being led by the US Federal Reserve’s easy money regime.

Killer who haunted the nation	The Australian	A deadly chapter in our criminal history is not quite closed The monster who has haunted Perth for more than two decades finally has been brought to justice. On Thursday, Bradley Robert Edwards was convicted on two counts of murder but acquitted of a third. His despicable rampage spanned at least eight years, terrifying and transfixing the nation, especially Western Australia. His killing spree bore the hallmarks of sexually depraved predators dramatised in crime fiction. To those whose loved on	2	climate change; national security; environmental policy
Chinese immunity from truth	The Australian	A fake blame game will not foster COVID-19 co-operation The world’s largest economies, the US and China, have a crucial role to play in sorting out the COVID-19 pandemic and its global consequences. But in spreading delusional claims about the origins of the virus, China is undermining the co-operation needed. As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a “prickly” meeting with a senior Chinese diplomat, this is no time to be spreading “disinformation and outlandish rumours” about responsibilit	5	disease transmission; transmission covid19; coronaviruses pandemics
Saving lives and jobs both priorities amid pandemic	The Australian	A few positive signs are emerging in the COVID-19 battle Two-thirds of the nation’s nearly 4000 cases of coronavirus were acquired overseas — a statistic that is guiding governments’ moves to minimise further spread of the disease. With thousands more Australians set to fly in this week, the risks of them spreading the disease underline the importance of quarantining all overseas arrivals in city hotels for 14 days, cut off from family, friends and the community.

EDITORIAL Level 2 — towards a safer ‘normal’	The Northern Advocate	A fortnight ago, New Zealanders were waking up to the prospect of their last weekend in alert level 4 “lockdown” as the Government considered dropping the country to alert level 3. After two weeks at that “restricted” contact level, we are now tantalisingly close to level 2 — the “reduced” contact phase, whereby the disease is considered contained, although the risk of community transmission remains. There is perhaps even more anticipation this weekend after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thur	5	disease transmission; transmission covid19; coronaviruses pandemics

EDITORIAL Covid-19 blame game kicks off	Wanganui Chronicle	A game of international political football is under way. The match-up mainly pits the United States Government, caught flat-footed in the pandemic and trying to pin blame on China, where Covid-19 emerged. President Donald Trump, who refuses to shoulder any responsibility himself, thinks Beijing should. “It could have been stopped in China before it started, and it wasn’t.” US criticism of Beijing’s secretive, authoritarian system is shared by two of the hardest-hit countries, Britain and France.	6	political campaigns; diplomatic consular; consular services
Youth welfare demands clarity	The Australian	A gender clinic inquiry serves everyone, including trans kids The coronavirus pandemic has been an all-consuming challenge, but other health issues also require vigilance.

A complex strategic challenge	The Australian	In relating to China, Australia needs to stand its ground US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning about China ramping up its aggression in the South China Sea underlines the brazen opportunism of the Chinese Communist Party seeking to further its strategic ambitions while the world battles COVID-19.

Whereas his predecessors Bill English and Steven Joyce were usually fawned over by business figures, question and answer sessions with Robertson tended to involve lengthy pauses as the director community looked at their shoes as they digested lunch.

Immigration sweet spot to enhance skills and growth	The Australian	Infrastructure provision will take heat out of a divisive issue A week ago at the National Press Club, Scott Morrison was asked what role migration would play in the recovery. The Prime Minister drew on the work of demographer Peter McDonald. He said “the great professor” envisaged a net overseas migration target of between about 160,000 and 210,000 — the number you need here to maintain per capita growth in gross domestic product. Last financial year, migration added 240,000 to our population. 	8	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp

Staying on political course while managing the crises	The Australian	Scott Morrison promises to keep Australia safe and strong In a quieter age, Paul Keating mused the summer break was a chance for Australians to get back in touch with the country. “Mercifully free from work and politics, we have time to reflect,” he said 26 years ago on our national day. For some, that down time has led to the conclusion that the world has changed.

14 July 2020 EDITORIAL Coronavirus impact can last long beyond a patient’s ‘recovery’	The Northern Advocate	Seven months on, medical experts and researchers are still learning about the damage Covid-19 can do to people, short of killing them. The initial emphasis by authorities on the dangers of the coronavirus focused on the fact that it was new and deadly. It was a respiratory virus not the flu, there was no vaccine, and it was particularly a threat to older people and those with health vulnerabilities. Perhaps that messaging contributed to the idea that younger people were somewhat invulnerable. Th	1	coronaviruses covid19; social networks; demonstrations protests

In many respects, the shapes of alert level 4 and level 3 are very similar – work from home if you can, social distance, maintain small spheres of contact, wash hands with soap and cough into elbows, and if sick, stay home and co	3	pandemics covid19; coronaviruses pandemics; vaccines coronaviruses

The stadium is not an obvious pick. It was built for the 2010 Fifa World Cup — it’s where the All Whites famously drew 1-1 with Italy — and it holds only 41,000 people.

But, as many observers fear, we’ve also succumbed to complacency, failing to retool our economy to raise and sustain our living standards for the longer term.

Trump presidency dying in futile assault on democracy	The Australian	Under attack from mob violence, the US institutions stood resilient Wednesday, January 6, was a day of dark infamy, not epiphany, in the US when a mob of violent Donald Trump supporters, their rage fuelled by the defeated President’s lies about a stolen election, stormed the US Capitol.

Recent events have shown the extent to which the major developed nations understand the Chinese Communist Party’s bullying ways and are prepared to stand firmly alongside Australia. The CCP’s use of fake and outrageous images on Twitter in an attempt to undermine 	2	climate change; national security; environmental policy

It’s jam-packed with local news and regular features that we will publish weekly from now on. Among these features is a dedicated puzzles page which I’m excited that we’re providing. It’s good for your brain. I found an article by Dr Malvindar Singh-Bains, a research fellow at the Centre for Brain Research, who reminds us that we must look after this precious organ.

EDITORIAL Thank you all, and stay safe	The Daily Post	Well I know it’s hardly original to say this, but what a funny old year 2020’s been. From our first-ever experience of lockdown to the occasional community outbreak scares in late winter and spring, to the impact of job losses, the stress of Covid “pivots”, home-schooling and home working, the impact on local economies and the wider country generally ... it’s like nothing any of us has ever experienced before. So it’s with a great sense of relief that many of us are hanging out for a break over 	1	coronaviruses covid19; social networks; demonstrations protests
Securing economic revival has become more difficult	The Australian	We’ll need confidence and incentives to hire, expand, invest In the early phase of pandemic-induced economic shutdown, the Morrison government adopted a “whatever it takes” approach to splashing taxpayer funds on welfare to save businesses and jobs. Income support measures, such as the JobKeeper wage subsidy and a coronavirus supplement, had the virtue of being temporary, targeted, seemingly proportionate and delivered through established payment channels. In late March, the number of COVID-19 c	8	gross domestic; domestic product; product gdp
FROM THE EDITOR’S DESK Time to look at way we treat animals	Wanganui Chronicle	We’ve emerged from the pandemic lockdown. For most this has been a time of reflection, of reset. But how quickly we forget. We become self-absorbed, our panic and fear overtake the important lesson of this extraordinary lesson of our lifetime. I have never experienced this time, as have most of us. So how are we going to emerge back to normal? Which brings me to what caused the lockdown. Swine flu, mad cow disease, coronavirus, all take their names from animals. So what are we doing here? Have w	1	coronaviruses covid19; social networks; demonstrations protests

Hearing his story of growing up as a kid in Whangamatā with access to scrap metal and guys willing to weld for him from their back sheds made me reflect on being Kiwi. That inventive, curious attitude and the ability to relate to and seek help from older people with skills is what struck me about Dean’s story and about life in our small	1	coronaviruses covid19; social networks; demonstrations protests
University chiefs at a discount	The Australian	What higher education needs is some fresh ideas and bold leadership Like property prices, the salaries of vice-chancellors don’t always go up. As this newspaper reported on Monday, our oldest university, the University of Sydney, will pay its incoming chief, Mark Scott, 40 per cent less than the outgoing Michael Spence, who had pulled a staggering $1.6m. For that money you get almost three prime ministers. Other institutions, including the University of Adelaide and the Australian Catholic Unive	2	climate change; national security; environmental policy
Our View Washing is a dirty chore	Wanganui Chronicle	When it comes to microplastics, it appears the issue really does come out in the wash. Recent research (undertaken by Scion, the University of Canterbury, Auckland Council and Watercare, and funded by the Ministry for the Environment and Packaging NZ) has shown the tiny fibres released when washing our clothes are causing the single biggest microplastic pollution in Auckland’s waterways. Globally, it’s estimated eight million tonnes of plastics now enter the sea each year. The United Nations has	2	climate change; national security; environmental policy

FROM THE EDITOR Are we paying for too many tourists?	Bay of Plenty Times	Whether it’s public toilets at Onemana or a boardwalk on dunes at Whangamatā, the needs of the visitor — or creation of a so-called ‘visitor experience’ — is a debate we locals need to have. We’re not the only ones. Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment Simon Upton’s new report, Pristine, popular… imperilled? warns that domestic and international tourists are putting too much pressure on our environment.

FROM THE EDITOR Good trustees are important	Wanganui Chronicle	While I have always preferred English over maths, I do have at least a basic understanding of numbers. I know my Pythagoras from my pi and I know what a percentage is. So while I might not be able to solve the Riemann Hypothesis, I do know that 32.3 per cent is not exactly a high success rate. In fact, it’s a pretty dismal number. Especially when you realise it is the percentage of eligible voters who bothered to vote in the last Taranaki Electricity Trust (TET) Election three years ago.

COVID-19 disaster to our north	The Australian	While Western nations are stretched, Indonesia needs help Grim forecasts by the University of Indonesia of more than 120,000 coronavirus deaths by the end of May leave no doubt about the depth of the crisis confronting our northern neighbour as it battles the onslaught of the pandemic. While official figures claim just 3842 confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far, with 327 deaths, the university’s research suggests more than one million of the archipelago’s 270 million people have been infected.

Top produce needs new outlets	The Australian	While capricious, China has been a good trading partner As our economy begins recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, the suggestion that on Friday China will halt imports from Australia worth more than $6bn a year is grave news for a range of industries and their staff.

China’s tweet tests nation’s resolve in grey war zone	The Australian	While seeking to divide opinion, the slur united our open society The cliche about a week being a long time in politics has taken on dramatic salience during the past few days. A week ago Scott Morrison attempted to pour oil on troubled waters in our relations with China through a nuanced address to the Policy Exchange in London. The Prime Minister reassured Beijing that Australia did not view China purely through the lens of our deep alliance with the US.

This upcoming week is going to be a great one for Waihi, which kicks off the Repco Beach Hop festivities with the Warm Up party on Wednesday. We all deserve a good knees up after the year we’ve had — and thanks to all the volunteers that make the warm up party happen, that’s exactly what we’re in for.

Babies a bonus for small nations	The Australian	Willingness to have more children reflects optimism in the future Sixteen years after issuing his catchphrase, “have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country’’, in launching the Howard government’s $3000 baby bonus, Peter Costello’s call for the Morrison government to encourage Australians to again add to their families is timely.

EDITORIAL Time to be thankful for the rain	Bay of Plenty Times	With all guns blazing I’d hoped this past weekend would be an opportunity to get into the garden at last, but rain chased me out until a Sunday morning session planting native trees with a friend at Hikuai. We need to be so thankful for this rain.

In Western Australia, Mark McGowan is determined to wreck any hopes that national cabinet on Friday can reach a unified and sensible position on how to manage state borders. Instead, with a state election only weeks away, Mr McGowan is tapping deeply into populist sentiments in the west to keep outsiders out.

Digging a deep hole on water	The Australian	Without certainty, the politics of drought are fraught If both levels of government in Queensland needed any more reminders that perception is everything in politics, they were given one in spades this week courtesy of a proposed water mining operation near Warwick in the Darling Downs.
